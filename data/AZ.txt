Our reporting ecosystem
We place a premium on transparency and easy-to-find content. This report is part of a broader 
reporting ecosystem which covers sustainability topics relevant to Allianz Group. This year’s 
publications include:About this report
Allianz Group Accounting  
and Reporting Remit
As of the reporting cycle 2021, in line with 
our sustainability integration approach, 
responsibility for sustainability reporting 
shifted from Global Sustainability to 
Group Accounting and Reporting, 
which collaborates closely with Global 
Sustainability to produce this report. 
Our reporting approach
Reflecting our ambition to be the most trusted 
financial institution, we reflect our values of integrity, 
competence and resilience in our reporting. 
The content of this report is focused on the 
requirements of our stakeholders, relevant 
regulations, and sustainability rating and 
benchmarking providers. It focuses on the concepts 
and key performance indicators (KPIs) that reflect 
our most material sustainability issues and has 
been prepared in accordance with the Global 
Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards – core option. 
We are also assessing the option of Integrated 
Reporting and, as a first step, include a highlights 
KPI table which follows the International Integrated 
Reporting Council (IIRC) logic. 
  For more details, please see section 01.7 
2021 Reporting highlights 
We believe targets and performance information 
are essential for enhancing the quality, reliability 
and comparability of sustainability reporting. 
We are committed to disclosing data more 
meaningfully to improve our sustainability 
disclosures for internal decision-making and for 
our external stakeholders. As an investor, we also 
rely on this type of information to integrate 
sustainability into our core business activities. Non-financial

As part of this commitment, following the 
description of our sustainability approach and 
strategies, we have changed the structure of 
the main parts of our annual sustainability 
report to cover two main sections, both of 
which we consider equally important in terms 
of communicating our approach to material 
sustainability issues:
Measuring and managing our 
sustainability performance
Covering material topics and public targets and 
commitments that are integrated across Allianz 
and where we have established quantitative 
targets, KPIs and performance data.
Strengthening our foundation
Covering material topics and other topics related to 
ratings performance that are evolving towards fuller 
integration across Allianz and where our targets, 
KPIs and performance are continuing to evolve.

approach to reporting, please see section

Sustainability Report 2021

Every day, Allianz strives to earn the trust placed 
in us by our stakeholders and honor the role 
our company plays in society by truly living our 
purpose: Allianz is here to secure your future. 
Having stepped up to meet the challenges affecting 
the course of our planet, I am pleased to say 
that the broad range of Allianz’s sustainability 
efforts was recognized by highly respected 
external observers and through rigorous rating 
methodologies. To name only one example, 
we received the top rating in the 2021 Dow Jones 
Sustainability Index.
Over the course of 2021, a year once again 
dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic and its 
ensuing economic implications for individuals and 
communities, Allianz stood reliably at the side of 
our clients, our employees, and our shareholders.
In February 2022, when Russia invaded the 
democratic and independent nation of Ukraine, 
we made clear that Allianz stands with the free 
world. We stand with all people who believe in 
open and free societies, with all our employees, 
and with all people affected by these events. 
To underscore our support, we immediately 
earmarked donation funds totaling € 10 million 
for humanitarian needs and promised an 
additional € 2.5 million to match our employees’ 
and tied agents’ donations. As of March 31st 2022, 
our employees and tied agents have personally 
donated over € 1 million. The generosity of our 
people is only rivalled by their ingenuity, which is 
apparent in a range of business solutions to help 
humanitarian efforts in the affected region and 
neighboring countries.Allianz made good progress 
on climate ambition
2021 was another year where the climate 
predictions of science manifested in reality: 
the world is heating too fast and is becoming 
less resilient to more extreme weather in the form 
of storms, floods, heat waves and forest fires.
Recent events have redoubled focus on renewable 
energy, on the importance of solving the climate 
crisis and on the pursuit of a net-zero world 
to which Allianz has committed as part of the 
net-zero objective of Paris Climate Agreement. 
But decarbonization alone is not enough – 
we must address the social issues emerging from 
the net-zero transition particularly in view of rising 
energy and food prices, further exacerbated from 
the invasion of Ukraine.
For our Allianz investments, climate was again 
on top of the agenda: COP26 brought together 
governments and the industry on climate 
and regulation is increasingly focusing on the 
issue. Allianz believes public-private and peer 
partnerships are key to battle the climate 
challenges. We chair the U.N.-convened Net-Zero 
Asset Owner Alliance (AOA), by far the largest 
initiative in terms of true commitments towards 
a net-zero environment. The AOA was prominent 
at COP26 as it is the first public-private and peer 
alliance setting short-term (2025) targets for 
the decarbonization of investments. Within this 
context, Allianz in January 2021 announced 
concrete targets for 2025.01 Introduction

Sustainability Report 2021
0501.1 Message from the CEO
Broadening the net-zero commitments to insurance 
and asset management is an important element 
of our strategy. Therefore, Allianz also became a 
founding member of the U.N.-convened Net-Zero 
Insurance Alliance (NZIA) and our asset manager 
Allianz Global Investors became a member of 
the Net-Zero Asset Managers initiative during 
2021. Our insurance entities focus on climate risk 
management and aspire to use our insurance 
expertise to support the transformation of 
different sectors and customers towards net-zero. 
With natural catastrophes hitting communities 
around the world, we stood by our customers, 
notably the major floods across Europe caused 
by storm “Bernd”. We unbureaucratically covered 
more than 20,000 claims with an amount of more 
than € 1 billion.
The Allianz organization delivered on its climate 
targets: in 2021, we reduced the greenhouse 
gas emissions (GHG) per employee and 
increased renewable energy, ahead of our targets. 
This was mainly driven by lower energy use 
and more renewable electricity, as well as low 
business travel emissions, including effects from 
COVID-19 measures.Caring for our people
The Allianz organization prizes its employees 
and customers and cares for them accordingly: 
Convinced that vaccination will help the 
return to normality happen sooner, Allianz has 
conducted vaccination campaigns in 16 countries 
(e.g., Colombia, Germany, Ghana, Lebanon, 
Malaysia) in 2021.
We have highly motivated and highly loyal 
employees. Our Inclusive Meritocracy Index (IMIX) 
which measures the progress of the organization 
on its way towards inclusive meritocracy, stood at 
an excellent 78 % in 2021, exceeding our targets 
by 5 %-p.
Our efforts around diversity and inclusion 
are paying out: 
• Approximately 30 % of Allianz Group operating 
profit is managed by women, we see that 
diversity and performance go hand in hand. 
• Allianz is also in the top 5 of the Refinitiv 
Diversity & Inclusion Index 2021 globally and 
the number 1 insurance company.
• We also signed the ‘Valuable 500’ Charter and 
Allianz is one of 14 Iconic Leaders, who are 
co-creating solutions which will transform the 
business system to be more inclusive of people 
with disabilities. Together with London Stock 
Exchange Group (LSEG), Allianz is committed 
to increase transparency on disability data 
disclosure in the corporate space across 
the globe.Our efforts to improve and simplify our products 
and processes also led to increased customer 
loyalty, with NPS improving to 84 % in 2021 from 
previously 79 % of segments outperforming their 
respective market.
We also contributed to our local communities 
in 2021: Allianz’s charitable donations totaled 
€ 28.2 million, and our employees contributed 
72,580 hours in corporate volunteering.
We will take sustainability to the heart of 
Allianz – together
Allianz has the ambition, as well as the global 
scale and skills, to be the trusted partner of our 
stakeholders, helping to solve society’s most 
pressing issues. Already today, we are taking 
environmental, social and governance aspects to 
the heart of our business. Going forward, we are 
working to fully integrate sustainability into 
how we run our organization and our business 
alike, and to drive real world impact in societies, 
economies, and the environment. To support the 
sustainability integration, Global Sustainability 
was established as a Group Center as of January 
2021, and the Sustainability Committee was 
formed under our Supervisory Board in June 2021. 
In 2022, we will further integrate sustainability 
into Allianz’s organization and business areas 
and continue inspiring employees, customers, 
investors, and society.Please enjoy reading this report. And please 
feel encouraged to make your own contribution 
toward a more sustainable world. We are in 
this together.

Allianz Group is one of the world’s 
leading insurers and asset managers 
with 126 million private and corporate 
customers1 in more than 70 countries. 
Our customers benefit from a broad range of 
personal and corporate insurance services, 
ranging from property, life, and health insurance 
to assistance services to credit insurance and 
global business insurance. As one of the world’s 
largest investors, Allianz is managing around 
€ 849 billion on behalf of its insurance customers. 
Furthermore, our asset managers PIMCO 
and Allianz Global Investors manage nearly 
€ 2.0 trillion of third-party assets. Thanks to 
our systematic integration of environmental, 
social and governance (ESG) criteria in our 
business processes and investment decisions, 
we hold the leading position for insurers in 
the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. In 2021, 
155,4112 employees achieved total revenues 
of € 148.53 billion and an operating profit of 
€ 13.44 billion for the group.
Our purpose and strategy 
Our purpose is ‘We secure your future’. It is our 
reason for being and it guides our decisions and 
actions across the Allianz Group.
Allianz has defined the following objectives for our 
medium-term strategy, building on the success of 
the efforts to simplify the company, with the motto 
‘Simplicity at Scale’: GRI
102-14
• Outperform: We seek to move ahead of our 
competitors, both traditional businesses and 
disruptors, to drive profitable growth. 
• Transform: We seek to become simpler and 
deeply digital, and to put – in addition to the 
customer – scalability at the heart of our actions.
• Rebalance: We seek to build leading positions in 
large, profitable, and fast-growing geographies 
as well as in new areas of business. An increased 
focus will be placed on an organic rebalancing 
of the business mix.
To realize our growth ambition and accelerate our 
value creation, we have identified five additional 
strategic areas of focus: 
• Transforming the Life/Health and Asset 
Management franchise 
• Expanding our Property & Casualty 
leadership position 
• Boosting growth through scalable platforms 
• Deepening the global vertical integration and 
execution of agility 
• Reinforcing capital productivity and resilience
Sustainability integration is an important element 
of the strategy implementation. We aim at carefully 
balancing across stakeholders, at the same time 
as we deliver benchmark results at scale and build 
strong resilience in a transforming world.

Corporate Strategy, please see the Allianz

01.3.1 Our ambition 
We support the transformation towards 
sustainable economies and societies this means 
that we want our economy to provide the societal 
minimum for all while not breaking ecological 
barriers, our ambition is to integrate sustainability 
into everything that happens at Allianz, into our 
decision making, thereby driving real world impact 
in societies, economies and the environment. 
We aspire to listen to our stakeholders, take care 
to understand their concerns, and ensure that 
our actions meet their expectations. To be able 
to deliver impact, we believe in collaboration 
and partnerships, as many of the sustainability-
related matters require global action beyond 
company boundaries.
We prioritize three U.N. Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) to guide the 
integration of sustainability across Allianz. 
With this sustainability focus, we plan to tackle 
societal, environmental, and economic change: 
• Decent work and economic growth (SDG 8) is in 
line with our aspiration to be a trusted partner 
for protecting and growing stakeholders most 
valuable assets;
• Climate action (SDG 13) is in line with our 
commitments to net-zero by 2050 and the 
Net-Zero Alliances; 
• Partnerships for the goals (SDG 17) is 
in line with our belief that the public/
private and peers need to cooperate to 
improve sustainability.
• Environment (E) – Our climate approach / 
focus on SDG 13
• Social (S) – Our social approach / 
focus on SDG 8
• Governance (G) – Our approach to 
sustainability integrationAll three are closely interlinked, so we refer to 
sustainability in general rather than to ESG.
  Please see our targets and commitments in 
section 05.1 and 05.3. for a detailed overview.
01.3.2 Enabling the integration 
of sustainability
Allianz increased the importance of sustainability 
on our agenda in 2021 with the ambition to fully 
integrate sustainability across the company. 
The Board of Management at Allianz SE is 
ultimately responsible for all matters related 
to sustainability and is supported by the Sustainability Board (formerly known as ESG 
Board). During 2021, Allianz further established 
the Group Center Global Sustainability, and the 
Sustainability Committee within the Supervisory 
Board, to enable the sustainability strategy 
integration and implementation.
Equally important is the integration of sustainability 
across Allianz as an organization (operations, 
HR, finance and risk, communication), and across 
all business areas (insurance, investments, 
asset management). The different functions 
are responsible for driving sustainability into 
their strategies and actions.Global Sustainability leads, coordinates and supports 
the functions and operating entities to effectively 
integrate the Group’s strategic sustainability approach 
and policies into their strategies and activities. 
Sustainability-related performance is also integrated 
in our compensation systems through relevant 
targets incentivizing board members to act and 
decide according to E, S and G priorities. Information 
about the board targets are shown below.
  For more details on the integration of 
sustainability in our corporate governance, 
please see section 05.5.

01.4.1 Our ambition 
Our social approach is based on the belief that 
business can only thrive as part of an equitable 
society. Under our purpose ‘We secure your future’ 
we aim to contribute by being the trusted partner 
for protecting and growing our stakeholders’ most 
valuable assets.
With an added focus on SDG 8 – Decent 
work and economic growth – we integrate 
social considerations into our organization, 
our business areas, and our corporate citizenship 
activities. We do this through our own initiatives 
and – in line with our commitment to SDG 17, 
Partnerships for the goals – through active 
participation in various partnerships from global 
U.N.-backed initiatives to collaborations with 
regional NGOs and local charities. 
With our global footprint, we have an opportunity 
to create positive impact through the way we run 
our organization and by using our expertise as an 
investor, insurer and asset manager. We contribute 
to our stakeholders and societies in different ways:
• We distributed economic value of € 104 billion 
to our stakeholders, for example through 
claims payments, wages, and taxes. 
Through these payments, we are making a 
meaningful contribution to the economic and 
social development of the countries in which 
we operate.
• We developed our Diversity and Inclusion 
strategy to cover gender, generations, LGBTQ+, 
nationalities, and disabilities.
• Through our products and solutions, we can 
enable access to financial services which take 
sustainability into consideration.• With our Corporate Citizenship Strategy, we help 
next generations to overcome economic and 
social impacts; and we support in crisis situations 
like the pandemic and the Ukraine humanitarian 
situation. For the Ukraine humanitarian crisis 
Allianz committed to donate € 10 million and 
is committed to match employees’ and tied 
agents’ donations up to € 2.5 million. 
• By the date that this report is published, 
Allianz confirms that we are neither insuring 
new business nor making new investments on 
behalf of its own investment portfolio in Russia 
or Belarus. Our operating entities are no longer 
underwriting new insurance business in Russia, 
and are decisively reducing exposure in an 
orderly manner.
01.4.2 Our commitment to 
human rights
Respect for human rights is a minimum requirement 
for responsible business within and beyond our 
direct operations. For Allianz, human rights are 
relevant in our different roles – as an insurer, investor,

01.5.1 Our ambition
Our climate approach is grounded in the Allianz 
Group Climate Change Strategy. With a special 
focus on SDG 13 – Climate action, we integrate 
climate considerations in our organization and our 
business areas. We further strengthen our climate 
action by collaborating with private and public 
partners, in line with SDG 17 – Partnerships for the 
goals. Examples for such partnerships include the 
U.N.-Convened Net-Zero alliances.
We have the ambition to be a partner for our 
clients and investees, and for the different sectors, 
in their transition towards net-zero. 
01.5.2 Our commitments 
and contributions
Our climate approach is an integral part of our 
core business. By committing to net-zero GHG 
emissions by 2050, we are working on setting 
long-term climate targets across our operations 
and business lines in line with the 1.5°C ambition1 
of the Paris Climate Agreement. The Allianz SE 
Board of Management’s remuneration is tied in 
part to the attainment of these targets. 
• On our overall goal to create positive change 
for societies and economies, we will continue 
to integrate climate action across all business 
areas and markets and deliver on our net-
zero targets. 
• For our proprietary investment portfolio, 
we are on track to systematically reduce 
GHG emissions to net-zero in line with the 
2050 pathway. Our intermediate target is to 
reduce our emissions from listed equities and 
corporate bonds by 25 percent by year-end 
2024 (vs. 2019). Our work is aligned with the 
1 We are managing towards 1.5°C with low/no overshoot pathways.
2 U.N.-convened Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance.Target Setting Protocol of the AOA2, where we 
have taken on a shaping role. Also, our fully 
owned real estate portfolio is intended to be 
in line with scientifically based 1.5°C pathways 
with low/no overshoot by year-end 2024. 
• To define science-based climate targets in our 
insurance portfolio, we – as a member of the 
Net-Zero Insurance Alliance – are currently 
working on the targets and methodologies. 
These methodologies are expected to be 
published in January 2023. Subsequently, 
Allianz and other members will be able to 
set their first near term net-zero insurance 
targets. All members have committed to report 
annually on their progress. 
• We will continue to gradually implement our 
phaseout of coal-based business models across 
our proprietary investments and P&C portfolios 
by 2040 in line with 1.5°C pathways with low/no 
overshoot. This includes a stricter threshold for 
coal-based business models for P&C insurance 
(25 percent as of 31 December 2022); for our 
investment portfolios from current 30 percent 
to 25 percent, as of 31 December 2022. 
• We also announced that we will no longer 
provide insurance for dedicated oil sands 
projects and new oil sands pipelines, or to 
companies deriving more than 20 percent of 
their revenue from oil sands.
• We will publish an update of our Oil & Gas 
policy and a new target for our GHG emissions 
from own operations on 29 April 2022. 
 Find out more on our website.
• In our operations, we will increase the use of 
renewable electricity to run our data centers 
and offices to 100 percent by end of 2023 
and reduce GHG emission per employee by 
30 percent in 2025 (vs 2019). 01.5.3 Our Climate 
Change Strategy
Allianz has had a Climate Change Strategy 
in place since 2005. The current strategy was 
approved by the Group Sustainability Board 
in 2019. With the rapid development of the 
state of knowledge on climate-related matters, 
we continually review our Climate Change 
strategy, to secure that our action continues to 
be in line with science. The strategy is built around 
the three pillars, through which we can have an 
impact: Anticipate. Care. Enable.
We anticipate the risks of a 
changing climate 
Our climate strategy aims to anticipate the risks of 
a changing climate. Therefore, we systematically 
consider climate and sustainability criteria in 
our insurance and investment business. In 2021, 
we reviewed our approach to identifying and 
managing climate change risks and opportunities 
to develop it further. 
We also systematically engage with investee 
companies, which are exposed to high climate 
and sustainability risks. We offer advice and 
encourage them to define and pursue their 
own climate strategies in line with the latest 
scientific findings. 
As part of our decarbonization strategy, we commit 
to fully withdrawing from coal-based business 
models across our proprietary investment and 
property-casualty portfolios by 2040 at the latest.
We care for the climate vulnerable
We support our insurance customers so that they can 
reduce climate-related risks. The target is to minimize 
damage, and insure low-carbon developments. Furthermore, we are piloting new approaches that 
combine insurance offerings with measures that 
strengthen their resilience. These are, for instance, 
approaches to incentivize people to reduce 
risk including dedicated training and advice. 
Also, we use climate risk-differentiated premium 
structures in our insurance.
Many people still do not have insurance at all. 
To close this the protection gap in the most 
vulnerable parts of society, we collaborate 
with our peers, governments, and civil society. 
We support scientific research and innovation 
that improves society’s understanding of climate-
related risks.
We enable the low-carbon transition
We aim to enable the journey to net-zero for our 
own operations, for our investees and for our 
insurance customers. Our ambition is to be an 
insurance and investment partner for the net-
zero transformation the different industries and 
customers need to make. 
Our business strategy aims to systematically 
enable a low-carbon and climate-resilient future. 
We strategically invest in low-carbon assets 
and are insuring low-carbon technologies. 
Grounded in our belief in science-based decision 
making, we intend to support our partners, 
investees, and clients along the path to net-zero. 
We also commit to pursing net-zero within our 
own operations.

activities in sections 02.1, 02.2, and 02.3 and

05 Our universal principles01.6 Our sustainability integration approach
Our commitment to tackling 
environmental, social, and 
governance (ESG, here 
referred to as sustainability) 
topics ensures we embed 
sustainability everywhere, 
both in our own operations 
and across our insurance, 
proprietary investment, and 
asset management activities. 
As a global insurer, investor, and asset manager, 
understanding and managing sustainability issues 
allows us to reduce risks and capture opportunities 
in all areas of our business. As well as managing 
risks, sustainability integration directs us to create 
sustainable products and services that add value 
to society, collaborate with clients and investees to 
deliver real-world benefits and direct capital flows 
towards sustainable outcomes for all stakeholders. 
01.6.1 What is sustainability 
and why it is important? 
Sustainability (or ESG) risks and opportunities 
refer to the non-financial risks and opportunities 
which can be influenced by and/ or can influence 
Allianz’s business activities and operations. In the 
Allianz Group Risk Policy, we define sustainability 
risks as events or conditions which, if they occur, 
could have significant negative impacts on the 
assets, profitability, or reputation of Allianz Group 
or one of its companies. Sustainability integration processes Business areas Details
P&C Ins. Investments 
(listed)Investments 
(non-listed)Organization, 
Procurement
ESG referral and assessment process (including 
sensitive business areas, sensitive countries)Systematic integration of sustainability risks by conducting 
case-by-case due diligence of critical transactions.
ESG scoring process (including climate-
related data)Systematic integration of sustainability risks through 
sustainability ratings and climate-related data.
ESG exclusions process (including coal, oil sands, 
controversial weapons, human rights)Exclusion of investment and insurance transactions in 
critical business areas. 
ESG engagement and risk dialogues (on 
sustainability, climate and human rights topics)Systematic engagement with investee companies and 
clients on sustainability-related matters.
ESG in business partner selection (including asset 
managers, reinsurers, vendors, etc.)Inclusion of sustainability-related criteria in the selection, 
appointment and monitoring of business partners.Examples include environmental and climate 
change risks, human rights violations, risks to 
local communities and workforce risks. If they 
are not identified and managed effectively, 
sustainability risks can have significant 
repercussions for Allianz and our customers, 
suppliers and invested companies. These span 
legal and reputational risks, supply chain and 
business disruption risks, quality and operational 
risks and financial risks. 
Sustainability factors also present business 
opportunities such as insuring and investing 
in renewable energy and affordable housing 
or supporting the energy transition through 
insurance and investments.
By scrutinizing insurance and investments 
projects from a sustainability perspective, 
Allianz extends its understanding of risks and 
seizes potential business opportunities for the 
benefit of shareholders, customers, and other 
stakeholders. Holistic assessment of risk is 
especially relevant to Allianz as an insurance 
company that manages and carries risks ranging 
from single events to decades. 01.6.2 Our group-wide rules 
and processes 
Our approach applies group-wide corporate 
rules and sustainability processes across all 
relevant underwriting, proprietary investment, 
and operations activities. This requires strong 
collaboration between relevant functions 
and business areas. Key processes include the 
internal Allianz Standard for Reputational Risk 
Management and other corporate rules such as 
the Allianz Standards for P&C Underwriting and 
Allianz ESG Functional Rule for Investments. 
The publicly available Allianz ESG Integration 
Framework provides transparency around our 
sustainability-related processes and guidelines. 
We published the fourth version of the 
Framework in 2021. 
Our asset management units have set up their 
own set of processes, rules, and governance on 
sustainability integration in their investment activities.
01.6.3 Embedding sustainability 
in insurance, proprietary 
investments and operations 
Consistent application of sustainability processes 
in insurance and proprietary investment activities is 
crucial to mitigate risks and capture opportunities 
arising from sustainability trends. 
We have put in place the processes outlined in the 
table below across our business.
  Further details on our sustainability integration 
approach in insurance, proprietary investments, 
and asset management can be found in section 
02.1 to 02.3 as well as in the Allianz ESG 
Integration Framework.

Reviewing and revising our sustainability 
risk management framework 
We continue to expand and strengthen our 
sustainability risk management approach. A key 
enabling factor is understanding the requirements 
and limitations of our operating entities to 
develop global sustainability processes that can 
be integrated into local processes and systems.
In 2021, we continued our project to further 
strengthen sustainability risk management by 
improving the way we identify sustainability-
related risks in transactions (P&C insurance, 
investment, procurement). While this project was 
planned for completion in 2021 based on the 
original scope which included only P&C insurance, 
we have expanded the scope to cover insurance, 
investments, procurement, and other business 
areas. We also expanded the project scope to 
consider human rights in more depth. As a result, 
we extended the deadline and work will continue 
into 2022.

2021 2020 201901.6.4 Regulation as a driver 
of sustainability integration 
We believe regulation is necessary to drive 
integration of sustainability considerations 
in business activities and we actively engage 
in supporting and influencing regulatory 
developments in these areas. For example, 
we are a member of the E.U.’s Platform on 
Sustainable Finance and European Financial 
Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) Project Task 
Force on European Sustainability Reporting 
Standards (PTF-ESRS). We are focused on several 
workstreams to address new regulatory and 
supervisory requirements.

In this part of the ‘Measuring and managing sustainability’ section, 
we focus on topics which we can quantify and then give an overview 
of the key approaches. In addition, this part describes how we 
manage our business to drive forward sustainability.
We have set quantitative targets for our Board of Management  
to work towards reducing the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)  
of our proprietary investment portfolio by 25 percent by end of 2024. 
Also for our insurance and asset management activities, 
sustainability integration continues to be a priority; we are in 
the process of setting quantitative targets.
For all areas, we have a long-standing set of indicators to disclose 
our sustainability performance across our business activities. 
  The performance of our Board of Management regarding 
their sustainability targets is on track. For a detailed

02.1.1 Integrating sustainability 
in insurance
Embedding sustainability considerations 
into our insurance business means we 
are better placed to manage risks and 
opportunities to support sustainable 
development. We add value through 
dialogue with stakeholders and aim to 
share our expertise on risk mitigation 
with the insurance sector.
We are committed to the UNEP-FI Principles 
for Sustainable Insurance and work so that our 
risk exposure is mostly indirect through the risks 
Allianz carries for its insured clients. We embed 
strong sustainability risk management throughout 
our underwriting processes to limit our exposure 
to indirect risks. Our sustainability referral and 
assessment process directs us to identify, assess and 
manage risks. The process is part of the risk 
management framework that is applied to all 
Allianz insurance business globally, whether we 
are the lead insurer or part of a panel. 
When our insurance underwriters identify a 
sustainability risk, they refer the case for assessment 
by the Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty (AGCS) 
ESG Business Services and/or Global Sustainability 
at Allianz SE. Our experts conduct in-depth 
assessments on a broad range of sustainability 
risks. Based on the outcome of these assessments, 
they decide whether a transaction may proceed 
with or without conditions. Conditions may include 
monitoring the project/client or engaging in a 
risk dialogue. If severe, systemic or unmitigable 
sustainability issues are identified, the transaction 
may be declined.In 2021, 850 insurance transactions were assessed 
for sustainability risks, up from 430 transactions 
in 2020.
This increase is in line with our expectations given 
a decreasing risk appetite, new internal guidance 
on issues such as decarbonization and human 
rights, and new technical criteria in underwriting. 
See  Tables ESG-1 to 3 for additional details.
Sustainability risks can be dynamic and complex. 
Being responsible for a large underwriting 
portfolio requires significant resources to 
continuously screen and assess risks and engage 
clients and brokers in risk dialogues. 
  Further information about the Allianz 
sustainability approach and processes 
relating to our insurance business 
can be found in the Allianz ESG 
Integration Framework.
Adding value through research 
and engagement
To maximize our positive influence and impact, 
we share our sustainability expertise with 
our clients, brokers and business partners, 
and develop our own risk management and 
underwriting due diligence. 
We conduct in-depth research to stay ahead 
of emerging issues and inform our evolving 
approach to risk identification and management. 
This includes conducting research to understand 
the relevance of sustainability factors on claims 
and underwriting profitability.Key developments in 2021
In 2021, our experts worked to further strengthen 
our decarbonization approach. Our long-standing 
coal phase-out approach was strengthened and 
expanded (see section 02.2.3 for further details). 
We also announced that we will no longer provide 
insurance for dedicated oil sands projects and 
new oil sands pipelines, or to companies deriving 
more than 20 percent of their revenue from 
oil sands.
In 2020, we initiated a pilot to enhance our due 
diligence for Director & Officers (D&O) insurance. 
In 2021, this resulted in the addition of an ESG 
D&O Risk Score and other significant ESG KPIs 
to our underwriting due diligence for D&O 
coverages. We have now launched a similar 
project for liability insurance.
02.1.2 Climate change 
and decarbonization
Through our insurance business, 
we anticipate risks and protect and care 
for people vulnerable to climate change. 
We also target our insurance solutions 
and expertise to support the transition 
to a low-carbon economy.
Our Climate Change Strategy is focused on 
providing insurance solutions that help customers 
respond to a changing climate and facilitate the 
development of the low-carbon economy with 
net-zero emissions in 2050 (see section 01.5).We anticipate the risks of a 
changing climate
The Paris Agreement emphasizes the role of 
insurance in managing the impacts of climate 
change. Insurance companies need to address 
climate change risks in both their insurance and 
their investment portfolios. These risks can result 
from developments in weather patterns (physical 
risks) and the transformation of business models 
towards net-zero emissions (transition risks). 
In parallel, insurers have a societal role to offer 
affordable insurance protection against extreme 
weather events such as floods, storms, heatwaves 
and droughts for their clients. With 1.5°C of global 
warming being almost unavoidable according to 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change1 
(IPCC), this is becoming a challenge. It is a key 
reason why Allianz is committed to playing its 
part in limiting global warming by the end of this 
century to a maximum of 1.5°C. 
With extreme weather events becoming more 
common and intense, we research the actual and 
future impacts of climate change to provide the 
best possible risk advice to society and customers. 
For example, the Allianz Climate Change Risk 
Study (ACCRiS) provides inhouse climate risk 
scores and metrics. These hazard, risk and 
financial impact scores help to assess physical 
climate change risk in investment and insurance 
decisions. In 2021, we developed forward-looking 
metrics for river flood and tropical cyclone risk 
under two climate scenarios2 for the time periods 
2030 and 2050. In 2022, we aim to provide metrics 
on hail and coastal flood risk.01 Introduction

Understanding of climate risks
The future impact of climate change will depend 
significantly on the political will to address the 
crisis and the speed at which it can be managed. 
If emissions are reduced swiftly enough, warming 
can be limited and the resulting risk might be kept 
at an affordable level for the insurance sector in 
developed insurance markets. 
If climate-related risks like extreme weather 
events become high, the public sector and the 
insured may need to take more risk. This could 
be in the form of investment in higher protection 
standards such as flood defenses or higher risk 
retentions. The warmer it gets, the more likely 
challenges for insurability arise. This could burden 
clients and societies, especially in highly exposed 
regions such as low-lying coastal areas.
Managing this challenge requires constant 
and open dialogue to foster understanding of 
the issues and better resilience to climate risks. 
In November 2021, we held the second annual 
Allianz Understanding Climate Risk Stakeholder 
Dialogue and Award. Stakeholders from Allianz 
and partner institutions came together virtually 
to focus on building an understanding of climate 
impacts, identifying threats and opportunities, 
and charting a common path for action through 
dialogue between academics, public sector 
and industry. The winner of the fifth annual Allianz Climate Risk 
Research Award for young PhD students working 
on innovative approaches to address climate 
risks was Dr. Nina Ridder. Her research focuses 
on compound events – events during which two 
weather or climate-related hazards co-occur – 
which can have devastating effects.
  Find out more about the Allianz Climate Risk 
Research Award online here.
Caring for the climate vulnerable 
Closing the insurance gap
We actively support the InsuResilience Global 
Partnership (IGP)’s goal to provide climate risk 
insurance for up to 500 million people in the 
most vulnerable developing countries by 2025. 
To promote this goal, the German Federal Ministry 
for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(BMZ) set up the InsuResilience Solutions Fund 
(ISF) to fund product and solution development. 
Delphine Traoré Maidou, Allianz Africa’s Chief 
Executive Officer, represents Allianz as one of two 
private sector representatives on the IGP’s High-
Level Consultative Group. 
In the context of the Tripartite Agreement 
between BMZ, the U.N. Development Program 
and the Insurance Development Forum (IDF), 
Allianz and Swiss Re are co-leading a project 
to develop a sovereign disaster risk insurance 
solution for Ghana with support by the local 
UNDP office. For this project we applied for 
co-funding from ISF in 2021. At the end of the 
year, we received a conditional grant approval. 
In 2022, we will formally launch the project.The overall project objective is to provide quick 
pay-outs from a parametric flood cover to 
enhance the response capacity of the National 
Disaster Management Organization (NADMO) 
of Ghana in severe flood cases to re-establish 
economic activity of low-income communities in 
urban areas, starting with Greater Accra Region. 
The project builds on the lessons learnt from 
Allianz/GIZ Public-Private Partnership (PPP) 
project (2018–2021) in Ghana. 
The U.N.-convened Net-Zero 
Insurance Alliance 
In July 2021, Allianz joined forces with seven 
other leading insurers to form the U.N.-convened 
Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA). The first of 
its kind net-zero network for the underwriting 
business was launched alongside the G20 summit, 
underlining the importance of cooperation between 
leading governments and companies to mitigate 
the risks of climate change. Cross-industry and 
international partnerships are seen as important 
levers for tackling global challenges. 
Members will set for themselves measurable 
and science-based targets. The first targets are 
expected to be released by July 2023 latest for the 
target year 2030. After 2030, they will be updated 
every five years up to 2050. Once the first targets 
are set, members are required to report on their 
progress on an annual basis. Having begun in 
2021 and continuing throughout 2022, the group 
will develop the respective methodologies and 
define the first intermediate target in the NZIA 
target-setting protocol, which is expected to be 
launched in January 2023.In September 2021, the NZIA announced that 
it will collaborate with the Partnership for 
Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) to develop 
a global standard to measure and disclose 
greenhouse gas emissions associated with re-/
insurance portfolios. Such a standard will help 
re-/insurers obtain a deeper understanding of 
the climate risks in the underwriting portfolios, 
help them to decarbonize their portfolios through 
target setting, scenario analysis, etc., and create 
comparability for stakeholders.

02.1.3 Natural disasters
Natural disasters – including 
earthquakes, fires, floods and storms – 
can devastate communities and recovery 
can take years. Allianz has expertise in 
insuring both individuals and businesses 
against these perils and risks. We are 
constantly improving our tools to identify 
and manage risks and support our 
customers when the worst happens.
Socio-economic shifts, global interdependencies 
and climate change all play a role in the 
changing extent of weather-related insurance 
losses. According to the World Economic Forum’s 
(WEF) Global Risk Report 20211, two of the top 
five global risks are linked to environmental 
disasters and extreme weather. In the short-term 
(0–2 years), extreme weather events rank third 
in the list of critical risks threatening the world. 
Climate action failure is identified as the most 
impactful and second most likely long-term risk. 
The losses associated with natural disasters 
have increased 15-fold in recent decades,2 
implying high risk and volatility for the insurance 
industry. The Allianz Risk Barometer 20213 
places natural catastrophes sixth in its ranking 
of global business risks. Economic losses were 
estimated to total around $80bn of global 
insured losses in 2020, up more than 40 percent 
from 2019. 65 percent of losses caused by 
natural catastrophes over the past decade were 
uninsured as the protection gap widened.4   Read more about how we are managing 
the risks of a changing climate in section 
02.1.2 under the heading ‘Caring for the 
climate vulnerable’.
Increasing resilience for our 
customers and society
The primary role of the insurance sector is to 
absorb strong financial impacts that would 
otherwise overwhelm the capabilities of private 
and commercial clients. In doing so, we provide 
stability to societies and economies by ensuring 
businesses can be re-started quickly and people 
can re-build their homes following a catastrophe. 
We also advise clients on risk preventive 
measures to minimize their risks – both to 
reduce potential financial impacts and to keep 
businesses operational. 
To scale our positive impact, we research and 
analyze the risk situation for all natural perils 
in all countries where we operate. We offer 
this knowledge to policymakers to support 
sustainable development and shape resilience 
measures. Climate change is a critical factor we 
must account for as an insurer and by sharing 
our expertise to support resilience. For example, 
we develop projects under the umbrella of 
InsuResilience on behalf of the Insurance 
Development Forum (see section 02.1.2). 
  Find out more in section 02.1.2 under the 
heading ‘Caring for the climate vulnerable’.Assessing natural catastrophe risk
Experts at Allianz Reinsurance (Allianz 
Re) include meteorologists, hydrologists, 
geophysicists, geographers and mathematicians. 
Together, they model around 50 natural 
catastrophe (Nat Cat) Nat Cat scenarios for the 
Group using data captured according to best-
in-class standards. Applying their risk expertise 
to the Allianz portfolio with its insured values, 
our experts assess overall exposure to Nat Cat 
risks. Vendor and in-house applications provide a 
comprehensive risk profile of any defined location 
which can be used as the basis for effective risk 
management measures. This is also used to 
develop risk-based pricing for Nat Cat perils and 
to provide portfolio managers with insight into 
local and regional accumulation of risks.
Allianz Re is constantly improving Cat Risk 
Management at Group and local levels. In 2021, 
we made substantial progress in establishing the 
Catastrophe Target Architecture. This includes 
the Allianz Modelling Platform, which will host 
all internally developed Nat Cat risk models. 
Through a standardized framework and process 
automation, the platform enables us to leverage 
our catastrophe claims history and our view of 
risk, for example to incorporate an estimation of 
potential climate change impacts. We also continue to enhance our geoinformation 
system (GIS) tools. This enables us to deepen our 
understanding based on the exact geolocation 
of a customer’s house or a company’s production 
site. For floods, a peril which is expected to be 
impacted most by climate change, the difference 
of a few meters can have a big impact on the risk 
profile of a location. 
The latest developments add vital capabilities to 
our applications, such as enabling underwriters 
to access detailed risk scores by individual Nat 
Cat peril for every location globally. We have also 
generated a method to describe and evaluate 
climate change-driven adjustments in natural 
hazard and flood risk. Our next step is to assess 
risks from other perils and integrate these into our 
decision-making processes (see section 4.5.2).02.1  Sustainability in insurance

Our purpose – ‘We secure your future’ – 
includes providing emerging consumers 
with affordable and effective insurance 
solutions. Allianz is committed to closing 
the protection gap and providing access 
to affordable insurance solutions to 
support lower income populations. 02.1  Sustainability in insurance
1  The number of insured people and revenue data includes figures from non-
consolidated entities outside the reporting boundaries (GRI 102-45).
2 Due to change in scope, additional 15.5mn insured reported from Indian 
government-sponsored health schemes.Increasing the resilience of the most vulnerable 
against the risks they face is one way in which 
we create positive social impact through our 
core business.
Reaching underinsured customers
The emerging consumers market, defined as 
lower-income populations in Africa, Asia and 
Latin America, consists of more than half of the 
world’s population. Emerging consumers are 
usually first-time buyers of formal insurance 
products and often do not have a bank account. 
Developing non-traditional offerings, innovative 
distribution models and accessible payment channels are strategies to reach and service this 
target segment. Products and processes must 
be simple and relatable and distribution models 
need to be cost-efficient to maximize client value.
Digitalization is unleashing opportunities, 
with affordable insurance and health services 
increasingly delivered via mobile technology. 
This trend accelerated during the COVID-19 
pandemic. To leverage these opportunities, we are 
expanding our partnerships with companies that 
provide digital technologies and go-to-market 
approaches to complement our core capabilities, 
tailored to the requirements of the emerging 
consumers segment. Examples of our core emerging consumer 
solutions include Credit Life Insurance, 
Funeral Insurance, Health insurance and 
Crop insurance. 
In 2021, we insured 62.2 million people2 in 
the emerging consumers segment (2020: 46.1 mn 
insured). Revenues were at € 510.2 million 
(2020: € 452.2 mn) – equivalent to around € 8.2 
in annual revenue per insured2 for this market. 
Allianz consolidated entities served 9.7 million 
insured (2020: 10 mn) and contributed revenues 
of € 45.2 million. Additional data about our 
emerging consumer business can be found in

…by building the next generation of healthcare and insurance solutions
In summer 2019, we teamed up with emerging 
market digital healthcare and insurance leader 
BIMA and German development agency GIZ to 
grow affordable digital healthcare subscription 
plans in a sustainable way. Our shared aim 
was to reach one hundred thousand additional 
customers in Ghana with new offerings supported 
by a new type of hybrid retail delivery model. 
A key endeavor was to smartly combine face-to-
face interaction with digital elements to ensure continuous customer engagement after 
a human-touch sale. Core elements developed 
within the project include 1) a customer-centric app 
for sales agents, 2) customer experience centers, 
3) digital onboarding journeys, 4) digital health 
programs providing advice on health needs. 
Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of 
insured grew from 80k in 2019 to 184k in 2021, 
with 87 percent of active customers subscribing 
to receive health programs and 40+ percent of customers indicating they can better manage 
their health thanks to the offering.
This is evidence that it is possible to sustainably 
run direct-to-consumer healthcare subscription 
and microinsurance models, which is a huge step 
towards effectively addressing the protection 
needs of many undeserved population groups in 
emerging markets.

02.1.5 Sustainable solutions 
Through our sustainable insurance solutions, 
we enable customers to be more sustainable and 
create positive impacts for the environment and 
society. We promote a more equitable society 
through access to financial products and services 
for people on lower incomes. As part of our 
sustainable solutions approach, we also track 
such solutions from our asset managers. To learn 
more about their approach (see section 02.3).
Allianz local entities and global lines work 
continuously to innovate and develop new 
and existing sustainable products and services 
for customers: 
• We are a partner in the transition to a low-
carbon economy, delivering products and 
services with a positive environmental or 
climate-related impact (see section 01.5). 
• Our insurance, risk management solutions 
and advice enable individuals, companies and 
governments to implement renewable energy 
projects and manage climate-related risks 
(see section 02.1.2).We differentiate between three categories of sustainable solutions when we define and develop sustainable solutions:
Sustainable solutions categories
Sustainable 
insurance 
solutionsSustainable insurance solutions are products and services that directly 
address environmental and/or social risks and opportunities.Examples include: 
• Insurance coverage for electric vehicles and development of batteries; 
• Life and health insurance products targeted at people with disabilities 
and designed to offer the necessary benefits.
Insurance solutions 
with a sustainability 
componentThe inclusion of sustainability components in standard products is 
becoming increasingly common. In 2018, we decided to differentiate 
standard insurance products with additional environmental and/or 
social benefits.Examples include: 
• Add-ons to standard home insurance products offering environmental-
friendly upgrades; 
• Premium insurance discount for electric vehicles.
Emerging 
consumer 
solutionsEmerging consumer solutions include affordable microinsurance and 
other insurance products that cater to customers entering financial 
services markets for the first time.Examples include: 
• Life and health insurance products at affordable premiums; 
• Third-party liability motorcycle cover at affordable premiums.

What do we mean by sustainable solutions? 
Examples of Allianz products with an environmental or social added value02.1  Sustainability in insurance
Sustainable solutions evaluation
In order to be classified as a sustainable solution, 
a product or service must fulfil at least one of six 
environmental and social criteria, described in 
further detail in section 03.11.1 of the Allianz ESG 
Integration Framework. For products categorized 
as sustainable under this definition, we track and 
publish key metrics such as revenue. 
As sustainability classification and product 
labeling regulation is increasing in many markets, 
we have kicked-off projects to review our 
definition in light of evolving regulation. This may 
lead to changes in our future disclosures. 
Environmental criteria
1. Supports development of sustainable 
technology and markets such as renewable 
energy, environmental goods and services, 
and/or green infrastructure. 
2. Conserves natural resources or biodiversity 
or helps to mitigate against climate change 
(e.g. solutions that encourage or reward 
environmentally responsible behavior). 
3. Protects against environmental risks and 
supports adaptation to climate change 
impacts (e.g. insurance or incentives to 
manage weather-related risks).Social criteria
4. Facilitates activities to tackle social challenges 
and issues faced by socially disadvantaged 
groups (e.g. insurance tailored to social value-
adding products/services that would otherwise 
not be insured). 
5. Specifically tailored solutions for socially 
disadvantaged groups (e.g. products aimed 
at reducing the risk of underserved groups 
by providing otherwise unavailable access 
to finance). 
6. Raises awareness to prevent and mitigate 
challenges faced by socially disadvantaged 
groups1 (e.g. products that include cause-
related marketing or support schemes 
managing weather-related risks). 
1   Our emerging consumer solutions have reached over 9.7 million1 (2020: 10.1 mn) people living on low incomes in Asia, Africa and Latin America with affordable 
microinsurance and micro-savings solutions (see section 02.1.4). Socially disadvantaged groups are defined as populations that are excluded in their local society for 
reasons that may be tied to age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion, economic or other status.01 Introduction

02.2.1 Integrating sustainability 
in proprietary investments
Sustainability integration and 
engagement 
Sustainability integration is fundamental to our 
investment processes to ensure we consider risks 
and opportunities that extend beyond traditional 
investment considerations. Integration of 
sustainability across our proprietary investments is 
steered by Allianz Investment Management (AIM) 
globally across all portfolios, regions and asset 
classes. AIM is the main group-wide investment 
management function for proprietary assets. 
It works closely with Global Sustainability and 
with our internal asset managers, PIMCO and 
Allianz Global Investors (AllianzGI), to develop 
investment-related approaches such as 
the coal phase-out plan and sustainable 
investment strategies. 
We are committed to the Principles for Responsible 
Investment (PRI) and are part of a U.N.-supported 
international network of investors working together 
to promote the incorporation of sustainability into 
investment decision-making. The PRI guide our 
approach to responsible investment and drive 
continuous improvement across our businesses. 
In addition to the disclosures contained in this 
report, we report annually to the PRI as an 
asset owner.1 Due to a change in the timings, the PRI results for 
2021 reporting are due in June 2022. Please see 
our latest PRI assessment results from 2020 in the 
Allianz Sustainability Report 2020.
  Our latest and past PRI Transparency 
Reports can be found on our profile on the 
PRI website.
We have invested more than € 849 billion3 in 
a wide range of asset classes (2020: € 835 bn). 
We systematically integrate sustainability 
considerations across our entire investment 
portfolio2 and enhance and deepen 
our approach, which is comprised of the 
following elements:
1. Asset manager selection, appointment 
and monitoring
As an asset owner committed to the PRI and a 
founding member of the U.N.-convened Net-
Zero Asset Owner Alliance, our position on 
sustainability and our climate ambitions are clear; 
it is critical for the insurance industry to support 
real world decarbonization in line with 1.5°C.
Our portfolio goals cannot be achieved without 
the close collaboration and support of asset 
managers. We select and appoint asset managers 
that align their activities with our long-term 
interest in limiting climate change. To support 
this, we have defined minimum expectations and 
systematic engagement and monitoring practices 
for asset managers. Our sustainability integration approach as an asset owner
This is a simplified visualization of our sustainability integration approach across our proprietary investment  
portfolio and asset classes (illustration not to scale).
1 Allianz SE and Allianz Investment Management SE jointly prepare Allianz’s disclosure to the PRI as an asset owner, while AllianzGI and PIMCO each prepare a 
PRI Report as asset managers.
2 Sustainability integration processes and coverage vary by asset class and between the type of portfolio and mandate. Minimum standards for sustainability 
integration are in place for covering all investments through the Allianz sustainability Functional Rule for Investments.

02.2  Sustainability in proprietary investments
We require all asset managers investing on our 
behalf to integrate sustainability considerations 
into their investment and stewardship processes 
for both public and non-listed assets (see  Table 
ESG-14). Asset managers must meet the minimum 
obligation of being a PRI signatory or having 
their own qualified sustainability, responsible 
investment, and/or ESG policy. More than 99 
percent of our assets are managed by asset 
managers that meet this minimum requirement. 
AIM systematically reviews and evaluates the 
sustainability approaches of external asset 
managers, including their climate change-related 
strategies and decarbonization approach. 
Engagement dialogues focus on governance 
structures to ensure clear responsibilities for 
overseeing sustainability matters, systematic 
monitoring approaches for sustainability risks and 
opportunities, stewardship activities to ensure 
climate ambitions are aligned with our interests, 
and engagement approaches to improve 
sustainability practices in investee companies. 
At the sourcing stage, we require all asset 
managers in the public equity asset class to meet 
the expectations of the U.N. Net-Zero Asset Owner 
Alliance voting expectations document.1 When we 
engage with asset managers that are found to 
lag in one area of their approach but meet our 
overall expectations, we set expectations for 
improvement and we monitor their progress. 
This is an important step towards our goal to 
have a positive real-world impact and proactively 
address climate change. 
2. Systematic integration of sustainability 
factors – sustainability referral and 
assessment process
For non-listed investments such as real estate, 
infrastructure and private equity, we address 
sustainability risks through a detailed referral process. We have published guidelines for ESG 
sensitive business areas (see the Allianz ESG 
Integration Framework sections 03.3 and 03.4). 
ESG screening is mandatory for all transactions 
within these areas. Initial ESG screening is carried 
out by responsible investment professionals within 
the asset management unit.
Detection of a sustainability risk triggers a referral 
process which leads to a detailed assessment 
of the potential risk by Global Sustainability 
and the AIM ESG team. Based on the outcome 
of this assessment, a decision is made whether 
to proceed with a transaction, to proceed 
and require mitigation and management of 
sustainability risks, or to decline a transaction on 
ESG grounds. From time to time, assessments may 
require additional discussion between the asset 
manager, Global Sustainability, the AIM ESG team, 
Group Communications or Group Risk to better 
understand the nuances of the transaction and 
effectively assess the sustainability-related risks. 
In 2021, 71 investment transactions were assessed 
(2020: 65) (see  Tables ESG-1 to 3).
3. Systematic integration of sustainability 
factors – ESG scoring
Our sustainability scoring and engagement 
approach systematically identifies and manages 
risks in our listed proprietary investment portfolio. 
We apply an ESG scoring process to all listed assets 
including sovereign bonds, corporate bonds and 
public equity. The scoring process assesses the 
sustainability performance of individual issuers 
across 35 different key issues (e.g. carbon emissions, 
toxic emissions and waste, labor management, 
business ethics, etc.) using sustainability data 
provided by external data provider, MSCI ESG 
Research. This information is used to consider 
sustainability criteria in investment selection, leading to a more holistic steering of our portfolio 
and targeted management of sustainability risks 
and opportunities. 
We have set a clear sustainability performance 
threshold below which investments are deemed 
‘ESG critical’. The list of issuers in our portfolio 
that score below the threshold is monitored 
by the AIM ESG team. An asset manager with 
investments on this list must ‘comply-or-explain’ 
– meaning either reallocate to another issuer 
or explain and provide reasons for holding these 
issuers. The reasoning and approach taken by the 
asset manager is discussed and assessed during 
regular sustainability deep-dive meetings with asset 
managers. In cases where the reasoning provided is 
not sufficient to address the sustainability concerns, 
the AIM ESG team will ask for an escalation 
approach to be applied to the issuer or will consider 
excluding the issuer from our investable universe.
4. Active engagement 
The role of engagement as an effective and 
meaningful tool to address sustainability concerns 
in investment portfolios has garnered widespread 
acceptance among the investment community. 
Engagement is a cornerstone of active ownership 
as set out by our PRI commitment and it is the 
most direct way to represent our interests to 
companies in our portfolios. 
For Allianz, engaging on sustainability topics 
with our portfolio companies has become an 
expectation of our customers and stakeholders. 
It also makes clear business sense. When the 
companies we invest in emphasize creating value 
for all stakeholders, they are better positioned to 
generate sustainable, long-term business success 
and to deliver better results for our customers, 
whose premiums we invest.

We continue to use our sustainability engagement 
program as an established, consistent way 
to address sustainability issues and support 
sustainable programs among the companies 
in which we invest. It is also an effective way to 
leverage the diversity of employees from business 
functions and geographies to participate in 
the sustainability efforts of Allianz globally. 
Engagements involve the AIM ESG team who 
represent Allianz’s broad interests and colleagues 
from the Allianz entity, which is close to the 
business and responsible for developing our 
expectations and objectives and representing 
them with the company’s management.

02.2  Sustainability in proprietary investments
Our engagement community is evolving as 
the need to magnify real-world impact on 
systemic issues such as climate change places 
new emphasis on investor-led collaborations. 
We have increased our collaborative engagement 
to amplify the positive impact of our efforts. 
Progress in this area is also described below 
under ‘Collaborative and climate engagements’.
Bilateral engagements
We would not contribute to driving positive change 
if we automatically withdrew our investments when 
issues arose rather than engaging in a dialogue to 
address them. That is why proactive engagement is 
integral to our sustainability strategy. 
The AIM Sustainability engagement team 
leads in-depth research using information from 
MSCI ESG Research, other sustainability data 
and intelligence providers and the respective 
corporate disclosures or publications of each 
company. Wherever possible, we involve Allianz 
colleagues that are based in the same country 
or region as the company we are addressing to 
solidify our global and collaborative approach. Questions, requests and expectations related 
to identified sustainability risks or opportunities 
are submitted to the company for a written reply. 
Based on the company’s response and backed-up 
by official company documents, the engagement 
team may conduct further engagement activities 
such as clarifying open points, requesting 
additional disclosures and conducting in-person 
(virtual) meetings with management. We request 
that any commitments the company makes 
to address the sustainability issues raised are 
integrated into their annual reporting or other 
published materials approved by management. 
This level of transparency is an important 
step to formalize commitments and hold the 
company accountable. 
Each engagement is monitored to track 
responsiveness of the company and progress 
against identified sustainability issues. If the 
company shows significant action to improve 
their sustainability risk management and/
or to solve and prevent further sustainability 
issues, the engagement is closed as successful. 
Should a company’s answers continue to prove 
insufficient, show no willingness to improve 
sustainability performance, or fail to respond 
to our engagement communications, our team 
recommends the restriction of all investments 
in the company. This recommendation is 
received and reviewed by the Chairperson of the 
Group Sustainability Board who subsequently 
approves the restriction of the company from all 
proprietary portfolios. In 2021, we opened or continued direct engagement 
discussions with 61 investee companies, based on 
low ESG scoring. 21 of these engagements were 
considered successful and were closed, two were 
closed without success and the remaining 
38 are ongoing or continue to be monitored. 
A comparison versus the previous year can be 
found in  Table ESG-9.
  You can read more about this in our Asset 
management section 02.3. 
Collaborative and climate engagements
Collaborative engagements can take the form of 
multiple investors addressing a single company 
or addressing multiple companies and their 
value chain in a single sector at the same time. 
Collaboration consolidates the efforts for the 
parties involved, allowing for more efficient and 
solution-oriented discussions at a greater level of 
detail. In 2021, we continued to take an active role 
in the Climate Action 100+ initiative by co-leading 
engagements (see section 02.2.3).5. Active ownership 
Voting rights are exercised by AllianzGI on the 
Allianz Group’s behalf. Details on the AllianzGI’s 
voting policy and voting records can be 
found online.1
  You can find Proxy Voting Records on the 
AllianzGI ESG web page.
  Further information on AllianzGI’s proxy 
voting activities can be found in section 02.3.
6. Excluding certain sectors, companies 
and sovereigns
Our exclusion approach covers multiple aspects 
with exclusion lists updated annually based 
on data from external service providers and 
inhouse research.
1. Exclusion and restriction of certain sectors, 
such as companies producing or associated 
with controversial weapons2 and companies 
involved in coal and oil sand-based businesses.
2. Restriction of investments in sovereign 
bonds from countries associated with severe 
human rights violations and significant issues 
managing sustainability concerns.
3. Exclusion and restriction of issuers as a result of 
the scoring and engagement process. 
1 Please note that this reporting covers Allianz’s proprietary insurance assets as well as assets from third-party clients on whose behalf AllianzGI exercises voting rights.

02.2.2 Sustainable investments
Our strategy for sustainable investments 
provides capital for financing the transition 
to a low-carbon economy. We actively 
pursue investment opportunities that 
support solutions to environmental and 
societal challenges, aligned with the U.N. 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), 
and facilitate the timely transition to a 
net-zero world. 
In 2021, we reviewed our definition of sustainable 
investments to follow the rules set by E.U. Sustainable 
Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) Article 
2(17). These define sustainable investments as 
investments in economic activities that contribute 
to environmental and/or social objectives provided that such investments do not significantly harm any of 
those objectives and that good governance practices 
are respected. 
Under our revised definition, all investments 
labeled as sustainable have to comply with all of 
the following three criteria: 
1. Positive contribution to an environmental and/
or social objective;
2. Do no significant harm; and
3. Follow good governance practices.
With respect to the three criteria, we have 
developed an assessment approach to identify 
sustainable investments across a range of asset 
classes. Our assessment is data-driven and based 
on best available data from internationally 
recognized data aggregators and our own 
judgement, where applicable. We will periodically review our assessment approach and data 
sources to develop a best-in-class sustainable 
investments framework.
Sustainable investments asset classes: 
• Sustainable corporates and other (including 
Green, Social and Sustainability Bonds)
• Sustainable sovereigns (including Green, 
Social and Sustainability Bonds)
• Renewables
• Green buildings 
Sustainable investments assessment approach:

1 Non-sustainable business activities include but are not limited to revenues generated from adult entertainment, alcohol, weapons, fossil fuels, tobacco, gambling etc. 
A zero tolerance approach is applied for companies generating revenues from these activities. Green bonds are exempted from fossil fuel activity screening due to climate 
friendly use of proceeds of these bonds.

02.2  Sustainability in proprietary investments
Exploring the difference between sustainable investments  
and EU Taxonomy regulations.
Sustainable investments definition by the 
Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) 
is principle based; qualifying investments shall 
have an environmental or social objective, do no 
significant harm to any of those objectives and 
have good governance practices. Based on these 
principles and with respect to the detailed and 
still evolving framework set by the EU Taxonomy, 
which is amending the SFDR, we developed 
our own conservatively calibrated approach 
covering our main asset classes and all regions 
globally. Through this approach, we identify 
around 15 percent of our portfolio as sustainable 
investments, in line with the EU regulation.
The EU Taxonomy is a tool to help investors 
understand whether an economic activity is 
environmentally sustainable and to navigate the 
transition to a low-carbon economy. It follows 
roughly the same structure as sustainable 
investment regulation (e.g., objective, do no 
significant harm and social safeguarding) 
but it is very detailed and not principle based. 
The Taxonomy defines qualifying criteria on 
a single business activity level. Only climate 
adaptation and mitigation objectives are 
currently in-scope objectives, with more 
environmental and social objectives to come 
in the next years. 
The data reporting universe for the EU 
Taxonomy is regulated by the Non-Financial 
Reporting Directive (NFRD), covering only 
investments into European companies with 
activities which are in scope of the EU Taxonomy 
and assets where we are in a control position, 
meaning in simplified terms that we are an 
equity investor and fully consolidate the assets 
on our balance sheet.As Allianz is pre-dominantly a debt investor 
with a globally diversified portfolio, large parts 
of our assets fall outside the application of the 
EU Taxonomy. For example, sovereign debt is 
not in scope of the EU Taxonomy. Also direct 
debt financing of renewable projects is 
outside the scope of EU Taxonomy reporting. 
Additionally, regulation foresees reporting 
based only on self-reported data of companies 
rather than estimations so our reporting will 
phase in over time as in-scope companies 
will report for the first time in their full-year 
2022 disclosure. 
As EU Taxonomy alignment criteria are difficult 
to assess and takes time for companies and 
investors to analyze, EU regulation foresees that 
investors will report this year only on Taxonomy 
eligibility and not alignment. This means that 
a business activity is eligible whenever it is 
covered by the Taxonomy. Only the second 
step – assessment of alignment – will reflect 
how climate-friendly a business activity is. 
For example, electricity generation is a business 
activity covered in the Taxonomy and all power 
plants are eligible, but only assessment of 
alignment distinguishes between coal power 
plants and renewables – and this assessment 
will not take place until 2022.
The Taxonomy eligible assets for the actual 
reporting period therefore only contain assets 
where we are in a control position – namely 
part of our Real Estate portfolio and equity 
investments into renewables – as well as our 
exposure to mortgages.
Taxonomy-eligible investments in 2021 
totaled € 76.9 billion.Investing in a net-zero economy 
We have a growing global portfolio of climate 
solutions including investing in renewable 
energy, energy innovations and fostering the 
transition to a net-zero economy. Examples 
include investments in the AllianzGI Renewable 
Energy Fund and financing measures that reduce 
energy consumption, resource use and GHG 
emissions. We are committed to increasing our 
exposure in renewables by 5.85 percent per year 
in line with the International Renewable Energy 
Agency projections. 
Investing in emerging economies
For the achievement of a global net-zero 
economy, it is pivotal to close the large financing 
gap prevailing in emerging economies. 
We actively pursue investment opportunities in 
these markets alongside development finance 
institutions, donors and other impact investors. 
Utilizing blended finance structures allows us 
to access new markets and tap into growth 
opportunities, such as for example our funding to 
innovative SMEs and start-ups in Africa through 
Allianz Global Investor’s AfricaGrow fund of funds. 
Another example includes our investment into 
responsAbility’s Global Climate Partnership Fund, 
which fosters energy efficiency and renewable 
energy investments for SMEs and private 
households in emerging countries and thus 
contributes to the reduction of GHG emissions. 
Through GAWA Capital’s Huruma Fund we also 
support improving the access to financing for 
small or excluded farmers in rural areas of Latin 
America, the Caribbean, sub-Saharan Africa and 
Asia, thereby helping to improve the quality of life 
of farmers in the target regions. By investing in the Allianz Impact Investment Fund, 
which is managed by AllianzGI, we further promote 
the generation of measurable environmental and 
/ or social impacts in Europe through investments 
in private debt and equity opportunities across a 
range of sectors such as for example energy supply 
and energy efficiency as well as health and care.01 Introduction

02.2.3 Climate change 
and decarbonization
The financial sector has a crucial role 
to play in enabling a low-carbon future. 
As asset owners, we are uniquely 
positioned to help shape the global 
economy and financial systems. 
This includes driving the decarbonization 
of investment portfolios and supporting 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions 
in the real economy.
We strategically consider climate criteria in all our 
business lines. Our long-term commitment is to 
achieve net-zero GHG emissions in our proprietary 
investment portfolio by 2050, in line with the 
Target-Setting Protocol of the U.N.-convened 
Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (AOA). This means 
that, as asset owners, we will assist, incentivize 
and require our portfolio companies to embark 
on decarbonization pathways consistent with the 
1.5°C objective of the Paris Agreement. As our 
portfolio companies progress towards low-carbon 
business models, we will automatically see our 
portfolio decarbonize.
We use leading academic climate scenarios 
like the ones used for the reports by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) to determine alignment with our goal. 
Targets are based on scenarios which foresee swift 
emission reductions and project that the 1.5°C 
goal is not, or is only slightly, overshot. They do 
not backload emissions reductions by assuming 
the world can massively remove carbon from 
the atmosphere using technologies currently 
unavailable or unproven at scale. Allianz has set an intermediary target to reduce 
GHG emissions by 25 percent by year-end 2024 
compared to a 2019 baseline for its equity and 
tradeable corporate bonds portfolio. In addition 
to traditional investment criteria, we assess 
whether equities and corporate bonds are in 
line with a 1.5°C pathway. In 2021, Allianz has 
reached the -25 percent decarbonization target 
of its equity and corporate bonds portfolio. 
Target achievement was supported by estimated 
four to five percent from COVID-19 shutdowns 
and estimated three percent from positive market 
developments. The normalized emission reduction 
in 2021 is estimated at 16 percent and driven by 
active portfolio measures and emission reduction 
of investee companies. We also target that our 
direct real estate portfolio will be aligned with 
science-based 1.5°C pathways by year-end 2024. 
Furthermore, in 2021 we have introduced 
new targets for our equity and debt 
infrastructure investments. 
These targets foresee: 
• Full transparency on financed emissions latest 
by year-end 2023 for all investments. 
• For direct equity investments an absolute 
carbon reduction of 28 percent by year-
end 2025. 
• New direct (equity and debt) investments 
in high emitting assets only in case a 1.5°C 
aligned decarbonization plan is in place.
• Phase in of net-zero targets for new fund 
investments until year-end 2024. 
These portfolios make up around 36 percent 
of the global Allianz portfolio. For other asset 
classes, the AOA is working to define methods 
on how to measure climate change-related 01 Introduction

Allianz is working with the U.N.-convened Net-
Zero AOA to finalize the methods for sovereign 
bonds as next asset class. We will set targets 
for this asset class within 12 months after the 
recommended methodology is released by 
the AOA.
Engagement at the industry level
To support the shift towards a low-carbon 
economy, we are also active at the industry sector 
level. Our interim targets for year-end 2024 
focus on two of the highest emitting-industries: 
Utilities, and Oil and Gas:
Utilities: Complementing our coal phase-
out commitment by gradually increasing our 
investments in renewables and following at least 
the necessary annual growth rate of 5.85 percent 
as proposed by the International Renewable 
Energy Agency (IRENA). 
Oil and Gas: Supporting the commitment set out 
by the industry-led Oil and Gas Climate Initiative 
(OGCI) to limit the emissions intensity for Scope 1 
and 2 emissions of companies in their exploration 
and production business (‘upstream’) to less than 
20 kg CO 2e per barrel of oil and aligning our Oil 
and Gas exposure on average listed equity and 
corporate bonds portfolio to this intensity level. 
Engaging with companies to set net-zero targets 
on Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050. By 2025, 
we aim for at least 50 percent of our assets under 
management in the oil and gas sector to have set 
these targets. Similar to our own Scope 3 targets, 
the oil and gas industry also has a responsibility to 
reduce their Scope 3 emissions, which mainly are 
the emissions resulting from the burning of oil and gas downstream. Most of oil and gas companies 
have not yet set Scope 3 targets making it 
difficult to track progress. We are reviewing our 
approach to engaging companies around Scope 
3 emissions.
We also aim to increase our bilateral engagement 
activities by at least 100 percent by end of 2024. 
In addition we will increase our participations in 
collaborative engagements such as CA100+ and 
will drive sector and asset manager engagements 
activities as part of the AOA.
In 2021, Allianz released an update of its policy 
on coal-based business models which defined 
in particular even more ambitious thresholds 
from 2023 and a clear pathway to further reduce 
thresholds in the future. In order to smooth the 
transition to these stricter pathways, issuers which 
are expected to potentially breach the new 
thresholds from 2023 were put on Freeze, which 
means, no exposure increase is allowed. This Freeze 
affected € 0.2 billion public equity and € 3.4 billion 
fixed-income exposure. Given this extensive Freeze, 
there are no additional divestments reported 
for 2021.

footprint, see our Climate-related financial

…by driving net-zero emissions with the U.N.-convened 
Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance
By the end of 2021, the U.N.-convened Net-
Zero AOA had grown to include 61 asset 
owners from around the globe, representing 
assets under management of over 10 trillion 
U.S. dollars. New members that joined during 
the year include Nippon Life Insurance 
Company, Sumitomo Life Insurance, African 
Risk Capacity, Sparkassen Versicherung and 
Pensioenfonds Detailhandel, among others. 
The insurance associations of France, Germany 
and Switzerland also became supporters to 
encourage members to join and to support 
them in this process.
Members of the Alliance commit to set 
intermediary decarbonization targets every 
five years for their portfolios. 50 percent of 
members have set a 2025 science-based 
target based on the Alliance’s Protocol with 
the remaining 50 percent due to set targets 
in 2022. This is unparalleled anywhere in the 
private sector and is captured in the Alliance’s 
first public report on progress, published in 
October.1 Allianz has set an intermediary target 
of reducing GHG emissions by 25 percent by the 
end of 2024 compared to 2019. 
The Alliance is driving the availability of 
operationalizable scenarios and pathways by being fully science-based in all that it does 
and by promoting the OECM model and the 
P1-P3 IPCC scenarios, no or low over-shoot. 
Beyond guiding and helping members to 
set targets, the initiative also helps members 
achieve targets through a variety of outputs 
such as Alliance Positions on Thermal Coal, 
Blended Finance, Carbon Pricing and Negative 
Emissions Technologies (NETs).
To achieve meaningful impact, members’ 
portfolio transition to net-zero should primarily 
lead to emission reductions in the companies 
in which they invest, in and not only in portfolios. 
To this end, members are engaging with portfolio 
companies and asset managers, directly and 
through concerted sector roundtables, and 
with governments and public policies. In 2021, 
the Alliance published position papers on 
governmental carbon pricing as well as on the 
role of atmospheric carbon removal in achieving 
net-zero emissions. 
The Alliance published its first report on 
progress in October 2021.

…as a member of Climate 
Action 100+
Allianz is an active member of Climate Action 
100+ (CA100+) which aims to engage with 
167 of the world’s largest corporate GHG 
emitters to set GHG emission reduction 
targets, strengthen climate-related financial 
disclosures and improve governance on 
climate change. 
More than 600 investors, both asset owners 
and asset managers have now signed up to 
the initiative – representing over 60 trillion U.S. 
dollars in assets under management. Allianz 
is a lead engager on two of the CA100+ 
target companies and we collaborate on 
a further three. Our effort has included 
introducing the CA100+ Net-Zero Company 
Benchmark to the companies we engage with 
and supporting the initiative’s broader role 
out of this measurement and tracking tool. 
The Benchmark covers critical indicators to 
measure company progress against a 1.5°C 
aligned pathway, and to transparently report 
on their progress. 
We have seen a significant increase in 
commitments from many CA100+ companies 
and we continue to support cooperative 
dialogues with target companies in pursuit 
of increased climate ambition, transparency, 
governance and reporting.01 Introduction

02.2.4 Sustainability in real 
estate investments
We are working to reduce the GHG 
emissions of our portfolio to net-zero 
by 2050 by embedding sustainability 
criteria and collaborating with others 
to strengthen sustainability activities 
across real estate management 
and investment. 
Allianz Real Estate develops and executes 
tailored portfolios and investment strategies for 
Allianz insurance companies and pension funds 
around the world, as well as for third-party clients. 
In 2021, Allianz Real Estate and other Allianz 
operating entities invested proprietary assets 
totaling € 6.4 billion (2020: € 5.6 bn) in green 
buildings, including equity and debt investments. 
This equals a share of 11 percent of our total real 
estate portfolio of € 59.5 billion.
With the increasing focus on decarbonization, 
real estate assets face significant costs in 
meeting higher energy efficiency standards and 
addressing demands from investors and tenants. 
Real estate is also highly exposed to physical 
climate risks and large-scale investment may 
be required to improve resilience – for example 
through relocation of critical equipment to 
reduce potential flood damage or upgrading air 
conditioning systems to ensure reliability during 
extreme heat events. Embedding sustainability in real estate
Allianz Real Estate’s ESG integration framework 
is designed to improve the sustainability 
performance and transparency of real estate 
assets and address issues such as physical 
climate risks, reducing the risks of obsolescence 
and depreciation. 
Our framework is based on three key areas of 
activity: assess, engage and improve.
1.  Assess 
Screening assets for sustainability issues is an 
integral part of our decision-making process. 
Our primary focus is on carbon emissions 
and energy efficiency and we also look 
at governance and social and well-being 
standards. Any equity investment must have 
an environmental or sustainability certification 
(e.g. BREEAM or LEED).
2.  Engage 
We aim to influence our partners and tenants 
to follow our lead and take an active role to 
bring about change, for example by promoting 
‘green leases’ which include provisions 
designed to reduce environmental impacts. 
3.  Improve 
Key to improving our portfolio is the 
decarbonization of our direct investments 
which equate to half of our investment 
portfolio. By improving the energy efficiency 
and replacing traditional energy sources with 
low-carbon alternatives we are transforming 
our buildings for the future.  For more detail on Allianz Real Estate’s 
ESG integration approach, see the Allianz 
Real Estate website and the Allianz ESG 
Integration Framework.
Decarbonizing our real estate portfolio
In 2021, we further embedded our sustainability 
approach in the European Debt business by 
increasing analysis and benchmarking of energy 
and carbon-related data during technical due 
diligence and energy performance data collection 
during the term of the loan. We also amended 
the environmental due diligence scope of work 
for direct investments to consider decarbonization 
and required actions and investments in 
more detail. 
We are working to reduce the GHG emissions of 
our real estate portfolio to net-zero by 2050 in line 
with our Group commitment. 
Our aim is to align with the 1.5°C decarbonization 
pathways for the global real estate sector 
published by the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor 
(CRREM). This translates into a 25 percent carbon 
emission reduction target for the global portfolio 
by 20251.To meet our targets, we are working to address 
challenges posed by a lack of industry-wide 
standards and availability of high-quality data 
by providing detailed guidance and instructions 
for our external partners and embracing new 
technologies such as smart meters to inform 
sustainability data-based decision-making. 
With the scope of our ambition including 
operational emissions from areas not under our 
direct control, such as tenant areas, achieving it 
will require significant engagement and 
collaboration. It is a challenge to implement KPIs 
and disclose progress on decarbonization efforts 
as appropriate evidence and robust controls 
cannot easily be implemented to meet highest 
assurance requirements.
Among others, new acquisitions will be assessed 
against 1.5°C GHG and energy pathways and the 
investment needed to meet related targets will 
be considered. Procurement of renewable energy 
and engagement to convince tenants to switch to 
green electricity will be a priority (e.g. via standard 
lease agreements). Where deep refurbishments 
are required, completed buildings will be highly 
energy efficient to ensure long-term compliance 
with the 1.5°C GHG pathway.

Integration of sustainability 
in asset management is 
an important industry 
driver. As active investors 
with leading research 
capabilities, our investment 
management businesses 
innovate sustainable 
investment solutions.
Allianz Group’s asset management segment offers 
an increasing number of ESG and responsible 
investment solutions. Our two major investment 
businesses – Allianz Global Investors (AllianzGI) 
and PIMCO – cater to a wide range of investors 
with bespoke ESG integration needs, from retail 
fund investors to institutional clients.
As a diversified multi asset player AllianzGI is 
a global leader in active asset management 
managing € 456 billion in third party assets of 
which € 184.3 billion are ESG themed investments 
or 40% (in 2020: € 95.4 bn or 25.5 percent of total AuM). PIMCO is a premium fixed income player 
managing € 1.5 trillion in 3rd party assets of 
which 203.1 billion are ESG themed investments 
or 13.4 % (in 2020: € 136.5 bn or 10.2 percent of 
total AuM).
Embedding active investment 
management 
Our asset managers take an active stewardship 
role to maximize the sustainability value of client’s 
capital. Material ESG factors are important 
considerations while evaluating long-term 
investment opportunities and risks for all asset 
classes in public and private markets.
AllianzGI’s strategic approach
AllianzGI continues to grow its sustainability 
offering demonstrating its commitment as an 
active investor to shaping the world of tomorrow. 
Since joining the company at the beginning of 
2021, the Global Head of Sustainable and Impact 
Investing, has set out to accelerate the growth of 
Impact investing as part of a fast-growing private 
markets offering and continued integration of ESG 
in AllianzGI’s public and private market offerings. To support this journey, there have been a number 
of significant changes to the company:
• A newly created centralized Sustainable 
Investment Office responsible for shaping 
sustainable product strategy and 
sustainable policies. 
• A Sustainability Methodologies and Analytics 
team was set up to oversee AllianzGI’s ESG 
integration efforts, further develop ESG data 
sets and leverage state-of-the-art-technology.
• Sustainability Research and Stewardship teams 
have been refocused on developing thematic 
research and engagement.
• Announcement of an Impact Measurement 
and Management team to develop an impact 
framework for due diligence, measurement 
and management of private market 
Impact investments. 
All of the assets managed by AllianzGI are 
ESG risk assessed whereby sustainability risks 
are identified and monitored throughout the 
management of the portfolios. The firm’s 
specific ESG approaches, which include its two 
sustainability strategies (sustainability-focused 
and impact-focused), are defined in the following 
way and have been developed based on clients’ 
preferred outcomes whether it be risk mitigation 
through to measurable impact:
1. ESG risk-focused strategies – integrate 
material ESG risk considerations into 
investment analysis and decisions without 
constraining the investment universe.
2. Sustainability-focused strategies – consider 
sustainability objectives and values as part 
of their portfolio construction, in addition to 
financial returns. 
3. Impact-focused strategies – consider 
measurable sustainable outcomes and 02.3 Sustainability in asset management

its approach.
PIMCO’s strategic approach
PIMCO has a long history of managing socially 
responsible portfolios for clients and has invested 
in talent, technology, infrastructure and solutions 
to position itself as a leader in ESG Fixed Income. 
Over the last year, PIMCO added resources to its 
broader ESG team and expertise including:
• A Global Head of Sustainability who will 
oversee PIMCO’s ESG and Sustainability 
initiatives, providing strategic direction, 
governance and firm wide coordination of 
ESG efforts. 
• Eight dedicated ESG analysts to help identify 
opportunities and risks associated with ESG 
related topics.
• Collaboration with external experts such 
as Mark Carney, who became a member of 
PIMCO’s Global Advisory Board in 2020. 
PIMCO evaluates ESG risk factors from a top 
down (i.e. macro) and a bottom-up (i.e. issuer 
and security specific) perspective. Its first step is 
to identify the major long-term themes that will 
affect the global economy and financial markets. 
The firm’s annual Secular Forums are devoted to 
identifying and analyzing these trends. This year’s 
forum identified the transition to green energy 
as one of the three major trends over the secular 
horizon. PIMCO blends its macro analysis with 
bottom-up work carried out by the firm’s global 
research teams and portfolio managers who 
evaluate ESG-related issues as part of their 
analysis processes.01 Introduction

For investors seeking greater ESG orientation 
in their portfolios, PIMCO offers a suite of ESG-
dedicated solutions. In 2021, PIMCO enhanced 
its ESG research frameworks and capabilities, 
particularly for municipal bonds and securitized 
assets. The platform builds on PIMCO’s core 
ESG process and sustainability-specific features 
focused in three areas: exclusions, evaluation, 
and engagement.
Engagement and stewardship
Our asset managers engage proactively 
with investee companies to build sustainable 
businesses. They engage in regular dialogue 
and seek to present a viewpoint, effect positive 
change and monitor results of engagement. 
By investing in corporates willing to improve 
their ESG practices, we believe we can drive 
greater change than through exclusions alone. 
Our goal is both to find the best opportunities in 
the market and also to create them by engaging 
with issuers. Our investment views are influenced by the outcomes of engagements and are linked 
to the proxy voting process to form a consistent 
stewardship approach.
With 299 company engagements covering 
482 topics in 238 companies and 27 markets, 
AllianzGI showcased its strong commitment 
to engagement in 2021 and voted at 10,190 
shareholder meetings. In 68 percent of meetings 
they voted against management, withheld or 
abstained with at least one vote. These figures 
reflect AllianzGI’s willingness to vote against 
proposals that do not meet its expectations as 
well as fulfilling its duty to act in the interests of 
clients by considering each proposal on merit.
  Read more in AllianzGI’s 
stewardship statement.
PIMCO’s 80+ global credit research team engaged 
with 1,585 corporate bond issuers representing 
roughly 80 percent of PIMCO’s corporate holdings 
by market value. Topics of discussion with company 
management related to corporate strategy, leverage and balance sheet management 
as well as ESG-related topics such as climate 
change targets and ESG bonds, human capital 
management, and board qualifications and 
composition. Of the 1,585 corporate bond issuers 
engaged, more than 650 issuers were engaged 
in depth, with repeat discussions on specific 
topics and milestones monitored and tracked. 
These issuers represent almost 60 percent of the 
firm’s corporate holdings by market value.
 Read more in PIMCO’s ESG Investment report. 
Climate engagement
Our asset managers have developed robust 
methods to incorporate climate considerations 
into our investment decisions and processes. 
Supporting the companies we invest in to develop 
their transition pathways is one of the ways with 
which we broaden our positive impact.
Last year, AllianzGI introduced a specific element 
of climate engagement related to its ‘Climate 
Engagement with Outcome’ program. Under 
the program, in portfolios applying the program 
the highest emitters are identified, their climate 
profiles are fully scoped, and it seeks to engage 
with these companies to understand their climate 
transition pathway towards a Paris Agreement 
aligned economy. It will actively engage with the 
highest emitters (Scopes 1 and 2) on ambitious 
climate ‘outcomes’ encompassing not only scale 
of decarbonization, but also how this is being 
achieved (and aligned with Just Transition). 
These targets are considered within the context 
of sector and peers to ensure both credibility and 
ambition. The approach combines this with the 
firm’s Sustainability Minimum Exclusions.AllianzGI also continues to support global net-
zero ambitions via its Private Markets platform. 
In November, together with IFC and Hong Kong 
Monetary Authority, AllianzGI set up the world’s 
first cross-sectoral portfolio of emerging-market 
loans aligned with the Paris Agreement called the 
Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Program (MCPP 
One Planet). The strategy supports the IFC and 
Allianz Group to make 1.5°C-aligned investments 
in emerging markets. AllianzGI also announced at 
the U.N. Climate Conference in Glasgow the launch 
of the Emerging Market Climate Action strategy 
(EMCA), a public-private partnership, which will 
invest in climate-focused private equity funds and 
projects active in emerging markets and developing 
countries with a focus on climate mitigation, 
climate adaptation, and access to electricity.
AllianzGI has also enhanced its company-wide 
exclusions policy, including a dedicated coal 
policy for the first time. This enhanced exclusion 
policy effective from December 2021, further 
underlines AllianzGI’s commitment to tackling 
climate change by divesting from the single 
largest source of carbon emissions – coal.

PIMCO’s broad climate research evaluates 
climate-related risks and opportunities within 
specific sectors and issuers, typically beginning 
with two broad categories:
1. Transition risks: for example tighter 
regulations on carbon emissions.
2. Physical risks: for example how the rising 
intensity and frequency of extreme weather 
events affects critical assets and natural 
resources used or relied upon by the issuer.02.3  Sustainability in asset management

PIMCO has developed a range of methodologies 
to help investors assess climate risks and climate 
impacts in their portfolio. For sustainability 
portfolio solutions, the insights these tools provide 
include material information to support portfolio 
managers in better managing and mitigating 
climate-related credit risks. They enable them to 
assess a portfolio’s alignment with targets from 
the Paris Agreement to limit global temperature 
rise to 1.5°C to 2°C above preindustrial levels.
Collaborating with industry groups
AllianzGI and PIMCO take an active role in 
dialogue with industry and market initiatives. 
As a member of the Net-Zero Asset Managers 
Initiative, AllianzGI is committed to supporting 
the goal of net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 
or sooner. In October, AllianzGI joined the 
One Planet Asset Managers Initiative which 
supports members of the One Planet Sovereign 
Wealth Funds (OPSWF) to integrate climate-
related risks and opportunities within long-term 
investment portfolios. AllianzGI also supports 
AIM in its role as a member of the Platform for 
Sustainable Finance. 
PIMCO focuses on established engagement 
platforms to drive positive change in capital 
markets. In 2021, it became a member of the 
Sustainable Markets Initiative and an Advisory 
Board member of the Sustainable Bond 
Network (NASDAQ). Co-founded by PIMCO in 
partnership with the UNGC and energy utility 
Enel, the CFO Taskforce is co-chaired by Scott 
Mather, PIMCO’s Chief Investment Officer U.S. 
Core and Sustainable Investments. The taskforce 
aims to engage global CFOs on sustainable 
development, leveraging the nearly 10,000 
companies participating in the UNGC. PIMCO also participates on the Executive Committee of 
International Capital Markets Association (ICMA) 
which oversees impact bond principles/guidelines 
and endorses the TCFD; the CDP, Climate Action 
100+ and major global platforms including the 
IIGCC Net-Zero Investment initiative where PIMCO 
co-authored the Net-Zero Investment Framework 
Implementation Guide.
Client communication and engagement
Our ability to bring value to our clients goes 
beyond just delivering on stated investment 
outcomes. Client service and communication 
is an integral component of the investment 
management service that our asset 
managers provide. 
As a matter of course the development of 
the ongoing proceedings in connection with 
the Allianz GI US LLC Structured Alpha funds 
is monitored. Findings will be reflected in the 
continuous improvement of processes.
Communication with clients is made via all 
forms as defined by regulatory requirements.
In addition, clients are furnished with all forms 
of communication that the firm believes to 
be relevant to the client. The frequency and 
the content of said communications vary, 
depending on the nature of the product and/
or service. 
AllianzGI aims to provide transparency by 
always at least meeting the regulatorily required 
standard. It has policies and procedures in place 
to ensure the content of communication to 
investors is reliable.

clients. This means going beyond understanding 
investment portfolio objectives, risks and 
constraints by working with clients to understand 
the investment objectives of their entire plan and 
how their objectives might best be achieved. 
PIMCO performs a range of client services to 
promote collaboration and engagement: 
• Separate client service and portfolio 
management functions focus on delivering 
higher levels of service and performance 
to clients. 
• One or more account managers are assigned 
to each client. They aim to meet with clients 
at least twice yearly and are available to 
respond to client requests as well as providing 
customized educational sessions for clients.
• PIMCO strives to keep clients up-to-date 
through regular reports which may include 
a review of past portfolio strategy and 
performance, discussion of current strategy, 
economic outlook and market forecast. 
• In addition to robust in-person client servicing 
and substantial web resources, PIMCO offers 
clients the opportunity to build their investment 
knowledge through seminars and conferences. 
PIMCO has implemented policies and procedures 
that are designed to identify, manage, mitigate 
and/or resolve actual or potential conflicts of 
interest including conflicts relating to, among 
other things, portfolio management and trading practices, personal investment transactions, 
gifts and entertainment, proxy voting and 
other matters.
Both AllianzGI and PIMCO have received 
excellent PRI ratings for consecutive 
years in a row1

of the Year’
– this title was awarded to AllianzGI 
Infrastructure Debt team at the IJGlobal 
Award, recognizing the attention they place on 
sustainability and active engagement on critical 
ESG factors. 
Sustainable asset 
management solutions

the ESG and Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) 
products and strategies offered to third-party 
asset management clients (see section 02.3).
Examples include:
• Pension funds that make it possible to invest 
in sustainable funds following specific ESG 
sustainability criteria;

rating resultsWe are committed to integrating sustainability across our organization. In the 
following part of the ‘Measuring and managing sustainability’ section of this 
report, we focus on topics which we can quantify and then give an overview of 
the key approaches.
For our human resources activities, we have set quantitative targets for our Board 
of Management to employee engagement (IMIX and WWi+) and we measure 
our leaders’ performance against the Allianz People Attributes. Furthermore, 
we have publicly committed to a set of diversity and inclusion targets.
To ensure customers are always put first, the targets of our Board of Management 
include a focus on customer loyalty, as measured through the net promoter 
score (NPS).
As a global company, we have also committed to reducing our environmental 
footprint. For this we have set a board-level target regarding our organization’s 
GHG emissions reduction (30 percent based on 2019 by 2025) as well as our 
use of renewable electricity (100 percent by end of 2023). In addition to these, 
there are also targets to reduce our environmental footprint across other 
dimensions (such as water and waste). 
For all areas, we have a long-standing set of indicators to disclose our 
sustainability performance across our organization. Furthermore, this section 
describes management approaches to integrate sustainability in these matters.
  The performance of our Board of Management regarding their 
sustainability targets is on track. For a detailed overview, please see 
sections 01.3. An overview of all further quantitative and qualitative 
targets and our performance related to these topics can be found in 
section 05.1.

02.4 Human resources
Building confidence in 
tomorrow must start with 
148,7081 employees who are 
part of our diverse global 
workforce. Allianz fosters 
a culture and working 
environment where people 
and performance matter and 
where everyone has a voice. 
We take a strong stance 
regarding gender equality, 
diversity and inclusion (D&I), 
training and development, 
and employee engagement. 
The health, safety and well-
being of our employees is of 
utmost importance. 
Our purpose, ‘We secure your future’ reminds 
us why we exist as a company: to secure our 
customers’ future and give them confidence 
in tomorrow. This purpose anchors the Group 
strategy, employee value proposition, brand 
promise and customer experience principles and 
drives our decisions and actions. We held our 
second global Purpose and Strategy Day in the 
autumn of 2021 to engage our employees in our purpose, reaching over 50 operating entities 
and 137,000 participating employees. Events 
sought to include real customer voices through 
stories, podcasts and panel discussions to have 
a positive impact on employee engagement and 
customer centricity.
Inclusive Meritocracy – a culture where 
people and performance matter 
Inclusive Meritocracy is the term we use to 
describe a culture and working environment 
where people and performance matter. It was 
developed under the umbrella of the Renewal 
Agenda in 2015 and resulted in the creation of 
a key index in the Allianz Engagement Survey, 
the Inclusive Meritocracy Index (IMIX). 
Inclusive Meritocracy describes a corporate 
culture of mutual trust and respect, empowerment 
and collaboration where diversity is appreciated 
and customer satisfaction is a high priority. 
Performance has an impact on rewards and 
is encouraged by clear two-way leadership 
communication. The IMIX measures the 
progress we are making in embedding Inclusive 
Meritocracy. It looks across ten aspects covering 
leadership, performance and corporate 
culture. Performance against employee 
engagement targets is among the sustainability 
factors considered as part of the variable 
component of Board member’s remuneration 
(see section 02.4.3).
  The results of the 2021 IMIX can be found 
along with other results of the AES on 
page 46.Shaping how we work and do business: 
our new Ways of Working (WOW)
In 2021, we introduced more flexible, collaborative 
and agile ways of working that empower 
our employees, customers and organization. 
These new ways of working aim to enhance 
employee engagement, productivity and innovation, resulting in simpler and prompter 
service offerings for our customers, resilience from 
the impacts of future crises and a faster and 
flatter organization. COVID-19 required us to 
respond rapidly to unexpected situations and new 
priorities. The challenges increased the pace of 
change with respect to how we work together and 
engage with each other and our stakeholders.

Flexible working 
Our new global WOW standards have been 
designed to provide an environment where our 
employee needs are taken care of. Flexible work 
comes in different forms and we have learned 
that hybrid teams help us build a more resilient 
organization. This will become our new normal. 
Employees are offered the opportunity to spend 
a minimum of 40 percent of time working from 
home depending on their position e.g. mobile 
worker, office worker etc. The shift has also 
significantly reduced business travel compared 
to 2019.
With the introduction of cross-border remote 
work guidelines, our mobile work policy standard 
allows employees to work up to 25 days a year 
abroad in accordance with local regulations. 
The flexibility of this standard offers the potential 
to enhance the employees’ work-life balance. 
As part of our new WOW, we are enabling our 
teams to collaborate and work remotely by 
investing in technical equipment (e.g. laptop, 
mobile phone, screens, headset etc.) and 
collaboration tools (e.g., global roll-outs of O365). 
In-office meeting spaces will be equipped with 
technology to support hybrid meetings and 
promote an inclusive environment across hybrid 
teams. In addition, new global workspace designs 
promote a culture of collaboration, sharing and 
co-creation.65 % 
employee time was spent working from home 
in RACo1 entities by the end of 4Q 2021.2 
99 % 
employees in RACo entities have been offered 
a technical package to work from home with 
connectivity to the Allianz server by the end 
of 4Q 2021. 
02.4.1 Diversity and inclusion (D&I)
A diverse workforce enables us to 
understand and fulfil the needs of 
our equally diverse customer base. 
We believe in equality of opportunity 
and continue to create an inclusive 
environment to equip our employees 
for the challenges of the future.
D&I are important material issues for Allianz, 
as identified in our 2021 materiality assessment. 
The topic covers commitments and activities to 
create a fair and inclusive working environment 
where everyone can succeed regardless of 
gender identity or expression, age, ability, 
sexual orientation, ethnicity or cultural 
background among others.
Diversity and inclusion strategy 
Our D&I strategy, is built around three pillars: 
employees; customers; and brand and reputation. 
It aims to embed D&I across the whole business, 
helping us to define our priorities and drive our 
D&I ambitions.In 2021, we rolled out two new policies that 
underpin the Allianz Code of Conduct: 
• The Allianz Diversity and Inclusion Policy 
describes our rationale for D&I and how 
we foster diversity in all its forms
• The Allianz Anti-Harassment Policy that 
outlines our global zero tolerance standard 
against sexual and other harassment 
and discrimination.
Our commitment to D&I comes from our top 
management. More than 20 CEOs and Board 
Members from Allianz entities around the globe 
are part of the Global Inclusion Council which 
has been in place since 2007. It oversees the 
implementation of our D&I strategy. 
We engage with employees through inclusion 
networks which aim to raise awareness, support 
employees, advocate for change and help shape 
the D&I agenda. They bring together colleagues 
who share an identity or experience and their 
friends and allies. At the global level, three new 
global networks were established in 2021 
bringing the total to five, each focused on a key 
priority for D&I. The number of local employee 
networks grew from 15 to more than 50.

Our target for December 2021 was to have 
30 percent of women on the Allianz SE Board 
of Management and Supervisory Board and 
40 percent women in our talent pools. We are 
proud to have achieved 33.3 percent women 
on the Allianz SE Supervisory Board and 43.4 
percent of women in our talent pools. We have 
27 percent of women on the Allianz SE Board of 
Management as of January 2022, beginning a 
year of transition towards our target of 30 percent 
women which we are confident we will reach. 02.4  Human resources

Allianz applies a Women in Leadership 
forecasting model (based on people analytics) to 
identify hiring needs and thus increase the ratio 
of female executives. We have set new targets 
and ambitions for December 2024 that extend 
beyond gender representation and cover the 
dimensions generations, nationality and ethnicity, 
LGBTQ+ and disability. As accountability is key, 
management has the target to drive development 
for all employees and ensure a robust succession 
pipeline in line with our D&I targets and ambitions. 
  Read more about our D&I targets and 
ambitions on our website.
Fair and transparent reward
We emphasize equality and fairness by ensuring 
the same pay for equal work and work of equal 
value for all employees. Allianz has committed 
to the ambitious goal of achieving equal pay 
globally by the end of 2021.1 To this end, we have 
introduced an annual global pay review and 
best practices to monitor fair pay across the 
organization and prevent equal pay gaps from 
arising in the future. In 2022, we will introduce 
pay equality KPIs in line with the World Economic 
Forum (WEF) requirements.

We continued to receive external recognition 
of our D&I efforts, for example:
• We were listed in the Bloomberg Gender-
Equality Index for the sixth consecutive year; 
• We achieved fifth place in the Global Refinitiv 
Diversity and Inclusion Index, two ranks up 
from 2020; and 
• We were placed second in the 
BeyondGenderAgenda German Diversity 
Index (ranking the DAX30 companies). 
In 2021, we embarked on the EDGE (Economic 
Dividends for Gender Equality) certification 
process.2 The process is designed to help us 
measure, monitor and understand how we are 
progressing on gender equality and equal pay 
globally compared to external standards and 
benchmarks. We are now globally EDGE Assess

02.4.2 Training and 
developing our people
Learning and development is a key 
differentiator in the financial services 
industry which is constantly changing 
in response to the evolving external 
context. Companies that develop 
skills for the long term will be best 
prepared to respond to emerging trends 
and opportunities and to attract the 
best talent.
Strategic workforce planning
Understanding what the transition to a digital 
future means for Allianz and its people is a 
strategic priority. Digitalization and automation 
will change the composition of the future 
workforce with some job profiles no longer 
existing, new profiles and capabilities emerging, 
and considerable changes in existing profiles 
and skills. This will require major upskilling and 
reskilling initiatives to prepare the workforce for 
the future. Our main focus will be on developing 
digital, data and agile working skills. Skills like 
IT security, communications and HR will also 
be essential.
Our strategic workforce planning (SWP) approach 
compares workforce supply by job profile against 
projected workforce demand over the next five 
years to prepare our workforce for the future. As of 
2021, strategic workforce planning is a structured 
annual process integrated with the annual 
planning process. 82 %
of the global Allianz workforce covered by the 
SWP program by end of 2021
(2020: 53 percent) 
3,155 FTEs1
recruited and reskilled in strategically relevant 
talent segments in Allianz operating entities 
in 2021 (2021 plan: 2,177). 
We avoid ‘like-for-like’ recruiting and emphasize 
the acquisition of new and relevant strategic skills.
Supporting lifelong learning
We focus on promoting lifelong learning 
through our global #learn initiative and offer 
our employees one hour each week dedicated 
to learning. We employ a wide range of learning 
and development approaches including on-the-
job learning, mentoring and coaching, classroom 
trainings, peer circles and digital/mobile learning. 
Digital opportunities such as LinkedIn Learning 
and our AllianzU Learning Platform (Degreed) are 
available to all employees worldwide. 
We have targeted programs in place for key 
areas such as property and casualty, life and 
health, IT, strategy, finance, communications, 
market management and operations. 
Developing strong leaders
Ensuring our leaders continue to develop their 
leadership skills and mindsets to steer the 
transformation is critical for the success of the 
business and for empowering all employees to 
perform at their best. #lead Ignite is a global program designed to 
equip the next generation of Allianz leaders with 
the knowledge, mindset and skills needed to lead 
in Allianz’s inclusive, meritocratic environment. 
In 2021, the program was completed by 99 
participants, 47 percent of whom were women 
(up from 27 % of 33 participants in 2020) across 
13 operating entities.
#lead Empower is a group-wide program for 
experienced leaders that provides participants 
with development and coaching for their next 
career step to a senior executive role as they 
transition from leading teams to leading leaders 
and the business. In 2021, 34 of our high-potential 
leaders started their #lead Empower journeys, 
of whom 47 percent were women (vs. 39 percent 
in 2020). These leaders represented 15 countries 
and 21 entities. 
The Allianz Leadership Passport 
We launched the Allianz Leadership Passport, 
a #lead program, in June 2020. The passport 
is the license to be a people leader at Allianz. 
Our people leaders follow a continuous learning 
journey consisting of self-led gamified learning 
on the #lead Platform and the #lead Experience, 
an instructor-led virtual classroom. The passport 
covers technology-focused Intelligence Quotient 
(IQ) skills and people-focused Emotional Quotient 
(EQ) skills – from digital leadership to storytelling 
and resilience. After attaining their Leadership 
Passport, leaders complete one hour per week of 
learning to ‘refresh’ their passport. Our target was for 100 percent of leaders to attain 
their Allianz Leadership Passport by the end of 
2021. As of the end of 2021, 11,850 (93 %) leaders 
in scope have attained their #lead Allianz 
Leadership Passport. 12,116 leaders in scope 
completed the digital learning journey on the 
#lead Platform and 12,117 leaders completed 
the #lead Experience virtual classroom. This 
equated to 339,264 hours of leadership training 
since the program launch.
The success of the #lead Allianz Leadership 
Passport will be monitored in three key ways:
Business impact – measured by engagement 
survey progression and increase in learning hours;
Behavioral change – measured via assessment 
tools (Allianz Multi Rater Assessment), 
engagement survey and learning hours; and 
Satisfaction with program – based on the 
Net Promoter Score (NPS) and evaluation 
form outcomes. 
While it is still early to measure the business 
impact and behavioral changes – given that the 
program was launched in June 2020 – people 
analytics has demonstrated that higher #Lead 
coverage goes along with higher employee 
engagement and well-being. In addition, 
the current NPS is 74 and the average quality 
rating is 84 percent.01 Introduction

Performance management 
and transparent feedback 
Performance management and transparent 
feedback ensure progression for our employees 
and Allianz as an organization. Our goal is to 
align individual priorities with Allianz’ strategic 
objectives and set the ideal framework for 
engagement and achievement at work. This way 
our employees are in charge of their goals at any 
time and are able to pursue their personal best 
with a clear vision in mind.
Recognizing that both people and performance 
matter, we invest time and resources in developing 
high performance at all levels. Our global 
performance management approach focuses 
on two key areas: ’What’ (outcome-oriented 
performance) and ‘How’ (behavior). It covers 
nearly 60,000 employees with the goal of covering 
all Allianz’s employees worldwide by the end 
of 2022. Our approach promotes a continuous 
performance and feedback culture that enables 
teams to exchange feedback on a regular 
basis. Feedback is most useful when it’s open, 
honest, constructive and forward-looking to help 
employees discover their potential. Three key 
milestones for performance management 
throughout the year cement this culture: 
initial priority setting, mid-year check-in and 
year-end review. We use Multi Rater as a tool to 
gather multi-dimensional feedback at executive 
levels to gain valuable insights into perceived 
strengths and development needs. In June 2021, 
7,355 employees from 48 operating entities were 
rated and key performance and development 
actions based on the results were discussed at the 
mid-year check-ins. In 2021, we piloted a flexible, 
collaborative and continuous performance tool 
called Continuous Performance Management 
(CPM). The tool was successfully piloted by 
the AZ SE Singapore Branch where it led to 
simpler tracking of activities and more effective 
performance and talent check-ins. More pilots 
will follow in 2022.€ 102.9 mn1

To deliver our purpose, drive long-term 
business success and become a truly 
customer-centric organization, we must 
attract, retain and engage with talented 
candidates and employees around 
the world.
As candidates’ needs and values have changed, 
we have re-positioned Allianz’s employer brand. 
We involved more than 80,000 employees and 
1,200 external candidates in co-creating and 
re-shaping our global employer value proposition 
(EVP), resulting in the tag line ‘We care for 
tomorrow’ The new EVP addresses important 
job choice drivers such as career development, 
sustainability, employee well-being and D&I to 
engage employees and encourage candidates to 
join Allianz. 
The EVP was launched in March 2021 and rolled 
out in all operating entities and on all offline/
online channels by Dec 2021. According to our 
research, 73 percent of Allianz employees say 
they would recommend Allianz as an employer 
to their family/friends and 73 percent of external 
potential candidates would consider joining 
Allianz because of the new EVP.
Within people analytics projects on attrition, 
we study reasons for leaving to develop target 
group oriented measures, improve the candidate 
journey (incl. onboarding activities) and increase 
employee retention.

Aiming for true candidate-centricity
Applying for a job with Allianz has also never 
been easier. In October 2021, we launched a new 
online application tool for internal and external 
job seekers which requires only six fields to be 
filled in to submit an application. We eliminated 
certain application form fields, e.g. salutation, 
and leveraged artificial intelligence when writing 
job descriptions to reduce unconscious bias in the 
recruitment process. Continuing our path of true 
candidate-centricity, we launched an online forum 
on our global career website which connects 
users to Allianz employees where they can ask 
questions to foster transparency. 
Fostering the share ownership culture
Being simpler, faster and better for our customers 
means working together as one Allianz and, 
as such, all our employees should benefit when 
we succeed. The Allianz Employee Share Purchase 
Plan (ESPP) is designed to enable our employees 
to share in the long-term performance of Allianz 
SE on the stock market as shareholders, owners 
and employees. For every 3 Euro invested in 
the share program, Allianz contributes 1 Euro. 
Currently, more than 50 percent of employees 
across 42 countries (2020: 42 countries) are 
Allianz shareholders. In 2021, the Allianz ESPP 
was recognized externally by the Global Equity 
Organization (GEO) winning the award for Best 
Plan Communication. Employee rights
We ensure employee rights are protected 
across all operating entities. Allianz was one 
of the first companies to create pan-European 
worker participation standards and to establish 
a European SE Works Council under the 
legislation for Societas Europaea (SE) companies. 
Local employee representation is widespread 
across Europe. The Allianz SE holding company 
has a supervisory board made up of 50 percent 
employee representatives. 
Social dialogue 2.0 
We engage closely with employee representatives 
to support change implementation, manage 
impacts on employees and promote opportunities. 
Social dialogue 2.0 is our pan-European forum 
which has existed for over a decade. It supports 
the progress of the Renewal Agenda and our 
response to the increased pace of change of 
topics such as the digital revolution. The outcomes 
of the discussions in 2021 included among others 
the signing of the Equal opportunities, Diversity, 
and Inclusion Agreement.The Allianz Engagement Survey 2021
The Allianz Engagement Survey (AES) is our 
formal employee platform for gathering 
employee feedback and promoting a high-
performance culture. In 2021, 132,126 employees 
(2020: 132,593) from 64 entities (2020: 67) 
worldwide were invited to take part in AES.1 
The response rate of 82 percent (2020: 85 %) is 
considered very high among large, multi-national 
organizations which typically reach 70 percent to 
80 percent. This reflects the continued interest of 
our employees in having their say on the future 
development of Allianz. 
The 2021 results of AES were the second best 
result in Allianz history. They showed a mainly 
stable, partially consolidating trend in 2021 across 
the three key indices following a significant jump 
in 2020:
Inclusive Meritocracy Index (IMIX) – see definition 
on page 41: 78 (stable compared with 2020).
Employee Engagement Index (EEI) – measures the 
degree of satisfaction, loyalty, advocacy and pride 
of Allianz‘ employees: 76 percent (2020: 78 %).
Work Well Index (WWi+) – measures the stress 
level of employees for work-related strain 
including the topics demands, rewards, control, 
support, social capital and processes as well as 
tool and resource availability. A higher index score 
is associated with better employee health and 
productivity: 69 percent (2020: 70 %).We expected a slight setback as uncertainty 
after the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic 
reduced and these results are in line with general 
observed employee engagement trends.
Survey dimensions showing the most improvement 
were Manager with 86 percent (2020: 85 %) and 
Collaboration and Communication with 80 percent 
(2020: 79 %).
Based on the results, the overarching themes for 
creating impact on engagement in 2022 are:
• Reward and recognition, for example by 
reviewing and fostering the Global Equal 
Pay Initiative;
• Implementing and monitoring the new WOW; 
• Further engaging managers as the main 
drivers of survey follow-up processes; 
• Continuously encouraging best-practice 
sharing across teams and operating 
entities; and
• Extending the listening strategy to capture 
feedback and signals from our employees 
through quarterly pulses.

02.4.4 Health and well-being
The health and mental well-being of 
our employees is a top priority. Our goal 
is to maintain and improve employee 
health and well-being across our global 
workforce by providing a consistent 
framework with minimum requirements 
for all Allianz entities to support our 
new WOW.
Work Well
Our Work Well program, launched in 2015, 
aims to provide a healthy and productive 
workplace to enable our employees to reduce 
work-related stress. Ten minimum actions 
were rolled-out globally, including stress-
awareness and leadership behavior trainings, 
flexible working arrangements and access 
to employee assistance programs. Efforts to 
implement the Work Well program globally 
have paid off, demonstrated by feedback on 
implementation as measured through our AES. 
In 2021, the Work Well Index Plus (WWi+) score 
was 69, one percentage point below the 2020 
result of 70 percent. This trajectory is in line with 
the overall development of global absentee rates 
which were at 6.9 days (2020: 6.9) in 2021. 
  You can find more details in our People Fact 
Book 2021.Acting on employee feedback – four 
Minimum Health Requirements
Based on the New Work Model pulse survey with 
over 7,800 participants globally, we merged the 
Work Well Program into four Minimum Health 
Requirements to drive action. The four Minimum 
Health Requirements have been added to the 
pan-European agreement on work-related stress.1 
1. Access to professional psychological 
support for all employees worldwide
We provide 24-hours anonymous, free-of-
charge professional psychological hotlines to all 
employees to seek expert support and advice if 
needed. The implementation of such an Employee 
Assistance Program (EAP) is mandatory for all 
operating entities by 2022 as specified in the 
global HR standard.
2. Training people leaders to maintain 
health and well-being in their teams
We aim to train 100 percent of people leaders in 
the first year of their leadership role to build up 
personal resilience and well-being among their 
employees. The training is delivered through the 
#lead module ‘Personal resilience and well-being’ 
or other comparable training sessions, which all 
people leaders globally are required to complete.3. Regular touch points to collect employee 
feedback on their health and well-being
We ask for direct employee feedback on health 
and mental well-being initiatives on a quarterly 
basis to identify needs and take appropriate 
follow-up actions. The minimum requirement for 
operating entities is to collect feedback as part 
of regular pulse surveys as of 2021. Our global 
ambition is to gain more than 90 percent EAP 
awareness and 70 percent satisfaction with

4. Meeting Free Calendar Days @Allianz
We aim to provide dedicated focus time for 
employees to simply concentrate on their 
tasks and their health and mental well-being 
to manage work-related stressors by regular 
Meeting Free Calendar Days @Allianz. Our 
ambition is that more than 70 percent of 
operating entities will have implemented 
Meeting Free Calendar Days by the end of 
2022. As recognition of the contribution of our 
employees during the pandemic, the Allianz SE 
Board of Management granted one additional 
day off for all employees globally in 2021 as 
special means of recognition.97 % 
of Allianz’ operating entities successfully 
implemented an EAP hotline.
95 % (12,117) 
of Allianz people leaders in scope have 
completed the #lead experience, including a 
training module on personal resilience and 
well-being to maintain and promote health 
within their teams.
39 
operating entities participated in a pulse survey 
to assess employee awareness of EAPs and 
satisfaction with feedback channels on health and 
well-being with a response rate of 49 percent. 
75 percent of employees were aware of the EAP 
hotlines and 64 percent were satisfied with the 
feedback options. 
86 % 
of operating entities rolled out  
Meeting Free Calendar Days @Allianz.

Embedding health and well-being 
Health and well-being managers at each 
operating entity are responsible for driving 
activities to implement the Minimum Health 
Requirements. They are required to do so 
in accordance with local requirements and 
regulations and the Allianz Operating Model 
to ensure each operating entity applies the 
same high standard of local health and safety 
management. This includes activities to meet local 
occupational health and safety standards. 
We also rolled out the Allianz health app ‘Well 
together’ The aim of this app is to combine the 
topics of health and sustainability under one 
holistic platform to motivate our employees to 
exercise more, live healthy and, at the same time, 
protect the environment. By the end of 2021, 
24,000 users have registered on the app.
Allianz is a signatory of the pan-European 
agreement on guidelines concerning work-
related stress. We have placed great emphasis 
on addressing the root causes of work-related 
stress, offering effective solutions and making 
changes to the work environment that enable 
employees to realize their full potential. Allianz SE’s 
management and the European SE Works Council 
have also signed a joint declaration on remote 
work. This guidance provides good practice 
principles for operating entities and employee 
representatives to use in the investigation and 
the deployment of remote work. The Allianz 
Group encourages Allianz operating entities 
and employee representatives to develop 
local applicable rules based on this guidance, 
adapted to local legislation and requirements. 
This serves as good practice guidance for Allianz’s 
companies deploying remote work and covers all 
aspects of flexible working arrangements outside 
Allianz premises. Looking after our people during 
the pandemic
We continue to closely monitor the impact of 
COVID-19 on our global workforce. The pandemic 
cast a spotlight on the importance of health and 
mental well-being and we introduced various 
measures to support employees and meet our 
business needs during the crisis. These included 
help/advisory lines for physical and mental 
health issues, preventative health measures 
and special support for working parents such as 
additional leave to enable parents to take care 
of unexpected childcare needs.
Convinced that vaccination will help to fight 
the global pandemic, Allianz has conducted 
vaccination campaigns in 16 countries (Africa/
Ghana, Bulgaria, Germany, France, Japan, 
Colombia, Croatia, India, Indonesia, Laos, 
Lebanon, Malaysia, Austria, Poland, USA and 
Egypt) in 2021. In addition, booster shot 
campaigns have started.02.4  Human resources

02.5 Customer satisfaction
At Allianz, we promise our 
customers confidence in 
tomorrow. We deliver on 
this promise by earning their 
trust through the quality of 
our products, the level of our 
services and the expertise of 
our employees. With Customer 
Centricity we strive to go above 
and beyond for our customers 
and aim to outperform 
the competition. 
Our customer experience strategy
Customer satisfaction and loyalty lead to 
profitable growth and are key elements in our 
strategy. Our ambition is to create meaningful 
solutions and experiences that draw in customers. 
We designed our customer experience framework 
to give customers a direct voice and enable 
us to use their feedback in shaping local and 
global experiences.
Listening to our customers
The closer we are to our customers, the more we 
can be there for them in moments that matter. 
Listening to our customers is the starting point of 
our journey. Our Voice of the Customer program 
applies a holistic and standardized methodology 
to monitor and improve customer journeys by 
collecting real-time qualitative and quantitative 
feedback. After each touchpoint a customer 
has with Allianz, they are invited to state their 
satisfaction on a five-star scale at predefined touchpoints along five customer journeys. 
If customers rate their experience with three stars 
or less, we close the loop by following up with 
them via a phone call to resolve the issue directly 
and gather more insights. 
By the end of 2021, 41 operating entities and 
global lines had implemented the Voice of the 
Customer program. This means we have rolled out 
at least one of the five mandatory journeys at our 
major operating entities. 
Measuring customer loyalty
We use the globally recognized Net Promoter 
Score® (NPS) as the key metric for measuring 
customer loyalty through customers’ willingness 
to recommend Allianz. Our target for 2021 was 
for over 75 percent of Allianz Group business 
segments to score above market or at Loyalty 
Leader position and 50 percent at Loyalty 
Leader position. We exceeded this by achieving 
84 percent outperforming (2020: 79 %) and 
58 percent Loyalty Leaders (2020: 60 %). The main 
drivers for our improvement were addressing 
customer pain points to improve customer 
service via the Voice of the Customer program, 
product simplification, digital services, measures 
in response to COVID-19 and targeted brand 
communication campaigns.

Board target 50% by year-end 2024
In 2022, we will switch to digital NPS tracking. 
Digital NPS allows us to measure customer loyalty 
continuously, thereby eliminating seasonality 
and deepening our understanding of customers’ 
sentiment. Additionally, this new measurement 
will set higher standards for our operating entities 
(e.g.: broader set of competitors). Therefore we 
have adjusted our digital NPS targets accordingly. 
Our Group ambition is to reach 50 percent of 
loyalty leaders by 2024.
Using data to create better 
customer experiences
We use insights from Voice of the Customer and NPS 
to improve our products, services, communications, 
and processes. We combine and analyze sources of 
customer data in strict accordance with applicable 
privacy laws (e.g. NPS, Voice of Customer ratings 
and verbatim feedback) to prioritize and implement 
structural improvements. At the local level, operating 
entities use customer feedback to derive concrete 
actions. For example, we uncovered that many 
complaints across customer journeys and markets 
mention the speed of processes. This is something 
we are working to improve at a global level with the 
Allianz Customer Model.Learnings gained through the Voice of the 
Customer and NPS programs are also helping 
us design the global Allianz experience for 
customers. In 2021, we rolled-out a set of global 
guidelines to our operating entities to ensure 
a consistent expression of our Allianz brand 
across markets. These cover how we interact 
with customers over the phone, the visuals used, 
communication tone and physical spaces. 
Rather than selling individual insurance products, 
our vision is to evolve our products into full 
ecosystems and offer customers relevant and 
trusted solutions. Through this we can give 
customers confidence in tomorrow and live out 
our promise. In parallel, we are collaborating with 
the Allianz Customer Model to systematically 
analyze customer pain-points and together 
upgrade our customer journeys at the Group level.

Transforming our business for customers
We’ve listened to our customers and we know that 
they want us to sell simple products, use easy-
to-understand insurance language and provide 
faster claims handling. They also want to be able 
to access their insurance details whenever and 
however they choose. We have adapted our 
business in response by simplifying and digitalizing 
our products, processes and platforms. As a result, 
our customers have a better understanding of 
what they are buying and greater access to advice 
and support, while more efficient processes are 
improving our customer service. 
The Allianz Customer Model (ACM) is our end-
to-end global business model which puts the 
customer at the center of our business and 
enables Allianz to be simple, digital and scalable. 
Simplifying and harmonizing our business globally 
means transforming the whole value chain across 
products, sales, claims and operations. This is 
already providing real customer satisfaction. Within this context, ACM was designed first for 
Retail Property and Casualty lines and then 
extended to Health, Life, B2B2C, MidCorp, 
Large Corporate and Reinsurance. It has been 
continuously rolling out across Allianz operating 
entities and, by end of 2021, was presented in more 
than 30 countries covering 95 percent of property 
and casualty retail gross written premium.
A tangible example of how ACM is transforming 
our business is the new structure of our products. 
We now focus on offering simple and intuitive 
products with a maximum of three variations 
and limited number of add-ons per product offer. 
Launched in Allianz Germany in January 2020, 
Privatschutz 2.0 was the first fully ACM-compliant 
product. After its introduction, Privatschutz 2.0 
has generated 2–3 times more new business 
compared to the previous product. It forms the 
foundation for our global non-motor product. We have created 15 master products, which will 
reduce the number of products in most relevant 
operating entities from more than 1200 in 2019 to 
around 250 by 2024.
We are scaling ACM via the Business Master 
Platform (BMP). The BMP is a new global IT 
solution for Allianz that digitalizes the business 
requirements of ACM by integrating them with the 
IT Master Platform. It comprises a combination of 
the scalable technological elements, systems and 
services plus functionalities and configurations 
defined by the ACM to better serve our customers, 
intermediaries, partners and employees.
BMP also scales the ACM philosophy with one look 
and feel and one outstanding user experience 
that gives our customer, agents and partners 
anywhere in the world the same experience and 
satisfaction when easily interacting with Allianz. 
For example, the claims tracker in BMP provides 
full transparency to our customers throughout the 
claims process. Customers can easily access the 
portal and navigate with just a few clicks to choose 
the preferred settlement option and repair shop 
and receive confirmation of the repair appointment 
with a rescheduling option. The BMP will be rolled 
out for at least one retail line of business in five 
operating entities by the end of 2022.Sales compliance 
Since 2011, Allianz has a global Sales Compliance 
Program in place, which describes standardized 
processes and controls for communication, 
monitoring, and review. 
The program is managed by Group Compliance. 
In 2020, the Sales Compliance Framework 
was revised to reflect recent developments 
in regulatory standards and to condense its 
existing sales compliance requirements into 
a new corporate rule, the Allianz Standard 
for Sales Compliance. This Standard is now 
the organization’s consolidated framework 
for customer protection. It outlines rules and 
principles for compliant and ethical sales 
practices across the Allianz Group and specifies 
key principles to ensure appropriate fairness 
and transparency to customers, including in 
respect of the remuneration of distributors, 
and to address the sales compliance risks arising 
in its business segments. 
These responsible sales controls reflect Allianz’s 
clear commitment to fairness and transparency 
as formulated in Allianz’s Code of Conduct. 
This Code emphasizes that being fair and 
transparent with its customers about its products 
and services, including their limitations is the best 
guarantee to enjoy customers’ long-term trust.02.5  Customer satisfaction

02.6 Environmental management
As part of our commitment 
to a sustainable future, we 
manage the most significant 
environmental impacts of 
our operations and aim to 
continuously improve our 
environmental performance. 
We strive to be a role model 
in delivering our own targets 
on environmental protection 
and climate change in order to 
influence others in our industry 
and beyond to do the same. 
Our carbon reduction strategy is designed to 
reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from 
material sources of Allianz Group operations 
emissions, namely energy use for office buildings 
and IT, business travel and paper use. The strategy 
focuses on energy-efficient planning, construction 
and operation of buildings, sourcing green 
electricity and using carbon efficient vehicles. 
The Allianz environmental management system 
(EMS) provides clear standards and controls, 
supports environmental data collection, and 
promotes transparent reporting of environmental 
impacts across the Group. It guides the monitoring 
and management of our carbon footprint, use of 
energy and natural resources such as water and 
efforts to reduce waste.Implementation of the EMS is monitored by 
the Group Environment Officer (part of Global 
Sustainability, see page 51) and supported by 
the Board of Management of Allianz SE. In 2021, 
961 percent of employees were included under 
the scope of the EMS (2020: 97 percent) 
(see   Table ENV-1). 
  Further information on our Group Environmental 
Guideline can be found here.
Raising standards through certification
We apply targeted environmental management 
system (EMS) processes, certified to ISO14001 
standard, to improve environmental management 
governance practices at our major locations. 
This began in 2017 with the certification of our SE 
location in Munich. Mandatory requirements of 
certification help strengthen our approach – for 
example, it is a requirement of ISO14001 to have 
a Board-level sponsor for our EMS. At Allianz 
SE, this sponsor is our Chief Operations Officer. 
Allianz Turkey became the latest entity to achieve 
ISO14001 certification of its Allianz Tower and 
campus locations in February 2021. Opportunities 
to secure environmental certification at other 
locations will continue to be evaluated based on 
local context and operations.GHG emissions
60 %
reduction in GHG emissions per employee 
achieved by year-end of 2021
against a target reduction of 30 percent per 
employee by year-end 2025 (2020: 42 percent 
reduction) against a 2019 baseline across Scopes 1, 
2 and selected Scope 3 emissions (currently energy-
related emissions, business travel and paper use).
This reduction is mainly the result of increasing 
the share of renewable power in our energy 
mix, delivering a structured approach to energy 
management and reduced business travel 
resulting from COVID-19. We expect to include 
GHG emissions from remote and hybrid working 
within scope of our future reporting to reflect 
upcoming infrastructure changes.
  Full details of our GHG emission disclosure, 
including by Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions, 
are provided in  Table ENV-2.Reducing energy consumption
26 % 
reduction in energy consumption in our office 
buildings per employee during 2021
against a target reduction of 20 percent in 
office buildings per employee by year-end 
2025 (2020: 20 percent reduction) against a 
2019 baseline.
This was mainly due to energy management and 
local data center closures in remaining locations 
as part of the Group’s data center consolidation 
combined with COVID-19 related measures.
  Details of Allianz’s energy consumption can 
be found in  Table ENV-3.
Our operating entities are developing targeted 
approaches to reduce energy consumption. 
For example:
• Allianz SE has developed a holistic energy 
concept to identify measures to reduce energy-
related GHG emissions and overall energy 
consumption at the Schwabing Campus. 
• Allianz Turkey is reducing its small regional 
offices and moving to daily/hourly rent, thereby 
decreasing building energy consumption. 
• Allianz France is implementing the ISO 50001 
energy management standard to continuously 
improve energy efficiency of buildings with a 
systematic approach for both premises and 
real estate portfolio.

Renewable electricity
77 % 
of the electricity we used came from  
renewable, low-carbon sources in 2021 
against a target of 100 percent for 2023. 
(2020: 57 percent) (see   Table ENV-5).
With this, we achieved our mid-term target of 
70 percent through a combination of strategic 
discussions with suppliers on ‘green tariffs’ 
(64 percent), expanding the use of on-site 
renewable technologies (0.04 percent) and first-
time sourcing of ‘unbundled’ renewable Energy 
Attribute Certificates (13 percent). 
As a signatory of the RE100 initiative, we have 
committed to source 100 percent renewable 
electricity (RE) for our group-wide operations 
by 2023. With operations in more than 70 
countries, achieving this is complex and will 
require significant engagement and collaboration 
with electricity suppliers and landlords. In 2020, 
we started to embed RE in the management 
targets of our Board of Management and CEOs 
of Allianz entities. This includes annual targets 
towards achieving 100 percent RE by 2023.
In 2021, we made Energy Sourcing a strategic 
procurement category for the first time and 
established central governance and expertise 
within the Sustainable Operations office. This will 
shift our energy procurement from locally-driven 
to globally-driven processes, increasing our 
impact and streamlining efforts. The new 
strategic energy procurement function will 
play a key role in our internal power-sourcing 
transformation journey. It lays the foundation for determining best-fit strategic renewable 
energy solutions across the Group and engaging 
with the unbundled renewable Energy Attribute 
Certificate (EAC) market in countries where the 
renewable energy market is less developed, as a 
temporary solution.
Cutting GHG emissions from 
business travel
70 %
reduction in GHG emissions from business travel 
per employee achieved by year-end 2021 
against a target reduction of 15 percent per 
employee by year-end 2025 (2020: 59 percent 
reduction) against a 2019 baseline. 
Measures taken in response to COVID-19 played 
a material role in reducing business travel 
emissions across 2020 and 2021. Managing 
business travel post COVID-19 will be key for 
2025 GHG target achievement. Our new Ways 
of Working (see section 02.4) will capitalize on 
this shift to minimize emissions from business 
travel by enabling more flexible and agile 
working practices.
As part of our transition to low-carbon operations, 
we are shifting to hybrid and electric vehicles 
(EVs) in our corporate fleet. For example, 
AZ Technology has launched a new Mobility 
Policy for Allianz entities in Germany which will 
see company cars with combustion engines 
exchanged with plug-in hybrid or electric 
vehicles upon the termination of their lease.
  Further information about our fleet policies 
can be found in section 03.6. Green commuting
We have committed to develop Green 
Commuting Plans to limit emissions that arise 
from our employees commuting to and from the 
workplace. Plans prioritize walking, using public 
transport and use of EVs with a range of actions 
for operating entities to implement – from 
bike leasing to discounted public transport 
and EV charging stations. In 2021, 65 percent 
of employees (by headcount) across our 
operating entities were covered by a Green 
Commuting Plan.
Reducing paper use
33 %
reduction in paper use achieved by year-end 2021
against a target reduction of 20 percent per policy 
by year-end 2025 (2020: 14 percent reduction) 
against a 2019 baseline.
Our paper use is mainly linked to external 
communications (e.g. marketing and customer 
communications) with a smaller amount used 
for internal office printing. Our efforts to reduce 
paper consumption are underpinned by the 
increasing shift towards digital communication. 
Looking ahead, we will also seek to maximize 
the share of paper used to come from certified 
sustainable sources, which accounted for 
76 percent of our paper in 2021.Reducing water use
41 %1 
water reduction achieved by year-end 2021
against a target reduction of 10 percent per 
employee by year-end 2025 (2020: 23 percent 
reduction) against a 2019 baseline. 
This reduction was achieved through water saving 
measures applied across our locations combined 
with COVID-19 related measures. For example, 
Allianz Turkey started to reuse rainwater for 
cooling and landscape maintenance and Allianz 
Suisse is installing water-saving attachments 
for taps. Water saving awareness campaigns 
are also helping to address behavioral change 
of employees.
Minimizing our water consumption is a key 
principle under our Group Environmental 
Guidelines. Our office-based operations mostly 
do not result in significant water use but we 
reflect the increasing need to use water efficiently, 
especially considering the impacts of climate 
change. This is especially important in areas at 
risk of water-stress such as India and Singapore. 
Approximately two-thirds of Allianz employees 
are situated in countries with medium to extremely 
high water stress.202.6  Environmental management

41 % 
waste reduction achieved by year-end 2021
against a target reduction of 10 percent per 
employee by year-end 2025 (2020: 29 percent 
reduction) against a 2019 baseline.
We aim to minimize the waste we generate 
and to re-use and recycle materials wherever 
possible (see  table ENV-8). Our office-based 
operations mostly generate household-type waste, 
in particular tackling waste from single use plastic 
has come into focus. Waste reduction awareness 
campaigns are in place across Allianz entities to 
address behavioral change of employees. Action on plastic
We have developed global guidelines on 
systematically working towards single use 
plastic free operations. We have introduced this 
topic in our reporting for the first time in 2021. 
For example, AZ Technology has introduced 
plastic-free offices which aim to completely avoid 
single-use plastics within all Allianz Technology 
branches and subsidiaries. Allianz Partners also 
launched a plastic reduction initiative to remove 
single-use plastic from all entities’ premises. 
We have defined ‘Action on plastic’ measures at 
three levels:
1. Assessment of baseline usage of single use 
plastic across our operations. 
2. Definition of targets and action plans per 
operating entity, including allocation of 
resources and launch of implementation. 
3. Progress assessed and reported to the project 
management sponsor, action plan checked 
and reviewed within reporting period.
By the end of 2021, 67 percent of operating 
entities (by headcount) had completed at least 
level one. Allianz is also partnering with the international 
marine conservation organization, Sea Shepherd 
Global, to support cleaning the Mediterranean 
Sea of plastic waste from abandoned fishing gear.
Invested in forest protection since 2012
Allianz has invested in projects to offset its 
operational emissions since 2013, such as the 
Rimba Raya project in Borneo, Indonesia. 
This area is rich in biodiversity including the 
endangered Bornean orangutan and was at 
risk of being converted into palm oil estates. 
By helping to prevent the deforestation of 
nearly 65,000 hectares of peat swamp forest, 
the project aims to avoid more than 130 million 
tons of carbon emissions in addition to protecting 
biodiversity and benefiting the local community 
through local revenues and construction of 
renewable energy plants, a health clinic and 
two libraries. The Rimba Raya project meets 
the requirement of standards under the UN’s 
Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and 
Forest Degradation Plus (REDD+) program. 
Emissions savings are independently measured 
and certified once a year. As a result of our 
investment, we retired carbon credits equivalent 
to 138,746 t CO 2e in 2021 (2020: 203,352 t CO 2e).

our foundation
In this section, we continue the discussion of our approaches to 
integrate sustainability in the way we run our business in an ethical 
and responsible manner, and how we interact with our stakeholders. 
This covers topics that are important to them, as determined in our 
materiality assessment.
Highlights include an overview of our Corporate Citizenship 
Strategy, our approach to protecting our customer’s and employee’s 
data and privacy, and how we manage cyber risks. It also includes 
our engagement with governments and regulators and how 
we ensure our behavior is compliant with ethical expectations. 
Finally, we touch on our approach to integrating sustainability in 
our procurement activities. 
  An overview of the qualitative targets and achievements 
related to these topics can be found in section 05.1

03.1 Corporate citizenship
Underlying our overarching social approach 
(see section 01.4), we have further evolved its 
Corporate Citizenship Strategy, to fully live our 
responsibility towards society. We are deeply 
aware that our actions have the potential to 
influence the future living conditions and well-
being of next generations. Our decisions today 
play an integral part in determining this future. 
Allianz is committed to having a positive social 
impact. We understand social impact as the effect 
our global organization has on the well-being 
of the community – from global society to local 
communities where we live and work.
03.1.1 Renewing our Corporate 
Citizenship Strategy 
We continued to evolve our strategy in 2021. 
Our approach is grounded in our company 
purpose, our group-wide business strategy, 
and the local efforts of our operating entities. 
In our renewed outlook for corporate citizenship, 
we centered next generations in our actions. 
Based on stakeholder feedback we received, 
we included people with disabilities as a focused 
beneficiary group where we as an organization 
feel we can further take responsibility than we 
addressed so far.
Our renewed Corporate Citizenship Strategy will 
be published in the first half of 2022 and will set 
targets for 2022 and beyond, as well as defining 
guidance and criteria for activities under SDGs 8 
and 13.Building confidence 
in tomorrow…
… through our commitment to the 
U.N. Sustainable Development Goals
A key objective of our strategy is our 
commitment to SDG 8 – Decent work and 
economic growth. We harness the efforts 
of our global entities and accelerate the 
implementation of our Corporate Citizenship 
Strategy, we will focus on specific aspects 
of decent work: The overall goal of SDG 8 
– Decent Work and Economic Growth is to 
promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable 
economic growth, full and productive 
employment, and decent work for all.
The target 8.5 is about achieving full and 
productive employment and decent work 
for all women and men, including for 
young people and persons with disabilities, 
and equal pay for work of equal value. 
Another target we focus on is 8.6 – 
Substantially reduce the proportion of youth 
not in employment, education, or training.
We act on target 8.10 (Strengthen the 
capacity of domestic financial institutions to 
encourage and expand access to banking, 
insurance, and financial services for all, 
through our emerging consumer business and 
InsuResilience partnership (see section 02.1).
  Our actions around SDG 8 will be closely 
linked to the other lighthouse SDGs we 
have, SDG 13 Climate Action, and SDG 17 
Partnerships for the Goals.03.1.2 Shaping a positive 
future for next generations
Today’s children and youth are the leaders, 
employees, customers, and investors of tomorrow 
but they face significant barriers to inclusion in 
a world beset with inequality and the impacts 
of climate change. A recent study by Allianz 
Economic Research1 found that the impact of 
COVID-19 on the future outcomes for Gen Z 
(those born between 1995– 2010) are immense, 
especially in four focus areas of SDG 8: education, 
labor, inequality, and health. Particularly striking 
was the increasing high number of youths not in 
employment, education, and training (NEET) with 
knock-on impacts for the longer term. We have a 
role to play in ensuring that the next generations 
can overcome the economic and social impacts 
of the pandemic and other systematic social 
risks. Our long-term approach as an investor 
and insurer is an opportunity to offer measures 
that can mitigate future risks and shape societies 
for generations, for example through pension 
systems, environmental and climate protection, 
education and more. 
03.1.3 Unlocking barriers for 
people with disabilities
People with disabilities make up 15 percent 
of the global population; one billion people 
experience some form of disability.2 On average 
as a group, people with disabilities are more likely 
to experience adverse socioeconomic outcomes 
than persons without disabilities. As COVID-19 
continues to have wide-reaching impacts across 
the globe, people with disabilities have been 
uniquely impacted by the pandemic – including 
health, education, transport and more.3 For young 
people with disabilities, the pandemic has exposed shortcomings, risks, and inequalities 
in education both within and across countries.4 
We have provided opportunities for people with 
disabilities for many years. Now, as a Worldwide 
Paralympic Partner, we became one of the 13 
Iconic Leaders of The Valuable 500, a global 
movement working to put disability on the 
agenda of business leadership. We have made 
support for people with disabilities a main 
component of our Corporate Citizenship Strategy 
to focus our efforts to unlock barriers for this 
group in a more strategic and impactful way.
03.1.4 Measuring our 
social impact 
To drive our contribution towards creating 
systemic change across our target SDGs, we must 
understand and improve the impact we create. 
But measuring and managing impact is not 
without its challenges, as the long-term effects 
of interventions involving multiple stakeholders 
and addressing complex issues can be difficult 
to measure. Common frameworks can serve to 
improve social impact measurement. For this 
reason, we developed the Allianz Social Impact 
Measurement Framework to support local entities 
in setting their ambitions and measuring and 
reporting on the impact of corporate citizenship 
activities locally. We measure: 
• Input – what we contributed 
• Output – what happened 
• Impact – what has changed 
We developed separate guidance and tools on 
impact measurement to create a robust data 
process for corporate citizenship activities across 
our operating entities with a clear set of indicators 
for reporting impact. 01 Introduction

03.1.5 Employee volunteering 
and donations 
Allianz’s workforce has around 150,000 
employees globally and local social impact 
programs, employee volunteering and 
initiatives run together with operating entities 
and our twelve Allianz-affiliated foundations 
contribute to our global impact. While some 
of the in-person volunteering activities and 
programs were able to take place in 2021, 
due to the ongoing pandemic, many of the 
onsite volunteering had to be cancelled or 
postponed. Our combined contributions totaled 
€ 28.2 million (2020: € 43.51 mn); and 73 thousand 
hours (2020: 57 thousand hours) in corporate 
volunteering. In 2020 our contribution in terms of 
donations and volunteering hours was influenced 
by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially with 
the need for additional donations as well as a 
reduction in volunteering opportunities due to 
lockdown measures. In 2021, these contributions 
are returning towards pre-COVID levels. We use 
the Allianz Engagement Survey question: ‘Our company offers enough opportunities for 
me to environmentally and socially support the 
community that we operate in’ as an indicator 
of employee satisfaction around volunteering. 
In 2021 we scored 76 % (2020: 78 %). 
03.1.6 Embedding our global to 
local approach 
Global Sustainability is responsible for developing 
our strategic approach and providing guidance 
to operating entities that are responsible for 
local delivery. 
Within our entities, Corporate Citizenship Leads 
are responsible for locally embedding the global 
approach. In November 2021, we published a new 
Social Impact Guidance for Corporate Citizenship 
Activities for local entities. It is designed to build 
a consistent understanding of social impact, 
strategically channel resources towards the 
SDGs, monitoring of outcomes and encourage 
collaboration and best practice sharing. In 2021 
we launched a Social Impact Fund to replace 
the previous Social Innovation Fund. From 2022, it will provide resources for local partnerships 
that focus on SDG 8. The fund is our key program 
which supports strategic opportunities to deliver 
social impact beyond charitable donations by 
focusing on creating measurable impact through 
intersectoral partnerships.
03.1.7 Being a good 
neighbor and a responsible 
corporate citizen
In addition to our forward-looking Corporate 
Citizenship Strategy, we want to step up and 
support our communities where we live and work 
during times of need. This means aligning our 
activities with local priorities and leveraging the 
expertise, resources, and assets of our operating 
entities to support communities – for example, 
contributing to the emergency response and 
rebuilding communities following natural 
disasters and providing donations and employee 
volunteering during the pandemic and the 
humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. 01 Introduction

03.2.1 Data privacy 
Protecting our customers and their data 
and maintaining trust in our processes 
are high priorities. Our customers, 
employees and other stakeholders 
expect their personal information 
to be treated with the utmost care 
and we take this responsibility 
extremely seriously.
We are committed to protecting customer privacy 
and we cooperate closely with other stakeholders 
involved in the update and modernization 
of European privacy legislation including 
industry associations, members of parliament 
and authorities.
Strengthening our global 
privacy framework
The Allianz Privacy Standard (APS) is our global 
standard for data privacy. It defines rules and 
principles for collecting and processing personal 
data. The standard sets out six privacy principles 
that all employees must respect wherever they 
are in the world: due care; purpose specification; 
reasonable limitation; transparency and openness 
towards employees and customers on where 
personal data is stored and used; choice and 
consent; and privacy by design.
The APS is accepted by our data protection 
authority as our Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs). 
These BCRs allow Allianz Group companies to 
lawfully transfer personal data from within the 
European Economic Area to other jurisdictions, 
where it is required for business purposes. We also 
publish a Privacy Notice which clearly states the 
type of information we collect.Our group-wide privacy program continues to 
mature as we aim to provide services digitally 
through our Digital by Default approach. 
The program includes embedding robust privacy 
controls – such as privacy impact assessments and 
data ethics assessments – monitoring activities by 
creating a privacy-focused culture and the Allianz 
Digital Privacy Guidelines. This builds on the 
Allianz Privacy Framework which provides:
• a global standard for data privacy (the APS);
• a Privacy Impact Assessment and risk 
management process;
• integration with Information Security 
core functions; 
• data privacy and protection monitoring 
activities; and
• training for employees on the appropriate 
processing of personal data belonging to 
customers, employees and third-party partners.
We monitor privacy governance activities and 
processes across our operating entities through a 
robust process which includes site visits, reviews of 
program documents, interviews and expert 
challenge calls. During the pandemic, site visits 
were replaced by virtual meetings without any 
loss in efficacy. We are now conducting activities 
in-person as conditions allow. Despite travel 
restrictions, at least 14 reviews were undertaken 
in 2021. For comparison, 11 and 10 reviews were 
undertaken in 2020 and 2019 respectively.Privacy risk management
We identify and manage privacy risks at the 
operational process level to ensure they are 
measured, monitored and mitigated across our 
core businesses. Privacy Impact Assessments 
(PIAs) of high exposure processes that use 
personal data, such as customer health data and 
employee data, enable the early identification of 
risks to ensure they are managed appropriately. 
In 2021, we developed a global privacy ‘blueprint’ 
of risk scenarios and control to support local 
compliance efforts with the APS across the entire 
Allianz Group. The blueprint provides a tool for 
identifying data privacy risks in local business 
processes and addressing those risks by mapping 
them to standard controls. This does not replace 
existing compliance requirements under the APS 
to conduct PIAs, rather it is a tool to supplement 
existing data privacy compliance efforts and 
help operating entities analyze and identify data 
privacy risks in their business processes. 
We also commit to ensuring that adequate and 
effective controls are in place to address data 
privacy risks associated with the processing of 
personal data by external suppliers on behalf of 
Allianz. In 2021, we developed new controls across 
the supplier life-cycle along with guidelines for 
supplier management which supplement the APS 
and are a mandatory part of the Allianz Privacy 
Framework. These controls are embedded in the 
Allianz Group Integrated Risk and Control System 
catalogue and Protection and Resilience Control 
catalogue to ensure close alignment between the 
data privacy, operations and risk functions.03.2.2 Data ethics
Allianz values data as a key asset and strives to 
position itself as a leading player in leveraging 
data in the most compliant and ethical way, 
both as insurer and investor. We set up the Allianz 
Data Ethics Project in response to the increasing 
regulatory initiatives and public debate on data 
ethics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) worldwide to 
strengthen the internal governance framework for 
AI and position Allianz in the regulatory field. 
In 2021, we established a Data Advisory Board 
(DAB) which covers data ethics and selected 
data-related topics on a more permanent 
basis. The DAB consists of representatives from 
operating entities and functions including 
Data Analytics, Data Architecture, Privacy and 
Regulatory Affairs. Its objectives are to: 
• elevate data ethics and selected data and 
analytics-related topics in the governance and 
decision-making processes of Allianz Group; 
• position Allianz as a leading insurer and 
investor in the ethical and effective usage of 
data and Artificial Intelligence/Analytics; and
• support the overall sustainability efforts and 
activities of Allianz Group.
In addition, the newly developed Allianz Practical 
Guidance for AI was rolled out in various 
operating entities, accompanied by a dedicated 
communication and training program for 
relevant employees. Privacy and Ethics Impact 
Assessments were introduced to identify and 
address AI-specific risks. With these measures, 
data scientists, business and control functions 
dealing with AI solutions are supported to embed 
‘Ethics by Design’ in our organization and oversee 
challenges and risks in the area of AI.GRI

Engaging and training employees
In 2021, we provided refresher data privacy 
training for all employees involved in processing 
personal data, where legally required. New 
employees continue to be onboarded with the 
global data privacy training, launched in 2018. 
Together, these trainings ensure employees 
across the organization have a suitable level 
of knowledge concerning the principles of 
confidentiality and data privacy.
In 2021, we hosted our sixth Allianz Privacy 
Summit to discuss supplier management best 
practices, anonymization of personal data, 
privacy governance monitoring and the impact 
of new data privacy laws.
03.2.3 Information security
The Allianz Risk Barometer 20211 
ranks cyber risk as the top three risk 
of doing business globally with more 
respondents highlighting it as a top risk 
than in 2020. We continuously adapt our 
approach with a key focus on managing 
cyber risk for our own company and 
for our customers through targeted 
insurance solutions.
Information Security is the application of technologies, 
processes and controls to protect systems, networks, 
programs, devices and data from cyber-attacks. 
As a core business discipline, information security 
is managed globally through a robust and mature 
governance framework aligned with international 
standard ISO 27001. Our approach is closely Specific measures to improve security controls 
are continuously evaluated and developed with 
priorities assigned on a global, risk-based view. 
Measures focus on five key risk areas: reducing 
the likelihood of incidents; increasing detection 
likelihood; reducing damage from incidents; 
streamlining compliance; and training/educating the 
organization to further improve security awareness.
All employees are required to participate in 
at least quarterly cyber-awareness training. 
These include activities like simulated phishing 
e-mails, awareness campaigns or regularly 
offered dedicated Information Security trainings. 
We also participate in industry and global/
regional initiatives to support the security of the 
overall internet ecosystem.
Managing cyber risk for our customers 
Ransomware has become an increasing risk for 
businesses across all sectors. With no easy remedy 
in sight, the onus is on individual companies to 
invest in cyber security to make life harder for 
gangs to launch ransomware attacks. The number 
of ransomware attacks may continue to increase 
before the situation gets better.2 Those companies 
that take steps now to prevent attacks and mitigate 
the impact will be far less likely to fall victim 
to ransomware and will find it easier to secure 
required levels of cyber insurance. As insurers, 
we must continue to work with our clients using 
a combination of policy, pricing and service 
improvements to help businesses understand the 
need to strengthen their controls.Developing new insurance 
solutions to manage cyber risks
Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty (AGCS) 
protects organizations around the world against 
cybercrime and digital threats. The types of 
risks it covers include first-party losses (e.g. 
business interruption, restoration and crisis 
communications) and third-party losses (e.g. 
data breaches, network interruption and 
notification expenses). 
We are constantly evolving our solutions to enable 
more customers to manage the risks. Over the 
past three years, we have reviewed and changed 
where applicable cyber risk exposure coverage 
across P&C policies spanning commercial, 
corporate and specialty insurance segments. 
This is never a ‘set and forget’ process and we 
are always looking to improve on the situation. 
The cyber underwriting strategy, which has 
been implemented to address cyber exposures, 
is reviewed regularly and we are continuing the 
journey of ensuring relevant policies are updated 
and clarified in regard to cyber risks.
Cyber insurance offers much more than just 
compensation for potential financial losses. 
It also includes valuable prevention and incident 
response services that enable companies to 
improve their cyber resilience and mitigate 
negative impacts after an incident. AGCS’s expert 
consultants also support customers to recover 
from an incident and to ensure proper disclosure 
of a privacy incident to regulatory bodies 
and customers.

Officer (CISO) function and the Allianz Group 
Board of Management. An executive accountability 
regime supports the enforcement of the governance 
framework for all entities. 
The Allianz Information Security governance 
framework comprises multiple layers of corporate 
rules and processes. An overall policy establishes 
core principles, roles and responsibilities as well 
as the organizational framework for Information 
Technology and Information Security within 
Allianz Group. 
Associated functional rules provide further 
details and specific implementation guidelines 
for operating entities. The functional rules are 
complemented by detailed descriptions of 
best practices to be followed across 14 defined 
topics to ensure the ‘security by design’ principle. 
Information Security is regularly audited, 
both internally and externally, and is trained 
regularly in dedicated exercises across all layers 
of the organization.
03.2.4 Cyber risk
Managing cyber risk in our business
Cyber risk is assessed and tracked as one of the 
top risks faced by Allianz and is closely managed 
along eight key risk indicators across the Allianz 
Group. Performance against these indicators is 
reported quarterly to the Board of Management 
and Supervisory Board. Monitoring for cyber 
incidents and measures to prevent them are 
implemented at a global level and supplemented 
locally where required, together with the local 
Information Security Officers (ISOs) that exist in 
all Allianz operating entities.

03.3 Regulatory and public affairs
As a financial services company, 
we operate in a highly regulated 
environment. This requires us to stay 
current with changes in the regulatory 
and political landscape, but also to 
help shape effective regulation by 
contributing through our knowledge 
and expertise.
Group Regulatory and Public Affairs (GRPA) is the 
center of competence and central coordinator for 
all regulatory and political management activities 
across the Allianz Group. GRPA is based at 
Allianz’s headquarters in Munich with field offices 
in Berlin and Brussels. The department’s purpose 
is to enable Allianz to navigate and help shape 
the regulatory and political environment.To keep abreast with regulatory changes, 
we maintain a robust fact base around potential 
policy actions and assess the likely outcomes. 
GRPA advises management to ensure the impact 
of regulatory and political developments is 
accounted for in the Group’s strategy and business 
activities. It also supports local Allianz companies 
with regard to regulatory and political strategy 
(e.g. the interpretation and handling of upcoming 
EU regulations or by sharing best practices) and 
oversees and coordinates regulatory and political 
topics within the Group.
In our engagement with regulators and 
policymakers, we adhere to the Allianz Code 
of Conduct. Engagement topics in 2021
Our engagement with regulators and 
policymakers included the following 
topics in 2021:
• Sustainable finance regulation: 
environmental and social taxonomy; 
international sustainability reporting standards; 
sustainability disclosure and digitalization of 
sustainability data.
• Supporting public-private cooperation: 
financing the green and digital transitions 
and achieving the U.N. SDGs.
• Prudential regulation: Solvency II review; 
E.U. Recovery and Resolution directive; IFRS 17.

03.4 Compliance
Our success is built on the trust 
of our customers, investors, 
employees and the public 
have in our performance and 
integrity. This depends on 
the personal ethical conduct 
and capability of all Allianz 
management and employees, 
and their desire to create value 
for all stakeholders.
Compliance mission 
Our Compliance function fosters a corporate 
culture of individual and collective responsibility 
for ethical conduct and adherence to the rules by:
• enabling our employees to understand and 
live by the rules and oversee that adequate 
and effective processes are in place to 
ensure adherence;
• supporting the business to identify, assess and 
mitigate compliance risks;
• maintaining a confidential channel to report 
concerns, act on them and protect those who 
speak up in good faith; and
• interacting transparently and truthfully 
with regulators.Allianz Group Code of Conduct
The Allianz Group Code of Conduct (CoC) is 
at the core of our corporate culture. It outlines 
the basic principles and values that guide the 
everyday decisions and conduct of all employees. 
Every new joiner to Allianz is informed of their 
obligation to adhere to the CoC during their 
welcome presentation. As part of a project led by 
Group Compliance, the CoC was fundamentally 
renewed in 2020 and approved by the Board 
of Management to replace the previous version 
from 2006. The updated CoC considers feedback 
collected from global employees on value 
perception and includes an introductory message 
from the Group’s CEO, a clear link to the new 
company purpose and relevant topics beyond 
traditional compliance including feedback culture, 
diversity, inclusion and sustainability. 
The CoC expresses Allianz’s commitment to 
respecting a wide range of international human 
rights standards including: 
• the Universal Declaration of Human Rights;
• the U.N. Covenants on Human Rights;
• The Core Labor Standards of the 
International Labor Organization (ILO);
• OECD Guidelines for 
Multinational Enterprises; 
• Guiding Principles for Business and Human 
Rights of the U.N.; and 
• The Ten Principles of the U.N. 
Global Compact.
  For further information about our commitment 
to human rights, see section 05.6.The new CoC was rolled out across the Group in 
2021 along with training for operating entities to 
raise awareness about the principles established 
by the CoC, namely mutual respect, integrity, 
transparency and responsibility. Operating entities 
are in the early stages of planning and delivering 
this training.
Zero tolerance of fraud and corruption
Allianz takes a zero-tolerance approach to fraud 
and corruption. We are committed to complying 
fully with local and international anti-corruption 
and anti-bribery laws. Our aim is to go beyond 
complying with the minimum standards of the 
law, such that the Allianz Anti-Corruption Program 
sets standards for a consistent and comprehensive 
group-wide approach in every jurisdiction. 
The program requires that employees and certain 
third parties with whom Allianz does business 
are prohibited from offering, accepting, paying 
or authorizing any bribe or any other form of 
corruption, be it with the private sector or with 
government officials. 
Anti-Corruption training is compulsory for all 
employees with online and classroom training 
delivered in multiple languages. To ensure 
online trainings achieve acceptable levels of 
understanding and awareness, they include 
a mandatory test component that must be 
completed and passed for the training to 
be deemed to have been completed by the 
employee. In 2022, we will introduce Anti-
Corruption training KPIs in line with the World 
Economic Forum (WEF) requirements. 
No material violations of corruption laws 
or corresponding official proceedings were 
reported to Group in 2021 which would have 
been required to be disclosed to Allianz Group’s 
Audit Committee. Anti-money laundering
In accordance with applicable legal requirements, 
Allianz Group operating entities establish risk-
based policies and procedures to prevent the 
risk of money laundering and terrorism financing 
based on customer identification, verification and 
monitoring, as well as suspicious activity reporting. 
We employ screening and monitoring systems and 
processes to manage risks and ensure compliance 
with anti-money laundering requirements and 
economic sanctions restrictions.
Respecting economic sanctions 
and embargoes 
We have global policies and procedures in place 
to ensure compliance with trade and financial 
sanctions. These include requirements for the 
screening of customer and counterparty names 
against the sanctions lists provided by the U.N., 
E.U. and the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control 
(OFAC). Allianz’s global requirements also include 
an enhanced review requirement for high-risk 
transactions related to countries, sectors or parties 
subject to sanctions restrictions.
Due to the nature of our clients’ underlying 
business transactions, some of Allianz’s insurance 
coverage and other business can relate to 
countries, sectors or parties subject to sanctions 
restrictions. For example, where permitted, 
we may issue insurance for humanitarian services 
provided by our clients in sanctioned countries. 
The Allianz Sanctions Compliance Program aims 
to ensure we respect all applicable restrictions 
and that these high-risk transactions undergo 
enhanced scrutiny.GRI

Fair competition
We believe fair competition and access to the 
market drives innovation, stimulates growth 
and benefits the consumer. As a global player 
and a leading provider in our sector, we have 
a responsibility to act in compliance with 
competition law. 
To meet this responsibility, the global Allianz 
Antitrust Program consists of the Allianz Antitrust 
Standard and the Antitrust Code. The Standard 
lays out core principles and measures to be 
adopted across the Group in order to ensure 
compliance with antitrust law. The Code provides 
a set of core behavioral rules that employees 
must observe when dealing with competitors, 
customers and business partners. We provide 
regular classroom and online trainings to top 
management and exposed employees to refresh 
and develop their understanding of antitrust 
rules and how they affect their daily business. 
Questions and feedback received on the 
application of training content show the positive 
impact and efficacy of the training.
Managing compliance 
In 2021, the Compliance Function underwent 
a transformation in the way it assesses Group 
and local Compliance Departments. In the past, 
the focus was primarily on local implementation 
of global programs (e.g. Sanctions, Anti-Fraud, 
Anti-Corruption, Anti-Money Laundering, etc.) 
to ascertain the Compliance Culture of our 
Operating Entities. Review procedures have been 
expanded to confirm adequate compliance 
scope, assure adequate skills to ensure complete 
and effective scope coverage and confirm compliance with global programs in addition to 
local specificities. The changes also reinforce a 
compliance-by-default and by-design mindset 
through an evaluation of the status (e.g. standing) 
of a compliance function within the enterprise 
(e.g. the compliance function has a role/voice in 
major strategic and operational considerations). 
This holistic approach was rolled out in the second 
half of 2021 through the Compliance Assurance 
of Risks and Effectiveness (CARE) program. 
While CARE is primarily a self-assessment 
exercise, it is reinforced with compliance reviews 
of operating entities, completed and coordinated 
by Group Compliance. Compliance reviews are 
completed on a risk-based, five-yearly cycle. 
This program is aligned to the CARE program 
so that operating entities are encouraged 
to exercise better rigor in the assessment of 
control effectiveness against the background 
of anticipated confirmation activities. Group 
Compliance is itself subject to external, 
independent evaluation by one of the ‘Big 4’ 
companies. It is evaluated based upon CARE 
elaborated criteria which have been certified as 
being compliant with regulations which define 
requirements for compliance organizations. 
Compliance Reviews are supplemented 
by Targeted Reviews. These assess the 
implementation status and effectiveness 
of individual programs such as Anti-Trust, 
Sales Compliance, etc. The benefit of this 
multi-faceted review and confirmation strategy 
is that operating entities are monitored more 
frequently and are engaged in more holistic 
assurance activities. Additionally, the frequent 
interactions with operating entities provide additional opportunities to monitor, guide 
and, if necessary, enforce remedial activities. 
An additional benefit is the ability to learn from 
local and group best practices, further bolstering 
our overall Compliance Culture.
As a matter of course, the development in the 
ongoing proceedings in connection with the 
Allianz GI U.S. LLC Structured Alpha funds would 
also be monitored by the compliance function and 
considered as part of the regular reassessment of 
compliance risks. Major findings will be reflected 
in the continuous improvement of our Compliance 
Management System and compliance processes.
Voicing concerns
Allianz offers employees multiple channels for 
raising concerns. Employees are encouraged 
to report breaches and misconduct and 
given information on where and how to do 
so. These include via management, speaking 
directly with Group Compliance, by e-mail, 
and anonymously via the inhouse SpeakUp@
Allianz service found on our Group Intranet. 
Some operating entities provide employees 
with a dedicated telephone hotline. All reported 
incidents are assessed, documented and 
managed according to internal guidelines 
and confidentiality is strictly adhered to. Group 
Compliance runs an annual awareness campaign 
to remind employees of the avenues for reporting.GRI

03.5 Tax transparency
COVID-19 dramatically 
affected governments’ finances 
and raised the topic of tax 
responsibility up the agenda. 
We see the taxes we pay 
as an important part of our 
contribution to the sustainable 
development of the countries in 
which we operate. We believe 
fair, effective and stable tax 
systems are beneficial for both 
government and companies.
Allianz acts transparently and responsibly in 
all tax matters and works closely with the tax 
authorities to ensure that we pay our fair share 
of taxes. Our processes and internal governance 
implemented in line with our tax strategy are 
set to ensure full compliance in every jurisdiction 
where we operate.
As regards the Allianz Group’s tax strategy, 
the strategy has been approved by the Board 
of Management of Allianz SE as the ultimate 
decision taking body. Our tax strategy is 
transparent and closely aligned to our business 
strategy and also to our sustainability goals – 
which focus on the relevant U.N. Sustainable 
Development Goals. Guided by our Sustainability Strategy, we embed environmental (E), social (S) 
and governance (G) aspects in all our business 
and corporate citizenship activities; responsible 
tax is a fundamental part of this. Our Code of 
Conduct sets out our values and principles and 
serves as a guide to our behavior. These values 
and principles are also reflected in our tax 
strategy, which requires full compliance with tax 
regulations and tax laws in all countries in which 
we operate. Our tax strategy has been approved 
by the Board of Management of Allianz SE and 
is reviewed on an annual basis. It comprises the 
following strategic priorities: 
• Full compliance with tax regulations, accurate 
and timely reporting and effective tax 
risk management. 
• Safeguarding of the Group’s reputation as a 
responsible taxpayer. 
• Existence of a sound organizational set-up for 
appropriate tax management. 
• Full compliance of tax planning and optimization 
activities with tax laws, supported by solid 
business reasons to sustain a credible long-
term reputation with tax authorities.
• Disclosure of meaningful tax information in a 
transparent way.
• Continuous improvement and harmonization 
of tax processes through simplification and 
digital solutions.
As a member of the B Team, a coalition of 
business and civil society leaders advocating sustainable business practices, Allianz promotes 
the B Team Responsible Tax Principles.1 
They provide a common framework of core 
principles and practical commitments for 
companies to demonstrate responsibility and 
sustainability in their tax approach. 
Our strong commitment to transparency 
is reflected in the publication of our Tax 
Transparency Report.2 This provides insight into 
our approach to taxation which is in line with our 
tax strategy and discloses an expanded country 
based reporting.
In compliance with the OECD Base Erosion and 
Profit Shifting (BEPS) Actions, we prepare a 
Country-by-Country-Report for the Group and 
submit it to the German tax authority which 
shares the data with countries which have signed 
agreements allowing for exchange. 
At this time of public debate around corporate tax 
behavior, we aim to provide transparency over our 
approach to tax and we encourage and support 
others to do the same. To facilitate the debate 
with relevant data, Allianz contributed to the Total 
Tax Contribution study 20213 commissioned by the 
European Business Tax Forum (EBTF).In 2021, we reported € 2.4 billion income 
tax charge on our profits and our Total Tax 
Contribution amounted to € 17.9 billion.

03.6 Sustainable procurement
Our procurement processes 
aim to deliver best value 
for money for our activities, 
products and services while 
reflecting Allianz’s high 
sustainability standards. 
The goal is to develop a 
responsible global supply 
chain by collaborating with 
our suppliers to deliver 
sustainability targets and 
searching for more sustainable 
products and services.
Our strategy and commitment to sustainability 
are supported by our Procurement, Travel and 
Fleet Policies.
To develop our supplier network with increased 
emphasis on sustainability and human rights, 
we must constantly analyze the sustainability 
performance of our supplier network. We must 
also continue to find more sustainable 
products and services by setting up major 
framework agreements and emphasizing 
sustainable products in our ordering offers for 
Allianz employees. 
To drive progress on a global scale, we focus on 
synchronizing activities and sharing best practices 
across our international procurement network. 
In addition, we are defining global responsibilities 
and priority procurement categories – such as 
energy (see opposite) – to optimize demand 
and deliver projects which support our 
operating entities.Developing our supplier due diligence
For suppliers to comply with our sustainability 
standards, they must pass a solid supplier 
screening with newly updated supplier questions 
and a new Vendor Code of Conduct reflecting 
current and upcoming international requirements 
towards human rights, for example modern 
slavery acts (Australia, UK) and the new supply 
chain laws (Germany).
100 %
of our global suppliers, representing a total 
spend of € 1.6 billion, have committed to 
the Allianz Vendor Code of Conduct in 2021, 
the same level as in the previous year.
Focusing on categories that 
have the greatest impact
We already include sustainability questions in 
Requests for Proposal (RfP) and sustainability 
criteria in awarding matrices in some procurement 
events and categories and we are now in 
the process of extending this to all relevant 
procurement categories. 
To identify the priority procurement categories, 
we initiated a structured approach together with 
our environmental experts and procurement 
category experts. Our aim was to identify those 
categories with the greatest impact on Allianz’s 
sustainability performance and customers as 
well as the potential contribution of procurement 
to sustainability-related projects. Through this 
process, we identified three priority areas:• Electricity consumption of Allianz (project 
RE100) and our suppliers (Data Centers 
and Clouds)
• Travel
• Claims sustainability supported by Global 
Insurance Procurement
In addition to our Group approach, our operating 
entities develop local approaches. For example, 
in the UK we have developed a sustainability 
charter, training modules for purchasers and 
a whistle-blowing channel for employees of 
our suppliers. 
Changing electricity consumption 
to green electricity
To support our RE100 commitment to have 100 
percent renewable electricity across our global 
corporate portfolio by 2023, we accelerated 
discussions with local utilities and global energy 
consultants. As a result, we achieved 77 percent 
electricity from renewable, low-carbon sources 
in 2021 (see section 02.6). Our strategic data 
centers used 100 percent certified renewable 
electricity in 2021. We are also exploring the 
inclusion of electricity consumption from suppliers’ 
cloud services into our corporate carbon footprint. 
Where suppliers use electricity on our behalf, we 
aim to encourage them to move to green electricity 
or to compensate adequately for the electricity 
they consume. We are collaborating with industry 
leaders for the provision of cloud services, such as 
Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services.Smart travel and fleet
Where travel cannot be avoided, we launched 
a Travel Awareness Campaign to support 
employees to make sustainable choices on 
business trips. Our travel tools offer a sort and 
transparency function based on CO 2 emissions 
for flight search and we have negotiated CO 2 
compensations for easyJet and Lufthansa flights 
(European routes only). In 2021, we reduced the 
carbon footprint of our fleet and rolled out a new 
mobility policy limiting ordering to hybrid and 
electric cars only and providing both charging 
cards for public parking slots and charging 
infrastructure for employees at home.
Sustainable claims 
We want to encourage and support our providers 
to develop a network and supplier base that 
supports our sustainable procurement ambitions. 
To improve sustainability in the core insurance 
business, Global Insurance Procurement has taken 
the lead on a Group initiative around sustainable 
claims. Its aim is to decarbonize claims processes 
and find ways to make them more sustainable. 
The first focus has been on motor retail claims 
and engaging third parties involved in the claims 
process, such as repair shops. 01 Introduction

As part of our commitment to 
transparency, we apply the 
recommendations of the G20 
Financial Stability Board’s 
Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD). 
We strive to continuously 
enhance our climate change-
related reporting and business 
practices to drive best practice 
and we collaborate with and 
support others to do the same.
This report covers the proprietary investments 
as well as the insurance underwriting of Allianz 
Group. The climate-related disclosures of our 
two asset managers Allianz Global Investors and 
PIMCO can be found on their respective websites.
The Allianz Group Climate Change Strategy 
commits us to reach net-zero greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions by 2050 across our business. 
This is in line with the ambitions of the Paris 
Agreement to limit global warming to a 
maximum of 1.5°C by the end of the century. 
Our priorities include exiting coal-based business 
models by 2040 at the latest, enhancing our 
systematic approach to investee engagement 
and policy advocacy, and implementing the 
TCFD recommendations. Noteworthy developments in 2021
1.  In July 2021, Allianz joined forces with seven 
other leading insurers to form the U.N.-
convened Net -Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA). 
See section 02.1.
2.  Allianz has set decarbonization targets for 
2025 for its listed equity, corporate bonds and 
real estate portfolio. Overall emissions are to 
be cut by 25 percent against a 2019 baseline. 
Targets have also been set for our infrastructure 
portfolio. See section 04.6.
3.  In 2021, the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE 
established a Sustainability Committee to 
oversee Environment Social and Governance 
(ESG) issues and monitor the Board of 
Management’s sustainability strategy. 
See section 05.4.
4.  In section 04.4, we disclose the results of 
comprehensive climate scenario analyses on 
both sides of our balance sheet.
5.  We are working to improve the ecosystem for 
climate and sustainability disclosures by being 
active in Open Source Climate (a group of 
corporates to jointly build a ‘pre-competitive 
layer’ of modeling and data), the European 
Financial Reporting Advisory Group and 
the EU Platform on Sustainable Finance.

04.2 Governance
Given the materiality of climate 
change to our business, we 
govern it at the highest level 
and cascade responsibility 
through to management.
04.2.1 Overarching and 
board-level governance 
Allianz’s climate ambition, strategy and targets 
are decided at the Supervisory Board and 
Board of Management level and cascaded to 
relevant functions. We describe this governance 
approach and how remuneration is linked to 
climate performance in section 01.3 and 05.5 of 
this report.
04.2.2 Business and 
management-level governance 
In 2021, we thoroughly reviewed our approach 
to identify and manage climate change risks 
and opportunities. This review concluded that a 
program to develop and implement continuously 
improved tools, processes and disclosures – 
including appropriate governance structures 
– should be implemented from 2022 onwards. 
The process is steered by a cross-functional group 
of senior executives at Group and OE levels. They 
include the Chief Risk Officer, Chief Sustainability 
Officer, Heads of Group Accounting and 
Reporting, Global Property-Casualty (P&C), 
Global Commercial, Centre of Competence Life 
and Health and one of the Managing Directors 
of Allianz Investment Management. Progress is 
reported to the Group Sustainability Board. 
The governance described refers to the status in 
the reporting year 2021.Group functions 
Addressing sustainability matters requires cross-
functional collaboration and support across our 
global operations. The Global Sustainability 
function includes a team dedicated to Climate 
Integration and is responsible for coordinating 
integration of sustainability and climate 
aspects into core investment, insurance and 
business operation activities. It also acts as the 
secretariat of the Sustainability Board and meets 
regularly with its Chair. Further functions such 
as Group Risk, Global P&C, Global Commercial, 
Allianz Investment Management and Group 
Accounting and Reporting report on climate-
related matters and support operating entities 
in integrating the Group’s strategic approach 
and policies. Additional bodies and functions, 
such as Allianz Research, monitor and analyze 
market, technological and regulatory trends and 
developments and share insights.
Investment and insurance functions
Our key insurance operating entities, two major 
investment businesses (Allianz Global Investors 
and PIMCO) and investment management 
function (Allianz Investment Management) have 
well-established climate and sustainability teams. 
At Allianz Investment Management (AIM), 
the Investment Management Board (IMB) oversees 
implementation of climate and sustainability 
strategy for our proprietary investment portfolio 
of € 849.2 billion. This includes regular updates, 
discussions and decisions on implementation, 
target-setting and compliance related to portfolio 
decarbonization targets and measures. Analyses of 
potential growth opportunities as well as asset 
stranding in climate scenarios and engagement 
on climate aspects are also regularly addressed. 
In 2021, The IMB held a dedicated session on 
physical and transition risk covering the proprietary investment portfolio in a holistic way. Within AIM, 
climate and sustainability are steered at the 
IMB level with a Managing Director in charge of 
the implementation. 
For our P&C insurance business, the ESG 
Business Services team located at Allianz Global 
Commercial & Specialty (AGCS) is responsible 
for developing, coordinating and supervising 
sustainability and climate-related governance.
  For more details, see section 02.2 as well as 
the Allianz ESG Integration Framework. 
04.2.3 Climate competence
In addition to the governance mechanisms 
described above, we apply a variety of 
instruments to foster sustainability and climate 
competency at Board, senior executive and 
employee levels. These include: 
• Extensive reports and briefings for top 
management, translating climate science 
into business implications.
• Sustainability roundtables of 
investment functions.
• Trainings for employees, investment-related 
functions, underwriters and sales agents.
• Knowledge sharing with and upskilling of 
local sustainability colleagues.
• Conferences on sustainability topics which 
include Board member presentations; in 
2021 we held the conference ‘Understanding 
Climate Risks’ and two internal Sustainability 
Forums open to all employees.01 Introduction

04.3 Strategy
Since 2005, the Allianz Group 
Climate Change Strategy 
has encouraged solutions for 
tomorrow’s climate. It steers 
the uptake of climate-related 
risks and opportunities in our 
insurance and investment 
business. Regularly updated, 
it is overseen by the 
Sustainability Board. 
Our 2021 materiality assessment confirmed the 
results of 2019 in finding climate change to be 
Allianz’s top sustainability topic according to 
stakeholder views on the importance of topics to 
our business and to society. See section 05.2 for 
more details on the materiality assessment.04.3.1 Our Climate 
Change Strategy 
The strategy focuses on three areas: Anticipating 
the risks of a changing climate; Caring for the 
climate-vulnerable; and Enabling the low-carbon 
transition. These strategy pillars are described in 
chapter 01.5.3 of this report.
04.3.2 Climate-related 
risks and opportunities 
Climate change will materially affect global 
economies and Allianz’s lines of business. The risks 
and opportunities emerging today will increase 
over the mid- and long-term. They include acute 
and chronic physical impacts on property and 
human health such as warming temperatures, 
extreme weather events, rising sea levels, 
intensifying heatwaves, droughts and potential 
changes in vector-borne diseases. Risks and opportunities also result from the 
cross-sectoral structural change stemming 
from the transition to a low-carbon economy. 
These transition risks include the impacts of 
changes in climate policy, technology and market 
sentiment, and impact thereof on the market 
value of financial assets, as well as impact 
resulting from climate change litigation.
Impact on our business and impact of 
our business 
Allianz Group is exposed to risks that are 
influenced by climate change in a multitude 
of ways. We are particularly impacted in two 
key ways through our core business activities, 
both of which can influence the ability of assets 
to generate long-term value: 
• As an insurer providing insurance policies, e.g. 
covering health impacts, property damage or 
litigation claims, and through changes in the 
sectors and business models we underwrite. • As a large-scale institutional investor with 
significant stakes in various economies, 
companies, infrastructure and real estate that 
might be affected by the physical impact of 
climate change and the transition to a low-
carbon economy. 
The largest risks in our risk profile are market risks, 
especially equity risk, credit and credit spread 
risks driven by assets backing long-term liabilities. 
P&C premium and reserve risks, resulting from 
natural and man-made catastrophes and from 
claims, uncertainty must be considered.

04.3  Strategy
Internal analysis shows that our proprietary 
investment portfolio, especially the listed equity 
and corporate bonds asset classes, is most 
sensitive to climate transition scenarios. This is 
mainly because equity investments are directly 
affected by climate-related impacts and changing 
market expectations and resulting market 
valuation. In contrast, for a long-term investor like 
Allianz, impacts on debt investments would be 
felt first by a changing of spreads and to a lesser 
extent by impairment of debt service of assets. 
In section 04.4 we disclose different quantitative 
and qualitative assessments for physical and 
transition risks. 
As well as being impacted by climate change, 
the choices Allianz makes about how to conduct 
its business have an impact on climate change, 
e.g. by investing in or insuring activities which 
either cause or reduce GHG emissions. To manage 
potentially detrimental impacts on both climate 
and our business, we have committed to align 
our proprietary investment and insurance 
underwriting portfolios to 1.5°C climate scenarios. 
04.3.3 Our response
We embed the management of risks and 
opportunities resulting from climate change 
in our overall business strategy. Measures 
include: developing and adjusting financial 
products and services; updating policies and 
processes; setting targets and limits; managing 
our operational climate footprint; and engaging 
with internal and external stakeholders. Long-term ambition and the 
Net-Zero Alliances 
After the release of the landmark Special 
Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) in October 2018, we thoroughly reviewed 
the implications for our corporate response. As a 
result, we increased our ambition from ‘well below 
2°C’ and committed to pursuing efforts to limit 
global warming to a maximum of 1.5°C by the 
end of the century. This is postulated as the upper 
ambition level of the Paris Agreement and the 
European Union’s long-term climate strategy.
As a major outcome of incorporating the 
assessment of climate-related risks and 
opportunities into our business strategy, we co-
founded the U.N.-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner 
Alliance (AOA) and Net-Zero Insurance Alliance 
(NZIA), thereby committing to setting long-term 
emissions reduction targets for our proprietary 
investment portfolio, insurance underwriting and 
business operations. 
  The AOA is explained in more detail in section 
02.2 and the NZIA is explained in section 02.1.
In 2020, Allianz set intermediate targets following 
the guidance of the AOA for the asset classes listed 
equity, corporate bonds and real estate. In 2021, 
we also set targets for infrastructure investments. 
Our targets cover all four dimensions as described 
in the U.N. AOA Target Setting Protocol and are 
explained in detail in section 04.6.1.Managing transition risks 
Fundamental to managing transition risks 
is an understanding of the pathways along 
which companies can, and should, develop 
their business models to align with 1.5°C. 
Allianz continuously conducts detailed analysis 
of energy-intensive sectors’ emission profiles, 
prototypical decarbonization pathways and 
necessary technology shifts within sectors 
and companies.
As part of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for 
Net-Zero (GFANZ) Allianz is leading the work on 
sectoral decarbonization pathways to enhance 
development, understanding and uptake. As part 
of this, we are also engaging with top-down and 
bottom-up modelers of those pathways.
We use the results for portfolio analysis, for risk 
management and to inform our engagement 
process and management decisions. Emissions 
footprints are used as a proxy for transition 
risks and are therefore covered in our 
decarbonization targets.
Allianz started to restrict financing coal-based 
business models in 2015. Equity stakes have been 
divested, existing fixed income investments put 
in run-off and no new investments have been 
allowed since 2015. We do not offer insurance 
for individual coal power plants or mines and we 
require all companies across our P&C insurance 
and proprietary investment portfolio to fully 
phase out coal by 2040 at the latest. Our criteria 
are continuously tightened as explained in more 
detail in our public Statement on Coal-based 
Business Models. A more detailed explanation of 
our coal approach is included in section 02.2.Seizing on opportunities 
Our business strategy includes systematically 
leveraging opportunities to finance a low-carbon 
and climate-resilient future, e.g. by investing 
in renewable energy, energy efficiency in real 
estate and electric vehicle infrastructure and by 
providing insurance solutions to protect against 
physical climate impacts and support low-carbon 
business models. For proprietary investments, 
the Allianz ESG Functional Rule for Investments 
provides the foundation for integrating 
climate-related issues. It comprises asset 
manager selection and systematic integration 
of climate and sustainability factors into our 
investment decisions. 
 Read more in our ESG Integration Framework 
We have strategically invested in low-carbon 
assets for over a decade. This includes renewable 
energy, certified green buildings and green bonds 
(see section 02.2.2). Our Sustainable Solutions 
program provides products and services that 
create shared value by improving people’s lives 
and/or delivering a positive environmental 
impact. Allianz is one of the leading insurers 
of low-carbon technologies. As part of our 
Sustainable Solutions approach, we provide 
standardized and tailor-made insurance products 
and are insuring renewables in 70 countries. 
We also aim to reduce the impacts of climate 
risks and incentivize preventive measures to 
increase customers’ resilience and compensate for 
climate-related damages. Examples include risk 
consulting services offered by AGCS, our active 
support of the InsuResilience Global Partnership 
and our work with the German Corporation 
for International Cooperation (GIZ) to pilot 
innovative insurance solutions in emerging and 
developing countries. 01 Introduction

04.3  Strategy
Active company dialogue, joining forces 
and targeted engagement 
We actively engage investee companies and 
insurance clients using a variety of channels 
and formats. A key forum for engaging the 
167 most carbon-intensive companies is Climate 
Action 100+ (CA100+), a collective engagement 
platform made up of more than 600 global 
investors responsible for more than $60 trillion 
in assets under management across 33 markets. 
Our goals and actions in CA100+ are explained 
in section 02.2.3.
AIM has a dedicated engagement function 
for proprietary investments. AIM systematically 
engages with external asset managers on 
climate integration, climate risk management, 
proxy voting processes and public discourse. 
In addition, our internal asset managers, AllianzGI 
and PIMCO, and our insurance entities are active 
stewards on climate-related matters. 
  For more details on our engagement 
approach please see section 02.2 and 02.3. 
  For voting records of AllianzGI, please refer 
to their overview web page. 
We are joining forces with other asset owners 
in encouraging companies to implement 
transition pathways. Our participation in the 
Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI), CA100+ and 
the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) 
connects us with like-minded investors and offers 
opportunities for collaborative engagement. 
On decarbonization matters, the AOA strives to 
be the link between these existing engagement 
platforms, asset owners, target verification 
initiatives and tools and policymakers.Addressing climate change in our own 
business operations 
We rate impacts from climate change risks on the 
operations of the Allianz Group to be of limited 
materiality. The exposure of Allianz offices and 
data centers to locations at high risk of extreme 
weather events is contained and managed 
through risk mitigation measures as well as 
business continuity and disaster recovery plans. 
The low-carbon footprint of our operations makes 
us less prone to carbon price risk and we have 
committed to reduce it further (see section 02.6). 
Forest protection to protect carbon sinks 
and biodiversity 
In 2019, we committed to pursue efforts to limit 
global warming to a maximum of 1.5°C by the 
end of the century and aim for net-zero emissions 
by 2050. We have claimed our operations to 
be ‘carbon neutral’ since 2012. This has been 
achieved through investments in the protection 
of existing rainforests (Wildlife Works Carbon 
and Rimba Raya), maintaining significant 
carbon sinks and biodiversity while empowering 
the local population through job creation, 
provision of health care and education and 
preserving biodiversity.
Looking ahead, we believe the focus should be 
both on reducing emissions in line with science 
and protecting natural systems. We have set 
corresponding targets to reduce emissions in 
our investments and operations. Science has 
made clear that the 1.5°C target will require 
an upscaled removal of emissions from the 
atmosphere into technical and natural carbon 
sinks. The IPCC defines carbon neutrality as achieved when anthropogenic emissions of GHGs 
to the atmosphere are balanced by anthropogenic 
removals over a specified period. We support 
this understanding in the context of our net-
zero commitment. We expect to define our new 
strategy on this matter in 2022.
Partnerships, memberships and 
financial industry engagement 
We actively contribute to specialized initiatives 
that focus on decarbonization, including: 
• The Glasgow Financial Alliance for  
Net-Zero (GFANZ), NZIA, AOA and Science 
Based Targets initiative (SBTi) represent 
the commitment to decarbonize our 
operations, proprietary investments and P&C 
insurance underwriting. 
• CA100+ coordinates the investor community 
engagement of 167 of the largest global 
corporates on climate matters and Allianz 
leads engagements. 
• The Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) assesses 
the climate performance of corporates across a 
variety of sectors. 
• The G7 Investor Leadership Network (ILN) 
and Institutional Investors Group on Climate 
Change (IIGCC) serve as networks to share and 
develop best practice. Allianz is represented on 
the board of both. 
• Open Source Climate is a group of corporates 
to jointly build a ‘pre-competitive layer’ of 
modeling and data that is globally shared and 
accessible. Allianz is represented on the board.Through our additional memberships, including 
The B Team and World Economic Forum (WEF) 
Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, we encourage 
companies within our sector and beyond to step 
up and improve their climate strategies and 
climate disclosures, as well as develop our own.
Allianz partners with international organizations 
to drive climate-smart investment and insurance. 
One example is the Sustainable Development 
Investment Partnership (SDIP) which aims to 
scale the use of blended finance in sustainable 
infrastructure investments in developing countries, 
an initiative coordinated by the WEF with support 
from the OECD. Another example is our three-
year strategic alliance with GIZ aimed at ‘Closing 
the Protection Gap’ around climate risks in 
developing countries. 
We are an active member of climate-related 
industry associations and initiatives including the 
Munich Climate Insurance Initiative, Chief Risk 
Officer Forum, Climate Finance Lab, Accelerating 
Sustainable Finance initiative, Geneva Association, 
ClimateWise, RE100 and others.

04.3  Strategy
Advocating for strong climate policy
A supportive policy environment is crucial to 
ensure the viability of a socially-just transition 
to climate resilience and net-zero emissions. 
Without decisive action by governments, 
there will be insufficient frameworks and market 
incentives to bring down demand for emission-
intensive products and to allocate capital in 
line with a 1.5°C trajectory. The private sector, 
including insurers, can play an important role in 
raising government awareness and making the 
business case for getting on track to deliver the 
Paris Agreement. 
Asset owners like Allianz are in a unique position 
in the financing value chain, especially those 
setting themselves portfolio targets and therefore 
being dependent on change in policy and the real 
economy to achieve them. 
In 2021, we continued to advocate for a 
green recovery to build back better after the 
COVID-19 pandemic. As part of the recovery, 
government spending and recovery packages are 
playing a pivotal role in underpinning economies, 
infrastructures, jobs and livelihoods. Policy and 
fiscal decisions taken now cut across numerous 
policy areas and will either pave the way for 
necessary structural changes – or delay action. 
Allianz has been vocal through engagement 
from Board-level to working-level interventions, 
joint calls to action and dedicated papers such as: 
• The U.N. convened Net-Zero Asset Owner 
Alliance Discussion Paper on Governmental 
Carbon Pricing;
• The WEF Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders’ 
statement to G7;
• German Business Statement for crisis 
management coordinated by Stiftung 
Klimawirtschaft (formerly Stiftung 2 Grad);• The Investor Call for Ambitious Methane 
Regulation for the Oil and Gas Industry;
• We Mean Business letter to G20.
We also advocate for: 
• Embedding ‘net-zero by 2050’ in short- and 
long-term governmental climate targets, 
climate strategies and emissions reduction 
plans, following latest climate science which 
requires at least halving emissions every 
decade in line with pathways of no or low 
overshoot of a 1.5°C temperature rise. 
• Development of sector policies to promote a swift 
and just transition including the development of 
more granular short-, medium- and long-term 
zero carbon infrastructure plans. 
• Stringent carbon pricing to internalize the 
external costs of pollution, including a phase-
out of direct and indirect fossil fuel subsidies. 
• Protection of nature and support for regenerative 
forestry and agriculture. 
• Support for and potentially redirecting of 
subsidies to scale-up new technologies 
that will provide solutions in hard to abate 
sectors, e.g. carbon capture and storage and 
green hydrogen. 
• Promotion of mandatory assured climate 
reporting and transition plans like GHG 
emissions, associated reduction targets and 
alignment with 1.5°C trajectories. 
• Climate disclosure aligned with TCFD and the 
E.U. Sustainable Finance agenda, in particular 
the E.U. sustainability taxonomy.
• Sustainable finance regulation that provides a 
defined, science-based and reliable framework 
via a common taxonomy of sustainability, 
clarification of asset managers’ and investors’ 
duties, inclusion of sustainability in prudential 
regulation, and enhanced transparency of 
corporate reporting.01 Introduction

05 Our universal principlesTowards open source climate data, models and analytics 
More and more financial institutions are 
committing to align their portfolios with the 
Paris Agreement. One of the main barriers they 
face is accessing trusted data and transparent 
analytical tools to quantify and act decisively 
on climate-related risk and opportunities. 
Current regulation and methodologies are not 
standardized enough and the market for data 
and tools is highly fragmented. To improve 
this, Allianz is supporting and contributing to 
advancing climate disclosures in a number 
of ways:
1. We are a member of Open Source Climate 
(OS-C), an initiative hosted under the 
Linux Foundation to enable like-minded 
companies to build a ‘pre-competitive layer’ 
of modeling and data that is globally shared 
and accessible. OS-C links company data, 
climate analytics (scenarios and stress-
tests) and scientific climate models in one 
platform, allowing for global collaboration 
on this exceptional data challenge which will 
accelerate innovation.  Allianz is heavily involved in the development 
of the prototype along with other large 
corporations like Amazon, Microsoft and 
Goldman Sachs. OS-C also develops a 
prototype Implied Temperature Rating tool 
in line with the TCFD’s work on Portfolio 
Alignment. It will start with four sectors 
(Automotive, Oil & Gas, Steel and Utilities).
2. Allianz is a member of the Project Task Force 
for non-Financial Reporting in the European 
Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) 
which prepares the elaboration of possible 
E.U. non-financial reporting standards 
in a revised Non-Financial Reporting 
Directive (NFRD).
3. We are the only insurer within the E.U. 
Platform on Sustainable Finance which 
acts as a permanent expert group of the 
European Commission to assist developing 
the E.U.’s sustainable finance policies, 
notably the further development of the 
E.U. taxonomy.

04.4 Strategy resilience, stress-tests and climate scenario analysis
Climate change considerations 
are an integral part of our 
insurance and investment 
strategy. 
We apply various quantitative and qualitative 
approaches to carry out climate stress testing 
and scenario analysis in consideration of the long 
time horizons over which climate change may 
unfold and the high uncertainty over the direction 
of future climate and economic developments. 
Our objective is to foster risk awareness, build 
expertise in the assessment of financial risks from climate change, test our business strategy 
and inform risk management and business 
decision making. 
We perform sensitivity and scenario analyses 
with time horizons up to 2050 and including 
scenarios ranging from 1.5°C to 4°C of average 
warming by the end of the century. We make use 
of internal models and external tools. While time 
horizons naturally differ depending on the lines 
of business under consideration, the range of 
scenarios we apply allows us to better assess the 
variety of risks and opportunities associated with 
climate change.When we conduct analyses which assess 1.5°C 
scenario alignment, we adjust our scenario 
selection using guidance developed by the AOA 
which is focused on 1.5°C scenarios with no or 
low overshoot of 1.5°C of warming which limits 
the need to remove GHG emissions from the 
atmosphere in the second half of the century. 
When conducting outside-in impact scenario 
analysis, we use a broader range of scenarios 
in terms of temperature outcomes and 
characteristics. Qualitative assessments are 
conducted to explore to what extent and across 
which channels climate change risks affect 
different aspects of our business, unconstrained 
by the still limited availability of quantitative 
models. As an example, we report results from 
qualitative exposure screening for investments 
using a transition risk heat map in section 04.4.1 
and insights from a survey based assessment for 
P&C retail business in section 04.4.2. 
We deploy quantitative assessments for indicative 
sizing of our exposure to climate change risks. 
A top-down approach is developed to assess risks 
at the level of our balance sheet, in a first step 
applying scenario data provided by the Bank 
of England for the Climate Biennial Exploratory 
Scenario 2021 (CBES 2021) for the analysis of our 
investment portfolio presented in section 04.4.3. Complementary bottom-up modeling for the most 
relevant exposures provides insights into climate 
change risks at the level of individual investment 
or underwriting projects and may support 
contextualization of results from top-down 
analyses. This is showcased in the carbon price 
stress-test for listed equity and corporate bonds in 
section 04.4.4, the inland flood risk case study for 
real estate (see case study on page 80) and the 
analysis of inland flood and tropical cyclone risks 
for property insurance liabilities in section 04.4.5. 
Note that the analyses included in this report 
reflect our current approaches to climate change 
risk assessments. Prevailing methodological and 
data limitations as well as the high degree of 
uncertainty inherent in any long-term analysis 
may still limit decision-usefulness of some results. 
However, these approaches will change over time 
as climate scenarios evolve in line with research, 
developmental-stage methods improve further 
and industry best-practices emerge.

04.4  Strategy resilience, stress-tests and climate scenario analysis
Further examples of the application of scenario 
analysis include: 
• Prospective and existing infrastructure assets 
undergo a thorough due diligence along 
evaluation criteria, considering an asset’s GHG 
emissions and potential impact on capital 
expenditures and performance. Assets are 
required to have a clear and time-lined 
strategy showing how they will adapt to a 
decarbonizing world. 
• Allianz Real Estate regularly conducts an 
energy and carbon performance overview of its 
direct real estate portfolio, including indicative 
decarbonization targets. Furthermore, 
Allianz Real Estate piloted the application 
of in-house climate scenario analysis for 
investment portfolios. This work builds on 
internal underwriting tools to assess location-
based physical climate risks and paves the way 
to use them on the asset side as well. • For our business operations, threats as a 
result of climate change and other extreme 
weather related events are assessed on 
a forward-looking basis via an emerging 
threat assessment that is conducted between 
Allianz Technology and the Allianz Group. 
This assessment aims to identify top emerging 
threats, including interdependencies, and the 
definition of potential mitigation strategies, 
following a multi-step process involving 
external market research, expert reviews 
and surveys.

the most recent assessment included adverse 
impacts from increasing frequency and severity 
of extreme weather events on Allianz premises, 
consequences of heatwaves on operations and 
energy efficiency of data centers under rising 
temperatures, and potential challenges with 
regard to the implementation of future energy 
efficiency regulation. 
The threat of business disruptions and damaged 
or destroyed assets due to extreme weather 
events already exists under current climate 
conditions. Further increase of this threat due to 
climate change is addressed through review and 
update of risk mitigation measures and business 
continuity and disaster recovery plans. Other 
defined mitigation strategies targeted to mid- or 
long-term issues range from developing solutions 
for managing data center load and cooling at 
temperature peaks to designing implementation 
concepts for regulatory requirements.

04.4.1 Top-down qualitative 
transition risk exposure 
screening of investment portfolio
Allianz Research calculated the macroeconomic 
negative impact of increasing regulatory intensity 
on the global industry at nearly 2.5 trillion 
U.S. dollars over the next decade, while also 
identifying opportunities for a variety of sectors. Methods
The analysis focused on the most important 
measures of climate policy currently enacted 
or under discussion. These measures can be 
grouped into the following categories: carbon 
pricing; energy mix and efficiency mandates; 
mobility regulations; and industry-specific taxes, 
fines and levies. Costs for businesses depend on 
emissions’ costs, regulation and policy dynamics. 
The ultimate risk is a complete loss of value of 
certain assets or entire businesses. According to report findings, the energy sector will 
be hit hardest with an estimated cost of 900 billion 
U.S. dollars. The steel sector follows with a cost of 
300 billion U.S. dollars. The air and marine transport 
sector faces 55 billion U.S. dollars costs. Other sectors 
at risk include automotive, chemicals, pulp and 
paper, retail and machinery/manufacturing. 
The report also presents a heat map showing 
transition risk severity for the next twenty 
years and drivers and mitigating factors for 
different sub-sectors. An extract of the results is 
shown below.1 We have used the findings of this macroeconomic 
analysis for internal analyses. For this year’s 
report, we introduce an overview of the exposure 
of our proprietary investment portfolios to the 
sub-sectoral risks shown above. We assume a 
static portfolio where the sector allocation would 
remain the same and where risks are evenly 
spread within the sector. 
Results
Mapping listed investments to the heatmap 
provides a first indication in which sectors the 
main exposures to transition risk are concentrated 
in and how these exposures evolve over time on 
the assumption of a static portfolio. Using this 
approach, less than 4 percent of our combined 
listed equity portfolio and listed corporate bond 
portfolio would fall in the category of being prone 
to high or very high climate change risk in a 1.5°C 
scenario considering the 2020 risk landscape. 
This is mainly driven by the utilities exposure in 
the corporate bonds portfolio. Over time this 
share grows, led by exposures to energy intensive 
industries in the materials and industrials sectors. 
According to the heatmap, a step change in the 
exposures to high and very high climate change 
risk is to be expected after 2030 due to policy 
tightening, particularly affecting the oil and gas 
related energy sectors. The share of sectors at 
high or very high risk would increase to around 
18 percent by 2040. 
Naturally, our investment portfolio will not remain 
static over this time horizon. Implementing our 
decarbonization strategy and the corresponding 
targets will also adapt both inter- and intra-sector 
allocation to provide effective mitigation against 
this exposure increase – our strategic response to 
identified risks is summarized in section 04.4.6.04.4  Strategy resilience, stress-tests and climate scenario analysis

04.4.2 Top-down qualitative risk 
assessment for retail P&C
Given their business focus and flexibility, 
we consider qualitative approaches as suitable 
tools to identify risks and opportunities as well 
as response options from a strategic angle. 
They allow us to explore in principle a rich set of 
transmission channels and interdependencies 
that do not have to be hardwired from the 
outset. Here, we report on a pilot survey-
based assessment covering our major P&C 
retail lines of business which we launched as 
part of our first iteration towards building a 
comprehensive qualitative risks and opportunities 
assessment framework. 
Methods, assumptions and limitations
The Network for Greening the Financial System 
(NGFS) provides six scenarios with differing levels 
of physical and transition risks. For the qualitative 
risk assessment, we have chosen the two ‘extreme’ 
scenarios of ‘Divergent Net-Zero’ and ‘Current 
Policies’ to present two clearly distinguishable 
development paths to the participants of the 
survey. ‘Divergent Net-Zero’ is characterized 
by ambitious and immediate, but rather un-
coordinated climate policies. The net-zero target 
will be reached in 2050; physical risks will be low 
as compared to scenarios with more severe global 
warming, but the lack of policy coordination 
across sectors results in rather high transition 
costs, compounded by fast technological change. 
The scenario ‘Current Policies’, on the other 
hand, assumes that only currently implemented 
policies are preserved, implying relatively slow 
technological change and low transition risks 
but high physical risks; by end of the century, 
global warming will exceed 3°C.For the first round qualitative risk assessment, 
we decided to keep the scope of the exercise 
straightforward with regards to lines of business 
and time horizons. Participants were asked to give 
their assessments for the retail motor and property 
lines of business and for two time horizons (2022 
to 2030 and 2031 to 2050). The survey was limited 
to Europe, our main market. Giving participants a 
better understanding of how the scenarios might 
affect the business environment, we augmented 
NGFS data with specific business drivers such 
as the numbers of electric vehicles or targets for 
retrofitting buildings.
Risks and opportunities from climate change 
were assessed on a four-point scale based on 
qualitative criteria such as shrinking markets, 
higher claims, dwindling reinsurance capacity or 
changes that increase the market’s susceptibility 
to disruption, also considering efforts that need to 
be undertaken to adapt to a changing business 
environment. Ratings were established for volume 
and profitability impacts as well as overall 
consequences. The subsequent assessment of 
requirements towards risk mitigation considers 
whether effective mitigation is provided by 
business-as-usual risk management practices, 
such as re-pricing or reinsurance, or whether 
extraordinary measures such as a business-line 
exit need to be taken, and whether a strategy on 
how the business might respond to the risk has 
already been elaborated. Ratings are commented 
for proper contextualization of the survey 
participants’ choices. 
Results
We show a summary of results of the pilot 
assessment, which was performed by the 
Allianz SE Global P&C leadership team, in the

Line of business Time horizon Divergent Net-Zero Current Policies

Long-term Negative Negative
Property retail Short- to mid-term Positive Neutral
Long-term Positive Positive
Transition risks under the different scenarios can 
be further differentiated into three categories: 
policy, technological and consumer preferences. 
All three will weigh on future premium growth 
and profitability in retail motor. Higher carbon 
prices, for example, will translate into higher 
mobility costs. At the same time, expected high 
public investments should make public transport 
more attractive. Consumers will react to these 
shifts by reducing car ownership and individual 
mobility. These trends are likely to accelerate 
after 2030. For Allianz, technological change 
is the main driver for declining profits in motor 
retail, i.e., higher loss ratios. Although frequency 
of claims might decline thanks to better 
technologies, this is more than offset by severity, 
i.e., higher costs for repairs and spare parts. 
Over the long-term, this should be reflected in 
pricing and then technological impact turns 
neutral. Physical risks like extreme weather events 
are assessed to have only a minor impact on 
claims in the motor business.
While the ‘Divergent Net-Zero (1.5˚C)’ scenario 
is expected to have a clearly negative impact on 
the retail motor business, the story is different for 
retail property. Here, an overall positive impact 
is expected, in particular for top-line growth, 
i.e. Gross Written Premium. The main drivers are 
new standards for buildings (the policy aspect of the transitions risks) which require corresponding 
insurance cover and offer new opportunities. 
Furthermore, increased NatCat risks are likely 
to lead to higher premiums. On the profitability 
side, the picture is more nuanced. More extreme 
weather events will lead to rising claims, 
but pricing and portfolio steering should be 
able to neutralize the impact on the bottom line.
Turning to the scenario ‘Current Policies (3.0˚C)’, 
assessments are similar, but transition impacts 
are seen generally as less severe; this is in 
particular true for the short- to mid-term time 
horizon. As policies stay more or less unchanged, 
the trends of less individual mobility and more 
climate efficient buildings will unfold more slowly. 
Therefore, the qualitative risk assessment expects 
almost no change in the business environment 
until 2030. Only after this the impact of these 
trends will be felt, and in the same direction as in 
the ‘Divergent Net-Zero (1.5˚C)’ scenario (negative 
for retail motor due to declining premium volume 
and positive for retail property through rising 
premium volume). For the bottom line, profitability 
impacts from more extreme weather events are 
seen as rather neutral for both lines of business, 
even over the longer time horizon. This also 
applies to the ‘Divergent Net-Zero (1.5˚C)’ 
scenario for the same reasons.

04.4  Strategy resilience, stress-tests and climate scenario analysis
Outlook
The first round of the survey-based qualitative 
risk assessment for P&C retail business delivered 
valuable insights. Moving forwards, qualitative 
risk assessments will be performed through 
a step-by-step process for the most relevant 
P&C business portfolios, expanding the scope 
with regards to client segments and regions. 
Further development of the approach is planned 
to make it fit for feeding into business strategy 
and decision-making related to identified 
risks and also business opportunities (e.g., 
for product development, portfolio management 
and provision of risk consulting services). 
Upon repeating the exercise in coming years, 
it will be interesting to see how these assessments 
change over time as climate policies and, 
correspondingly, climate scenarios continue 
to evolve. 
04.4.3 Top-down quantitative 
climate stress-test for investments 
The initial assessment of financial risks from 
climate change on the Allianz investment 
portfolio we report here leverages on a rich set 
of climate scenario data developed by the Bank 
of England for regulatory stress-test purposes 
in 2021 (Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario, 
CBES), using input from NGFS reference scenarios 
and various other sources. We may adopt other 
scenarios for similar top-down analysis going 
forward, depending on analysis objectives. Methods, assumptions and limitations
The CBES 2021 provides three scenarios exploring 
different levels of transition and physical risks.1 
The Early Action (EA) scenario assumes an 
early and orderly transition to net-zero by 2050, 
with limited impact on economic growth. The 
late and disorderly transition to net-zero entails 
a sudden contraction of the economy in the 
Late Action (LA) scenario in 2031, only slowly 
recovering to growth by 2050. Physical risks are 
negligible in the EA and LA scenarios over the 
2050 time horizon. Accounting only for climate 
policies that were in place before 2021, the No 
Additional Action (NAA) scenario is characterized 
by limited transition risks and high physical risks 
which start to materialize over the second half of 
the century.201 Introduction

04.4  Strategy resilience, stress-tests and climate scenario analysis
We use pathways for financial and 
macroeconomic risk variables extending 
from 2020 to 2050 as provided by the Bank 
of England. These are expanded to adapt 
sectoral and regional coverage to the Allianz 
investment portfolio. Simple proxy models are 
applied for some asset classes where suitable 
valuation factors are missing in the scenario 
data. To separate the impact of climate change 
risk from trend growth, stress levels are assessed 
relative to a baseline or counterfactual scenario 
and hypothetical variable pathways that 
would be expected in the absence of transition 
or physical risk. Instantaneous stress on the 
static year end 2021 investment portfolio is 
assumed for the calculation of stress impacts, 
without adaptation or mitigation actions.
One major benefit of the CBES 2021 scenarios 
is their comprehensiveness. This supports 
ease-of-use for stress testing as compared to 
other scenarios. The magnitude of outcomes, 
however, have to be taken with a pinch of salt 
accounting for the crucial role of assumptions 
made in building the scenarios. This notably 
includes assumptions for the counterfactual 
scenario which have a critical impact on results. 
Under the EA scenario, overall market value losses 
of the investment portfolio from gradual climate 
policy implementation remain limited to below 
-2 percent in 2031. This is largely determined 
by muted impacts on fixed income investments, 
by far the largest exposure in the portfolio. 
In comparison, real assets suffer somewhat higher 
losses on a standalone basis but contribute less 
to overall market value losses due to a lower 
share in the portfolio. This picture changes 
when moving forward to 2050, where overall 
market value losses increase in the order of -10 
percent. Substantially higher long-term interest rates in 2050 relative to 2031 drive losses from 
fixed income investments above losses from real 
assets, especially affecting valuations of long-
dated bonds held for liability matching purposes. 
Real estate prices decline further, driven by costs 
of energy efficiency improvements. 
The disruptive onset of climate policy 
implementation under the LA scenario in 2031 
causes a contraction of the overall economy 
entailing immediate market value losses 
of the investment portfolio of close to -10 
percent. Impacts are most pronounced for 
real assets, where a rise in risk premia adds to 
direct consequences from transition policies on 
emissions intensive sectors. Credit spreads rise 
substantially for the same reason, driving losses 
from fixed income investments. Economic recovery 
by 2050 and progress made in transitioning to 
low-carbon production reduces market value 
losses for equity and alternative investments 
relative to 2031, whereas losses on real estate 
investments increase above 2031 levels, 
similar to the EA scenario. While credit spreads 
tighten by 2050, higher long-term interest rates 
increase losses from fixed income investments 
as compared to 2031, entailing about -12 
percent market value losses of the overall 
investment portfolio. 
Under the NAA scenario, the investment portfolio 
experiences minor market value losses of 
roughly -3 percent in 2050 resulting from a loss 
of economic production due to global warming. 
Substantially more severe consequences across all 
asset classes are predicted for late in the century. 
  For our strategic response to identified risks 
please see 04.4.6.04.4.4 Bottom-up quantitative 
carbon stress-test for investments
This year, we publish the results of our second 
assessment modeling carbon risks for our 
investment portfolio using a bottom-up approach. 
In 2020, we started with listed equity and we have 
now also included corporate bonds. This stress-
test complements top-down approaches such as 
those put forward by financial markets regulators. 
We see merit in a model which gives us full 
transparency on methods and parameters, is easy 
to implement and gives a first understanding of 
the evolution of potential climate impacts on our 
portfolio. It also provides opportunities to cross-
check external methodologies and potentially 
develop more elaborate models going forward. 
Methods, assumptions and limitations
Our approach uses effective carbon prices as 
a proxy for policy intensity, e.g. actual carbon 
pricing, energy-related subsidies and incentives, 
standards for energy efficiency and emissions. 
The fundamental idea is that an increase in 
emissions price entails a decrease in earnings 
at the level of individual investee companies. 
This decrease in earnings can be translated 
into a stock market value loss based on price-
to-earnings multiples. The model requires 
assumptions, for example on cost pass-through, 
price elasticities and regulatory easing (either 
explicitly or implicitly via effective carbon prices). 
These are kept simple for this first version and will 
need to be further refined moving forwards. Our starting point is the carbon footprint of 
listed equity and corporate bonds portfolios, as 
disclosed in section 04.6 using Scopes 1 and 2 
emission figures. On this foundation, we apply 
carbon price shocks derived from the climate 
scenarios developed by the Network for Greening 
the Financial System (NGFS). Please note that we 
updated the scenarios applied for this analysis 
according to the latest available reference 
scenarios published by the NGFS in 2021.
Under the scenarios, prices materialize over the 
coming ten years and depend significantly on 
intensity of policy action and underlying scenario 
assumptions. The model assumes instantaneous 
change of effective carbon prices applied to the 
portfolio, with no mitigation actions.
To re-emphasize, this version of our assessment 
focuses on listed equity and corporate bonds 
impacts only. It does not account for factors like 
different physical asset bases and resulting lock-
ins, cost pass-through abilities, price elasticities or 
regulatory relief. It also does not yet differentiate 
between Scopes 1 and 2 emissions and, 
importantly, it assumes companies do not respond 
to climate policy trends such as governmental net-
zero strategies by lowering their carbon exposure. 
These factors will be incorporated in future more 
elaborate versions of the assessment. The impacts 
for corporate bonds rely on a high-level estimate 
of the statistical relationship between the 
movements of a corporate bond‘s spread and 
the respective issuer’s equity market value. 01 Introduction

Results 
Absolute emissions are concentrated in 
only a few sectors. At level 2 of NACE sector 
classification, for the listed equity portfolio the 
10 sectors with the highest absolute emissions 
contribute around 82 percent to absolute owned 
emissions in the portfolio, but only 29 percent 
to AuM. Sector concentration is even a bit 
more pronounced in the listed corporate bond 
portfolio where the 10 sectors with the highest 
absolute emissions contribute around 84 percent 
to absolute financed emissions in the portfolio, 
but only 26 percent to AuM.
Consistent with analyses disclosed in previous 
years and with the scoping of this approach, our 
listed equity and corporate bonds portfolios show 
– within the current modeling framework and its 
limitations – sensitivities in those sectors. 
Over the 2031 time horizon, the overall sensitivity 
of the listed equity portfolio stays contained in 
the ‘Below 2°C’ scenario, with market value losses 
between 2.5 percent to 4 percent depending 
on climate-economic model. The consequences 
of more stringent policy reaction and faster 
technology change are reflected in higher 
sensitivities under the 1.5°C-aligned ‘Net-Zero 
2050’ and ‘Divergent Net-Zero’ scenarios, where 
market value losses go up to 9 percent to 11 
percent in the disorderly ‘Divergent Net-Zero’ 
scenario. The carbon price sensitivity in the 
‘Delayed transition’ scenario is still muted relative 
to other scenarios due to delayed policy action 
setting in only after 2030. 04.4  Strategy resilience, stress-tests and climate scenario analysis
In addition to high emitting sectors and issuers, 
duration is another main driver of the carbon price 
sensitivity of the listed corporate bonds portfolio. 
The overall sensitivity is around two times lower 
as compared to listed equity, with market value 
losses going up to 4.0 percent to 4.5 percent under 
the most onerous disorderly ‘Divergent Net-Zero’ 
scenario. This is mainly owing to the limited 
co-movement of corporate bond spreads and 
equity returns observed in historical timeseries 
data which is used in the model to translate 
sensitivities for listed equity into sensitivities for 
listed corporate bonds. 
From 2020 to 2021, the numbers substantially 
decreased as our equity and corporate bonds 
portfolio carbon footprint reduced, see section 
05.6. Looking ahead to 2050, in the absence 
of adaptation or mitigation actions maximum 
carbon price sensitivities under the ‘Divergent Net-
Zero’ scenario could almost triple as compared 
to 2031. 
Being aware of the limitations of our approach, 
the results are still leading us to the right follow-
up questions to understand how carbon price 
increases can affect different sectors and which 
parameters of individual investee companies will 
lead to a non-uniform development inside a given 
sector as not all will be affected equally. This holds 
especially true as major carbon emitters are often 
exempted from carbon pricing schemes due to 
carbon leakage risks.
Our strategic response to carbon risks is our long-
term commitment to our intermediary portfolio 
targets made as part of the U.N.-convened Net-
Zero AOA. See section 04.4.6 for further details. -16% -14% -12% -10% -8% -6% -4% -2% 0%

04.4.5 Bottom-up quantitative 
physical risk analysis for 
P&C insurance
To be able to assess physical climate risk exposure 
for investments and insurance, Allianz Reinsurance 
has initiated the Allianz Climate Change Risk 
Score (ACCRiS) project. The project will allow 
Allianz to understand the physical climate change 
risk at single location for a number of perils under 
a variety of climate scenarios and time horizons.1
Methods, assumptions and limitations
Integration of climate model data into the existing 
Allianz global hazard layers provides the basis 
for the tool. The available outputs are hazard, 
risk and financial impact metrics for current and 
future climate. For the estimation of risk under 
climate change, numerous climate model outputs 
are used for each peril, climate change scenario 
and time horizon combination, allowing for the 
accounting of the uncertainty in the predictions.
Results of the first two perils provided to the 
business were inland flood and tropical cyclone. 
The climate change risk for the key insurance 
portfolios exposed to either peril was analyzed. 
An estimation of the impacts of climate 
change for inland flood and tropical cyclone, 
including identification of risk clusters, under the 
RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios in 2030 and 2050 
was made for each individual policy for tens of 
millions of insured objects.Results
For inland flood, portfolios from 24 Allianz P&C 
Insurance operating entities were analyzed. 
There is a clear trend that inland flood risk will 
increase for the entire Allianz portfolio, with higher 
emissions scenarios having a larger impact. 
Locations in Western Europe were identified 
as driving the increasing risk. On an individual 
Allianz operating entity basis, the trends can 
differ, with entities in Mediterranean climates 
exhibiting decreasing or stable flood risk due 
to more extreme and prolonged droughts. 
However, there are large uncertainties in the level 
of increase of inland flood risk across the different 
climate models. There are opportunities to reduce 
flood risk under climate change, which are not 
directly reflected in the analysis. For example, 
Allianz can educate customers to make them 
more flood-resilient, governments can improve 
flood defenses, and the construction industry can 
select the flood resilient building materials and 
designs for high risk locations.
For tropical cyclones, North America and Australia 
were analyzed. In general, climate change is 
expected to amplify the tail risk due to an increase 
in the frequency of high-intensity tropical cyclones. 
Regions with historically low risk will see a higher 
frequency of tropical cyclones (northern US 
Atlantic coast and southern Australian east coast). 
While the difference between emission scenarios 
is low in the short-term up to 2030, opposing 
influences and limitations in the ability of climate 
models to simulate tropical cyclones makes 
projections in the second half of the century 
increasingly uncertain.04.4  Strategy resilience, stress-tests and climate scenario analysis

Outcomes from this analysis are to inform a 
forward-looking view on the risk-adequate price 
for Allianz P&C insurance entities. By the end of 2022, additional perils and climate scenarios 
(including RCP 2.6) will be finalized and analyzed 
for the insurance and investment portfolios to 
ensure a truly Allianz view of physical climate 
change risk.
1 Two perils, inland flood and tropical cyclone are already implemented and assessment of physical climate change risk for every single global location can be provided. 
Next perils to be implemented are: hail and costal flood, additional perils to come in line with business requirements. Scenarios used are RCPs 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5. RCPs are 
scenarios that describe alternative trajectories for greenhouse gas emissions and the resulting atmospheric concentration from 2000 to 2100. The scenarios are based on 
different assumptions about population, economic growth, energy consumption and sources, and land use over this century. The scenarios are named after the level of 
‘radiative forcing’ that each scenario produces (measured in Watts per square meter).Allianz climate change risk scores applied to real estate
For the proprietary investment portfolio, a pilot study was conducted applying the ACCRiS method introduced in 
section 04.4.5 for the estimation of flood climate change risk to the Allianz Real Estate global direct portfolio.
For every real estate location, the impact of all perils was analyzed under current climate. For the most relevant 
peril – inland flood – an estimation of the impacts of climate change, including identification of risk clusters 
under the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios in 2030 and 2050, was made.
The analysis found that most properties are not located in high-risk floodplains but there is a clear trend that 
inland flood risk will increase with higher emissions scenarios for those investments most at risk of inland 
flooding. Locations in Western Europe were identified as driving the increasing risk, where there is a noticeable 
difference in frequency of flooding if we compare the current climate to 2030/2050.

Outcomes from the pilot project enable informed investment decision making processes, optimizing 
future portfolio allocations accounting for climate change, and identification of asset locations where 
adaptation measures should be evaluated to ensure minimal impacts of flood events. By the end of 
2022, we expect to add additional perils and analyze other kinds of investments (e.g. infrastructure).

05 Our universal principles04.4.6 Strategic response to 
identified carbon risks  
The impacts of transition risk scenarios on the 
investment portfolio discussed in sections 04.4.1, 
04.4.3, and 04.4.4 appear to be manageable 
considering both the magnitude of predicted 
losses and the time horizon over which they 
materialize. Extending this analysis to a full 
balance sheet view, including mitigating effects 
from insurance liabilities, would further support 
this assessment – for example accounting for the 
offsetting of fixed-income losses from increasing 
long-term interest rates by lower long-term 
liabilities from life insurance under the EA and 
LA CBES scenarios. Moreover, the investment 
portfolio will not remain static. Instead inter- and 
intra-sector asset allocation will be adapted 
dynamically to limit the identified transition 
risk exposure. Effective mitigation, however, 
requires long-term action to align the portfolio 
with policy targets.
Reports like the U.N. Emission Gap Report show 
that the world is currently on a 2.7°C pathway 
meaning decisive and credible measures 
from all groups of actors are needed urgently. 
Our strategic response to carbon risks is our 
long-term commitment to decarbonize our 
investment and insurance portfolios to net-
zero GHG emissions by 2050, consistent with a 
maximum temperature rise of 1.5˚C above pre-
industrial temperatures. As founding member to the U.N.-convened Net-
Zero (AOA), we have set intermediary investment 
portfolio targets. The work of the AOA is done 
in collaboration and with a collective ambition, 
bringing together global investors, leading civil 
society, academia, and the leadership of the 
U.N. The AOA remains the first and only group of 
financial sector global players to set 2025 interim 
targets across four areas: sub-portfolio targets 
(at asset class level); sector targets; engagement 
targets and financing targets. The purpose of 
these targets is to drive decarbonization of real 
economy towards 1.5°C. (see section 04.6.1 
on investment portfolio targets). With regard 
to target implementation, both the top-down 
and bottom-up approaches for investments 
included in this report support our view that 
sector pathways such as those being developed 
in the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net-Zero 
and assessing companies transition plans along 
these pathways is the way to go as we want to 
finance the transition and not divest from high 
emitting sectors. 
While increasing the resilience of our portfolio 
against the transition risks, for example as 
exemplified in the EA and LA CBES scenarios 
over the short- to mid-term in section 04.4.3, 
our decarbonization strategy also contributes to 
limiting the physical risks showcased in the NAA 
CBES scenario, which may materialize in our 
portfolio over the long-term.

05 Our universal principlesThe risks and opportunities 
posed by climate change require 
the use and regular review of 
our comprehensive framework 
to ensure it is properly addressed 
and applied. 
04.5.1 Overarching risk 
governance 
Climate change risks and adaptation to the 
resulting impacts have been integral to our risk 
management process for many years and our 
approach continues to improve. All processes 
and rules are codified in the Allianz Standards 
and Functional Rules. Compliance with these 
rules is mandatory. Our risk management 
and adaptation processes and rules cover all 
insurance and underwriting-specific processes. 
Climate risks are addressed as part of an 
overarching qualitative and quantitative risk 
reporting and controlling framework:
• As a general principle, responsibility for the 
‘First Line of Defense’ rests with business 
managers in the related Allianz Group 
undertaking. They are responsible for the risks 
taken and the returns from their decisions. 
• The ‘Second Line of Defense’ consists of 
independent global oversight functions 
– Risk, Actuarial, Compliance and Legal. 
These support the Group Board of 
Management in defining the risk frameworks 
within which the business can operate.• Group Audit forms the ‘Third Line of Defense’, 
independently and regularly reviewing risk 
governance implementation and compliance 
with risk principles, performing quality reviews 
of risk processes, and testing adherence to 
business standards, including the internal 
control framework. 
Early warning indicators are monitored and 
regularly reported to senior management through 
risk dashboards, risk capital allocation and limit 
consumption reports to identify when climate 
aspects become material. Supplemented by 
quarterly updates, senior management decides 
the risk management strategy and related actions.
A key tool is the Allianz Risk Capital Model which 
assesses natural catastrophe events for the 
upcoming year on subsidiary and Group level. 
Another important instrument is the yearly Top 
Risk Assessment which helps to identify and 
remediate significant threats to financial results, 
operational viability, reputation and delivery of 
strategic objectives, regardless of whether they 
can be quantified or not. This includes immediate 
risks for the company and emerging risks which 
may arise from technological developments, 
new or changing environmental risks and socio-
demographic changes. Climate-related factors 
are included in Top Risk Assessments which are 
conducted at both operating entity and Group 
level. Relevant emerging risks are discussed by 
the Group Finance and Risk Committee or the 
Group Underwriting Committee. Following that, 
underwriting opportunities or mitigation measures 
are implemented where necessary.
  For more details on these risk management 
processes please see the Risk and 
Opportunity Report on pages 97 – 115 of 
the Allianz Group Annual Report 2021.04.5.2 Natural catastrophe 
risk governance
The Group-wide risk management framework is 
applicable to Natural Catastrophes (Nat Cat).  
Very specific processes and rules apply to 
the management of Nat Cat risks due to the 
significance of relevance and potential exposure. 
Main risk management processes covering 
physical climate change adaptation include 
pricing risks, portfolio management, exposure and 
risk management, risk consulting, claims handling 
and governance.
Each operating entity is responsible for controlling 
its exposure to individual catastrophes and for 
defining local reinsurance requirements based 
on local risk appetite and capital position. 
The respective cover is provided by Allianz SE 
or one of its subsidiaries. 
At Group level, the Board of Management reviews 
and approves the risk appetite. The reinsurance 
division is responsible for designing and 
implementing Group catastrophe protections 
within given exposure limits. These covers take 
various forms and aim to protect the Group 
against excessive losses from major natural 
catastrophes. We measure, monitor and steer 
risk based on an approved internal model which 
quantifies the potential adverse development 
of own funds. All relevant P&C insurance and 
reinsurance portfolios are considered.We use special Nat Cat modeling techniques 
which combine portfolio data (e.g. geographic 
location, characteristics of insured objects and 
their values) with simulated natural disaster 
scenarios to estimate the magnitude and 
frequency of potential losses. Where such models 
do not exist, we use deterministic, scenario-based 
approaches to estimate potential losses.
Experts at Allianz Reinsurance – including 
meteorologists, hydrologists, geophysicists, 
geographers and mathematicians – model 
around 50 Nat Cat scenarios for Allianz Group. 
Data is captured using best-in-class standards 
to map a range of perils and regions. In past 
years, these were used to conduct stress-tests 
for floods in Germany as well as wildfires in the 
U.S. and Australia. The results provide the basis 
for group-wide risk monitoring, risk limits and 
subsequent business decisions. The top three 
perils contributing to Nat Cat risk for Allianz Group 
in the past four years were windstorms in Europe, 
floods in Germany and earthquakes in Australia. 
We also conduct selected stress-scenario 
analysis on Nat Cat risks like hail or windstorms 
to be used in risk steering. Nat Cat models are 
regularly updated according to the latest scientific 
information. We are continuously improving the 
inclusion of global Nat Cat hazard information, 
including climate, into underwriting decisions.

04.5.3 Climate and sustainability-
related risk governance 
In addition to addressing climate-related risks 
as part of our overarching qualitative and 
quantitative reporting and controlling framework, 
a variety of comprehensive policies and processes 
foster integration of climate-related risks 
and opportunities. 
The Allianz sustainability approach integrates 
climate- and sustainability-related considerations 
by applying Group-wide corporate rules and 
sustainability instruments across all underwriting 
and investment activities. This includes the 
Allianz ESG Functional Rule for Investments and 
the Allianz Standard for Reputational Risk and 
Issues Management which establish a core set of 
principles and processes for the management of 
reputational risks and sustainability issues within 
the Group. 
All rules and standards are regularly updated 
to reflect newest insights and external 
developments. The publicly-available third 
edition of the Allianz ESG Integration Framework 
increases transparency around internal processes 
and guidelines related to our sustainability 
approach. We also rely on external providers 
for data related to climate, sustainability and 
reputational risks.
As an additional layer, the Climate Integration 
team within Global Sustainability and the 
sustainability Task Forces ensure the early 
identification, measurement and business 
integration of risks and opportunities arising 
from physical climate change and the low-
carbon transition. Examples include regulatory activity around climate change and sustainable 
finance, integration of sustainability and 
climate considerations in business processes, 
and dedicated projects. Substantial topics are 
channeled to the Sustainability Board to inform 
strategic decision-making. 
Risk and opportunity considerations are 
supplemented by additional processes including:
• The annual Allianz Risk Barometer produced 
by Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty. 
This is a survey of corporate clients, brokers, 
industry trade organizations, risk consultants, 
underwriters, senior managers and claims 
experts, in total collecting more than 2,650 
responses from 89 countries and 22 industry 
sectors. Climate change is ranked sixth. It is 
also linked to Nat Cat risks in third position, 
as a key risk to property business, and gains 
increasing importance in shaping emission-
intensive industries in terms of transition risks. 
Business interruption is ranked second highest, 
behind cyber incidents, with potential triggers 
found in climate-related events. 
  You can access the full Risk Barometer here.
• The Global Claims Review analyzes more 
than 470,000 claims in over 200 countries 
and territories. The latest Review from 
2019 found windstorms as the only Nat Cat 
event to appear in the top 10 causes of loss. 
Natural catastrophes account for five percent 
of claims in number and 13 percent of total 
value of all claims. It represents some of the 
largest exposures to energy as well as property 
and engineering segments. Environmental and 
climate change-related liability issues are seen 
to potentially increase in future. • Our partnership and memberships as 
described in section 05.3 facilitate early 
risk detection as well as access to industry 
discussions and best practice.
• Our regular materiality assessment ranks 
emerging sustainability and climate 
issues and opportunities according to 
their importance for our business and our 
stakeholders. See section 05.3.
• Ongoing dialogue with internationally 
recognized non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs) provides ad hoc and scheduled 
exchanges on sustainability matters. The NGO 
dialogue is a forum for direct exchange of 
ideas and points of view designed to leverage 
NGO’s expertise on climate and sustainability 
matters to support the development 
and implementation of internal policies, 
programs and plans. Allianz listens to the 
concerns of NGO partners and discusses 
potential solutions to address these concerns. 
• Ongoing dialogues with policymakers, 
regulators and academia on key economic, 
governmental, environmental and societal 
issues, including climate change, to anticipate 
arising developments and share opinions, 
knowledge and best practice.
For proprietary investments, the ESG Functional 
Rule for Investments provides the foundation for 
integrating climate-related issues.
  For more details on our activities as 
a sustainable insurer and investors, 
see sections 02.1 and 02.2.04.5.4 Risk management 
processes
Methods of adaptation to climate change 
risks form part of our overall risk management 
approach and apply to the whole value chain of 
our insurance operations, covering all business 
segments, lines of business, new business and 
in-force business. Relevance of climate change 
impact and need for adaptation vary across 
our portfolios.
Insurance-related processes
Product development, risk models and tariff 
calculations reflect expected claims from natural 
catastrophes, especially in Property, Engineering 
and Motor insurance. In risk segments and lines 
of business where significant impact from climate 
change cannot yet be observed, risk patterns and 
their development are monitored closely (e.g. 
liability). Coverages and terms and conditions 
are designed with respect to changing risk 
patterns, taking all relevant developments into 
account. Terms and conditions and tariffs provide 
incentives for customers to protect the insured 
assets against natural hazards and other climate-
related risks, where relevant. 
In distribution, consulting and advising customers 
on their risks, based on a thorough individual 
risk assessment, is an integral part of our sales 
strategy in retail and commercial business. For our 
commercial business, the sales organization is 
supported by underwriters and risk engineers who 
provide specific advice to customers on protection 
and adaptation measures against all types of 
risk, especially Nat Cat and other climate change-
related risks.04.5 Risk and opportunity management

In underwriting, a thorough rules-based risk 
assessment is performed prior to any underwriting 
decision, either automated (mostly in retail 
business) or individually (mostly in commercial 
business). Risk information is captured and stored 
in our database and linked to all relevant business 
processes. For Nat Cats, our Group Global 
Geographic Information System (GIS) combines 
single risk information with global natural hazard 
maps. This is key to managing risk exposure and 
accumulation risk. We have established a limit 
system for each Nat Cat loss type at all levels of 
the organization, including Nat Cat limits at Group 
and operating entity levels. In the commercial 
business, underwriters and risk engineers consult 
and advise customers on prevention measures 
and support them in adapting to changing risk 
patterns. Our re-insurance structure protects our 
capital base against volatility and impact beyond 
defined thresholds. 
In portfolio management, regular performance 
assessments are conducted by operating entities 
and at least twice per year for all relevant 
portfolios together with the responsible Group 
Center of Allianz SE. Any departure from 
projected plans – including claims frequency and 
severity – is identified and action immediately 
taken. As our policies are renewed on a yearly 
basis, actions can be implemented annually if 
necessary. Adaptation measures with regards to 
climate change risks comprise re-pricing actions, 
deductibles, changes in terms and conditions and 
even cancellation of policies where a sufficient 
premium for the risk cannot be obtained. 
  For further details, please refer to the Risk 
and Opportunity report page 97 to 115 of our 
Group Annual Report 2021.Investment-related processes
Comprehensive climate risk management 
processes cover all major asset classes:
• Climate scenarios are analyzed by inter-
departmental teams under the joint lead of 
the AIM Risk and Investment Analytics and AIM 
ESG teams. 
• Both physical and transition risks are assessed 
based to a large extent on quantitative KPIs, 
making use of the climate stress-tests discussed. 
• Risks are actively managed for the total 
portfolio, supported by our ESG-scoring 
approach (see section 02.2). 
• On physical risks, we seek to identify potential 
impacts on physical assets we own, as well 
as impacts on client or investee level and 
associated portfolios (see section 04.4.5).
• Maintaining active dialogue with asset 
managers and investee companies on 
climate strategies integrates into risk 
management framework.Measures to manage our risks are based on two 
major levers:
1. Adapt asset allocation:
• Shift volumes towards zero carbon assets 
(mid-term).
• Increase exposure to companies leading the 
transition (all sectors).
• Increase of blended finance volumes.
• Reduce exposure to climate laggards 
per sector.
• Fossil fuel policy.
2.  Enhance climate change readiness of 
existing assets:
• Broad engagement, bilateral dialogue and 
participation in global initiatives like CA100+ 
or IIGCC. 
• Real Estate: Steer and align real estate portfolio 
with CRREM pathways (1.5˚C pathway).
• Reduce emissions in line with IPCC pathways 
for infrastructure portfolio.
• For physical assets with direct material 
ownership like real estate and infrastructure, 
dedicated asset-level adaptation plans are 
implemented based on thorough location-
sharp physical risk assessments.
• The Allianz Climate Change Risk Score 
(ACCRiS) tool (see section 04.4.5) will 
be used for new acquisitions and for 
portfolio assessment.
• The energy sector is covered by the AOA-
related sector targets for Utilities and Oil 
and Gas.
• Dedicated asset manager engagement is 
in place.04.5 Risk and opportunity management

Carbon footprint methodology
We disclose carbon footprint information of 
our listed equity and corporate bonds portfolio. 
We provide both general portfolio indicators 
and emission-related indicators. We expect to 
enhance this disclosure in upcoming reporting 
cycles in light of the expansion of asset classes 
covered by our AOA commitment, i.e. real estate, 
infrastructure and sovereign bonds.Methodology and Scope
The portfolio carbon footprint for listed equity and 
corporate bonds is calculated based on the following 
measures for Scopes 1 and 2 emissions in line with 
the GHG Protocol. The required data is sourced from 
MSCI and Refinitiv.

cash and cash equivalents held by the enterprise.
Due to regulatory requirements, we changed the

In case of this year’s report, this means that emission data is largely comprised 
of data from FY 2020, as FY 2021 data will only be made available by 
investees in the first half of 2022.01 Introduction

05 Our universal principlesInvestment portfolio carbon footprint
Both our listed equity and corporate bonds 
portfolio have undergone considerable changes 
in the two past years, characterized by the 
economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic 
and the first impacts of our portfolio steering 
towards the climate targets.
Since 2019, we achieved a reduction of absolute 
emissions of almost 25 percent. This was driven 
by four major factors: a COVID-19 effect on 
emissions, change in company valuation which 
impacts the denominator, portfolio changes, 
and structural emission reductions of our investee 
companies. The latter is the real-economy change 
we are seeking and it contributes significantly 
to the emissions reductions we observed. 
Our absolute carbon footprint may rebound next 
year to a certain extent, but what is important for 
us is that the underlying structural trend is intact 
and enables to achieve our target in 2025. 
Sectorally, considerable shares of our equity and 
bond portfolios are invested in manufacturing 
companies. The absolute emissions of manufacturing 
make up 45 percent of our emissions in both asset 
classes. Therefore, we also display NACE level 2 
sectors for manufacturing to further disaggregate 
the sector figures.The past two years showed why we believe 
that both absolute and relative indicators are 
necessary to measure the carbon performance 
of portfolios. Relative indicators are sensitive 
to changes in either direction in both company 
valuation and company sales, whereas absolute 
emissions are sensitive to strategic asset 
allocation shifts.
It should also be noted that our current emission 
Scope is 1 and 2 and does not consider emissions 
in the wider value chain of investees, which can 
be significant for many sectors. While data quality 
for Scope 3 emissions is still low, there is merit 
in sector-specific Scope 3 indicators and data 
to determine if companies and their products 
are on a pathway consistent with our 1.5°C 
ambition. We are working to develop these 
indicators also as part of our work with the AOA. 
We are also calling for harmonized carbon 
disclosure requirements across all three scopes 
of greenhouse gas emissions (see section 04.3.3).
Please note that figures for financial year 
2020 have been restated due to a change 
in methodology.

1 The number of issuers in 5 sectors with highest owned absolute emissions in equities portfolio increased significantly compared to previous year reporting, mainly due to the generation of carbon footprint report using the NACE sector. Moreover, a considerable 
share of equity portfolio is invested in manufacturing sector, resulting in large numbers of issuers in scope.
2 These four NACE level 1 sectors comprise the majority of our listed equity absolute owned emissions. We decided to further break down the manufacturing sector to the most impacted NACE level 2 sectors as it alone accounts for a material part of the emissions. 04.6  Targets and metrics

05.2 How we report: transparent reporting, ratings and performance
To increase trust and 
transparency in our activities, 
we aim to reflect our values 
of integrity, competence and 
resilience in our sustainability 
reporting. We actively promote 
the development of global 
sustainability reporting 
standards to simplify the 
reporting landscape and 
drive transparency and 
comparability of corporate 
reporting and performance.
Allianz bases its management approach and 
reporting on voluntary international standards 
and guidelines such as the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI) and recognized sustainability 
indices. We continually monitor developments in 
reporting standards and regulations including 
initiatives by the World Economic Forum (WEF), 
the European Commission (EC), the Sustainability 
Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the 
International Sustainability Standards Board 
(ISSB). Our engagement aims to support the 
development of a high-quality and globally 
consistent reporting system that adequately 
meets stakeholders’ information demands in a 
timely manner. For example, we are a member 
of the European Financial Reporting Advisory 
Group (EFRAG) Project Task Force on European 
Sustainability Reporting Standards (PTF-ESRS).  Details on our reporting standards, scope and 
materiality can be found in section 05.2.
  Our annual U.N. Global Compact (UNGC) 
Communication on Progress can be found on 
our website and the UNGC website.
  Our GRI Content Index is available on 
our website.
World Economic Forum Stakeholder 
Capitalism Metrics
In January 2021, Allianz became one of the initial 
endorsing companies of the (WEF) Stakeholder 
Capitalism Metrics. Drawn from existing 
standards, the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics 
are a set of metrics that can be reported on by 
all companies, regardless of industry or region. 
We actively encourage our stakeholders and 
business partners to consider adopting the WEF 
metrics in their own reporting. 
As part of our commitment to transparent 
and comparable reporting, we have included 
an overview of our disclosures based on the 
Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics in this report. 
We have included additional indicators on direct 
economic value generated and distributed. 
The remaining indicators will be published in our 
2022 report. We do not consider some metrics 
to be material for us as a financial services 
company and explanations for these omissions 
are provided.
  Our WEF Content Index available as an 
appendix to this report, is accessible through 
our website.
  For further details on the Stakeholder 
Capitalism Metrics, please see the 
WEF website.Non-Financial Statement

To make a positive impact on 
society, we need to understand 
and respond to the changing 
context in which we operate. 
Our materiality assessment 
enables us to stay on top of 
trends and align our approach, 
reporting and strategy with 
the sustainability issues that 
are most important to our 
stakeholders and our business.
Our materiality assessment helps to ensure that 
we focus on the risks, opportunities and issues that 
matter most to our key stakeholders, and which 
we have the ability to influence. Our most recent 
assessment was carried out in 2021 in line with the 
2020 GRI Standard requirements. Our assessment 
approach used a variety of data sources and we 
improved our methodology in 2021 by increasing 
the number of data sources and the number of 
data points within these sources. 
We created an internal expert pool with 
representatives from Group functions including 
Group Risk, Communications, Group Compliance, 
Group Legal, Group Accounting and Reporting, 
as well as Global Sustainability. This pool was 
formed at an early stage to discuss the overall 
approach, preliminary results and feedback. 
Final results were presented and agreed to by the 
Group centers which had also been part of the 
expert pool. Operating entities – including PIMCO, AIM, Allianz 
Technology, AGCS, AllianzGI – were involved in 
providing feedback on the most material issues 
from their expert perspectives. 
Materiality assessment process:
1. Identification: We identified a list of 
sustainability topics tailored to our business 
through a desk-based review of sourcing 
including our own prior material topics, 
peers’ materiality matrices, a media review 
using the HLG Brand Pressure Index and 
RepRisk data and independent expert opinion 
from a specialist consultancy. 
2. Prioritization: We engaged with stakeholders 
including NGOs, employees and customers 
through interviews, surveys and workshops to 
prioritize the list of material topics. 
3. Analysis and validation: We aggregated 
and analyzed data, integrating the results 
into a materiality map, and presented results 
to the internal expert pool of representatives. 
This group also provided the final judgment 
of outcomes.
Understanding stakeholder views
The views of stakeholders were collected during 
the identification and prioritization phases 
on two aspects: the importance of topics to 
society (encompassing economic, societal and 
environmental aspects) and the importance of 
topics to the Allianz business (including potential 
impact on our business). The data was integrated 
into an independent, third-party analysis model 
which weighs different inputs and maps the 
results. The result is an overall prioritization 
outcome along the two axes of importance to 
society and to Allianz as a business. Input was 
collected from the following stakeholders: Peer companies: We conducted a peer 
assessment of the nine best performing 
companies in terms of materiality analysis in the 
latest Dow Jones Sustainability Index assessment. 
This helped us understand the material issues 
defined by these insurance companies in their 
sustainability reports.
Media: We used the HLG Brand Pressure 
Index and RepRisk data to identify the most 
relevant topics for the financial sector from a 
media perspective.
NGOs: We performed external stakeholder 
interviews with NGOs and complemented it by 
using SigWatch data to identify the most relevant 
topics for NGOs.
Employees: We conducted a series of semi-
structured interviews with 36 internal leaders 
and a workshop with subject matter experts to 
gather insights on Allianz’s key business drivers, 
objectives and priorities. Through our internal 
communications, we conducted a survey of Allianz 
employees worldwide to gather their perspectives 
on the most relevant topics.
Customers: We analyzed multiple reports based 
on customer surveys and engagements from 
various lines of business including property and 
casualty, life & health, and investment.
Sustainability rating agencies: We carried out 
a review of internal documents from selected 
key ratings for Allianz to identify the most 
relevant issues.01 Introduction

05.3  Materiality
Our material issues
Our assessment identified 19 material issues 
which were prioritized as either having high or 
medium importance. Topics are ranked and 
presented in a materiality matrix along two 
axes according to stakeholder views on their 
importance to society and to our business.
All topics in the materiality matrix relate to 
sustainability and several are linked to our 
sustainability strategy pillars, including:
E: Our climate approach – climate change, 
environmental footprint in our operations.
S: Our social approach – financial inclusion, 
local community engagement, human rights, D&I.
G: Our approach to sustainability integration 
– ethics and responsible business, data and AI 
ethics, data privacy, cybersecurity, sustainability 
integration into products.
The top three most material issues for all our key 
stakeholders and our business are:

Stakeholder engagement 
and collaboration is crucial 
to understand our impacts 
and drive progress across our 
sustainability challenges and 
opportunities. Understanding 
stakeholder needs enables 
us to design products and 
services that scale our positive 
contribution to tackling 
social, environmental, 
and economic issues.
We use our materiality analysis, customer surveys 
and direct engagement with a diverse range of 
stakeholders to shape our strategy, activities and 
reporting. Besides engagement with international 
and national sustainability bodies and initiatives, 
we focus on four key stakeholder groups which 
are most impacted by our business.Key stakeholder groups Why engagement is important How we engage1

Partnerships for change
We believe collaboration and long-term 
partnerships are instrumental in delivering 
positive change. Addressing global challenges 
like climate change and human rights requires 
collective action involving business, governments 
and civil society. Allianz’s businesses are members 
of a wide range of sustainability-related initiatives 
and principles. 
Building confidence 
in tomorrow… 
…in partnership with the Olympic  
and Paralympic Movements
Allianz officially began its eight-year 
Worldwide Insurance Partnership with the 
Olympic and Paralympic Movements on 
1 January 2021, building on a collaboration 
with the Paralympic Movement since 2006. 
Through the partnership, Allianz is supporting 
athletes as ambassadors, mentors and 
employees and is supporting the Olympic 
and Paralympic Movements with insurance 
solutions and services. Our partnership will 
engage youth with the spirit and values of 
the Movements at Allianz Sports Camps. 
Plus, we have introduced a podcast that will 
put a spotlight on those supporting athletes’ 
mental health. Unlocking barriers for people 
with disabilities is one of the foundations of 
our Corporate Citizenship Strategy. We are 
committed to being an inclusive employer 
and have launched a special focus on hiring 
current and former Para athletes. In 2021, 
five athletes joined Allianz.

05.5 Sustainability governance
We believe in responsible 
and transparent governance 
to enable the creation of 
sustainable value for all 
stakeholders. This extends 
to our governance of 
sustainability issues as we work 
to embed sustainability and 
deliver sustainable outcomes 
across our global business 
and organization.Group Sustainability Board 
As the Group’s parent company, the ultimate 
responsibility for all matters relating to 
sustainability resides with the Board of 
Management of Allianz SE. To support the Board 
of Management in its respective decision-making 
process, Allianz SE has established a dedicated 
Group Sustainability Board (known until January 
2022 as the Group ESG Board) as an advisor on 
all matters around sustainability. It is composed of 
members of the Board of Management of Allianz 
SE and Group Center heads, and meets at least 
quarterly. The core responsibilities of the Group 
Sustainability Board are: 
• Preparing the overall framework for 
sustainability for the Allianz Group.
• Aligning sustainability (ESG) integration 
into the Allianz Group’s business processes 
with Allianz as an organization (operations 
and organization) and Allianz as a 
financial institution (investment, insurance, 
asset management). 
• Related internal and external communication. 
Furthermore, it assumes responsibility for 
the oversight and steering of overarching 
sustainability matters, such as topics concerning 
the climate, society and governance.
The work of the Group Sustainability Board is also 
supported by corporate functions and operating 
entities, which implement sustainability matters in 
their activities.Allianz SE Supervisory Board 
Sustainability Committee 
As a measure to strengthen sustainability 
matters within the Allianz Group, in 2021, the 
Supervisory Board of Allianz SE established its 
Sustainability Committee to oversee sustainability 
issues, to advise the Board of Management 
on ethical standards concerning the usage of 
data (Data Ethics), and to monitor the Board 
of Management’s sustainability strategy. 
It supports with sustainability-related target 
setting and performance reviews for Board of 
Management remuneration.
  Read more about the Sustainability 
Committee and its member here. 
Other Committees
In addition to the Sustainability Committee and 
Sustainability Board, several other committees 
play an important role in Allianz’s decision-
making processes: 
• The Group Finance and Risk Committee 
oversees risk management and monitoring, 
including sustainability risk. 
• The Group Underwriting Committee monitors 
the underwriting business, its risk management 
and development of underwriting policies 
and strategies. This includes the integration 
of sustainability into these processes. 
• The Group Investment Committee focuses 
on fundamental investment-related topics, 
including sustainability-related matters. Linking sustainability performance 
with Board remuneration 
In 2020, the Supervisory Board linked Allianz 
SE Board of Management remuneration to 
specific sustainability targets. Board members’ 
individual contribution factor looked at progress 
towards environmental and net-zero targets 
for proprietary investments and Allianz Group 
operations. In 2021, the variable component 
of Board member’s remuneration (individual 
contribution factor) considered a range of 
sustainability-related targets:
On top of these specific sustainability-related 
targets, other non-financial factors such as 
customer satisfaction (NPS) and employee 
engagement (IMIX) also contribute to Board 
member’s remuneration.

system of Allianz Group, please see the Group

05.5  Sustainability governance
Sustainability management 
On 01 January 2021, responsibility for Allianz’s 
sustainability agenda shifted to a new Global 
Sustainability function, headed by the Chief 
Sustainability Officer (CSO) who reports to the 
Chairperson of the Group Sustainability Board. 
Global Sustainability supports Allianz’s group 
centers and operating entities to effectively 
integrate the Group’s strategic sustainability 
approach and policies into their business 
processes. The function drives the integration of 
sustainability-related matters in the organization 
and business, aiming at Allianz taking a shaping 
role on sustainability in the societies and 
economies Allianz operates in. Responsibility 
for sustainability reporting shifted to Group 
Accounting and Reporting which collaborates 
closely with Global Sustainability to produce 
this report. In June 2021, Allianz created a Sustainable 
Operations function within Group Operations 
and IT. The ambition of the new function is 
to strengthen the sustainability approach of 
Allianz’s operating entities with a primary focus 
on IT infrastructure and applications, facility 
management, procurement and business travel. 
Sustainable Operations monitors and promotes 
the progress of Allianz’s sustainability activities 
in these areas. It also steers and coordinates 
sustainable operations initiatives and enables 
best practice sharing across Allianz entities.
Embedding sustainability 
across our global organization 
We strive towards integration of sustainability in 
every decision made at Allianz. This means that 
all business and support functions, should embed 
sustainability in their strategies and approaches.
To support this ambition, Group Sustainability 
works with an expansive network of sustainability 
experts located across Allianz’s operating entities 
globally. They support the implementation of the 
group-wide sustainability approach and helps 
share best practice and scale positive impacts 
across the organization. The network includes:
• Sustainability Leads responsible for 
coordinating and leading sustainability 
integration in our operating entities; 
• Local Environment Officers responsible for 
managing the environmental footprint of 
our operations; 
• Non-Financial Data Coordinators responsible 
for sustainability reporting;
• Corporate Citizenship Leads who drive CSR 
activities and partnerships; and 
• Sustainability/ESG experts and centers 
of competence in our business functions 
at group-level (P&C, L&H, investments, 
asset management) as well as in our group 
centers (procurement, operations, etc.).01 Introduction

05.8  Independent practitioner’s report 
on a limited assurance engagement 
on sustainability informationRespect for human rights 
is a minimum standard 
for responsible business 
within and beyond our 
direct operations. This is an 
expectation that is reflected 
by expanding legislation 
and applied across our 
global operations.
We are committed to respecting various human 
rights standards and have been a participant 
in the U.N. Global Compact (UNGC) since 2002. 
We annually communicate our progress against 
these principles. 
We aim to identify, prevent, or mitigate adverse 
human rights impacts linked to our business 
activities and operations including our supply 
chain. The U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and 
Human Rights (UNGP) provide a framework for 
responsible business operations and activities. 
  Read our UNGC Communication on Progress.
In the German context, Allianz commits to the 
National Action Plan for Business and Human 
Rights which is based on the U.N. Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights.
To manage our human rights impacts, we must 
look across each of our roles as an insurer and 
investor, as an employer, as a company including 
our supply chain and as a corporate citizen. For 
each of these roles, we have embedded different 
processes to manage human rights risks and act 
on opportunities to drive positive change. In 2021, 
we strengthened our approach by publishing our 
Human Rights Approach embedded in the Allianz 
Group ESG Integration Framework. We continue to apply ESG and Human Rights 
Guidelines for sensitive countries across all 
business lines and core processes dealing with 
insurance, investment, and procurement decisions.
In 2021, we collaborated with a third-party 
consulting company to perform a Human 
Rights Impact Assessment based on UNGP’s 
methodology to identify gaps in our approach 
and continue to improve human rights integration 
in our core business and organization. We will 
continue to work on improvement points based on 
the findings of this assessment. 
  Read the Allianz Group ESG 
Integration Framework.
Integrating human rights  
into our core business
As a corporate insurer and investor, our human 
rights due diligence process forms part of our 
overall sustainability approach which is integrated 
into our broader risk management system (see 
 Table ESG-3). We use a combination of sector 
and country-specific approaches to identify 
human rights risks. 
Human rights-related due diligence has been 
integrated into all 13 sensitive business areas 
where relevant, to ensure that human rights 
are part of the overall risk assessment for 
insurance and investments in non-listed asset 
classes. We maintain a mandatory referral list 
for sensitive countries where systematic human 
rights violations occur. For business transactions 
located in these countries, we carry out explicit 
due diligence in accordance with our Human 
Rights Guideline that covers various human rights 
violations. Additional details on these human 
rights assessments can be found in  Table ESG-3.In terms of our investments, if we identify an 
issuer in our listed investment portfolio that is 
flagged for human rights issues by our external 
sustainability data provider, we prioritize 
this issuer for a systematic engagement 
(see section 02.2).
46
ESG referrals were assessed under the 
human rights guideline in 2021.
Respecting human rights as an employer
We apply the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights as an employer throughout our worldwide 
operations. We have integrated the 10 principles of 
the UNGC into our globally binding Allianz Group 
Code of Conduct and we respect the Organization 
for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.
Allianz endorses the Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work, including the ILO 
declaration on the freedom of association and 
the right to collective bargaining. In countries 
where local law prohibits formalized unions 
and works councils, we respect local law but do 
not obstruct parallel means of association and 
bargaining, and we strive to act in the spirit of the 
UNGC principles.
Our commitment to foster workplace and gender 
equality goes to the core of our commitment as 
an employer. Allianz is a supporter of the U.N. 
Women’s Empowerment Principles and the B 
Team’s Principles for Equality which aim to ensure 
equitable, safe, and dignified workplaces that 
respect human rights and allow people to thrive. We continuously engage with the B Team and 
business across industries to exchange and better 
understand human rights topics.
  For more details on employee rights, 
gender equality and diversity initiatives, 
see section 02.4.
  Read the Allianz Group Code of Conduct.
Respecting human rights in 
our operations
Human rights due diligence in our operations is 
part of our ESG referral and assessment process 
(see section 01.6). For procurement activities, 
a negative answer to human rights-related 
screening questions in the vendor integrity 
screening triggers sustainability assessment at 
Group level. In 2021, we revised this screening 
questionnaire with additional questions. These are 
published in the annex of the Allianz Group 
Vendor Code of Conduct.
We extend our commitment to international 
human rights standards to the workforce of our 
suppliers and those impacted by our supply chain. 
Our Global Sourcing and Procurement function 
assesses current and potential suppliers to ensure 
they abide by the ESG guidelines outlined in the 
Allianz Vendor Code of Conduct (CoC), which is 
aligned with ILO standards, UNGP and UNGC 
(see section 03.6). Allianz is also committed to 
compliance with the Modern Slavery Act in the 
U.K., both from the perspective of our U.K. business 
and the interactions of our wider Group. No issues 
were raised regarding human rights issues in 
accordance with the Modern Slavery Act in 2021.

on a limited assurance engagement 
on sustainability informationTo Allianz SE, Munich,
We have performed a limited assurance 
engagement on the disclosures in the Sustainability 
Report of Allianz SE, Munich (hereinafter: 
‘the Company’), for the period from 1 January to 
31 December 2021 (hereinafter: ‘Report’). 
Responsibilities of the 
Executive Directors
The executive directors of the Company are 
responsible for the preparation of the Report 
in accordance with the principles stated in the 
Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global 
Reporting Initiative (hereinafter: ‘GRI-Criteria’).
This responsibility of Company’s executive 
directors includes the selection and application of 
appropriate methods of sustainability reporting as 
well as making assumptions and estimates related 
to individual sustainability disclosures, which are 
reasonable in the circumstances. Furthermore, 
the executive directors are responsible for such 
internal control as they have considered necessary 
to enable the preparation of a Report that is free 
from material misstatement whether due to fraud 
or error.
Independence and Quality Control of 
the Audit Firm
We have complied with the German professional 
provisions regarding independence as well as 
other ethical requirements.
Our audit firm applies the national legal 
requirements and professional standards – in 
particular the Professional Code for German 
Public Auditors and German Chartered 
Auditors (‘Berufssatzung für Wirtschaftsprüfer 
und vereidigte Buchprüfer’: ‘BS WP/vBP’ as well as the Standard on Quality Control 1 
published by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer 
(Institute of Public Auditors in Germany; IDW): 
Requirements to quality control for audit 
firms (IDW Qualitätssicherungsstandard 1: 
Anforderungen an die Qualitätssicherung in 
der Wirtschaftsprüferpraxis - IDW QS 1) – and 
accordingly maintains a comprehensive system 
of quality control including documented policies 
and procedures regarding compliance with 
ethical requirements, professional standards and 
applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
Practitioner’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance 
conclusion on the disclosures in the Report based 
on the assurance engagement we have performed. 
Within the scope of our engagement we did not 
perform any procedures on external sources of 
information or expert opinions, referred to in the 
Report. Furthermore, we did not perform any 
procedures on any forward-looking statements 
such as projections and forecasts or on the 
suitability of design or operating effectiveness 
of the processes and activities described in 
chapter ‘Climate-related financial disclosure’ 
of the Report.
We conducted our assurance engagement in 
accordance with the International Standard on 
Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): 
Assurance Engagements other than Audits or 
Reviews of Historical Financial Information, 
issued by the IAASB. This Standard requires that 
we plan and perform the assurance engagement 
to allow us to conclude with limited assurance that 
nothing has come to our attention that causes us 
to believe that the disclosures in the Company’s 
Report for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2021 have not been 
prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance 
with the relevant GRI-Criteria. 
In a limited assurance engagement the assurance 
procedures are less in extent than for a reasonable 
assurance engagement and therefore a substantially 
lower level of assurance is obtained. 
The assurance procedures selected depend on the 
practitioner’s judgment.
Within the scope of our assurance engagement, 
we performed amongst others the following 
assurance procedures and further activities:
• Obtaining an understanding of the structure 
of the sustainability organization and of the 
stakeholder engagement. 
• Inquiries of personnel involved in the preparation 
of the Report regarding the preparation process, 
the internal control system relating to this process 
and selected disclosures in the Report.
• Inspection of processes for collecting, controlling, 
analyzing and aggregating selected data at 
specific sites of the Company.
• Identification of the likely risks of material 
misstatement of the Report under consideration 
of the GRI-Criteria.
• Analytical evaluation of selected disclosures 
in the Report.
• Comparison of selected disclosures with 
corresponding data in the consolidated financial 
statements and in the management report. 
• Evaluation of the presentation of the selected 
disclosures regarding sustainability performance.• Evaluation of the description of the processes 
in place and activities undertaken to apply the 
TCFD Recommendations.
Assurance Conclusion
Based on the assurance procedures performed 
and assurance evidence obtained, nothing has 
come to our attention that causes us to believe 
that the disclosures in the Company’s Report for 
the period from 1 January to 31 December 2021 
have not been prepared, in all material aspects, 
in accordance with the relevant GRI-Criteria.
