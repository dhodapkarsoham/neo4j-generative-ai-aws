CEO MESSAGE
DEAR STAKEHOLDERS,
With more than 18 years at Genuine Parts Company (GPC), I have witnessed the continued 
success of our global Company. However, 2020 tested us with one of the biggest challenges ever. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused tremendous pain and suffering, shutting down our lives 
for an extended period. As we transition to a new normal, we can look back and reflect on the 
adversities we overcame. The challenges we faced in the past year have provided opportunities 
for growth and unity, and we have become more adaptive to change.
Operating as a responsible corporate citizen has always been ingrained in our culture, and this past 
year accentuated the importance of supporting our people and our communities. We have focused 
on the safety and wellbeing of our teammates throughout transitions to working remotely and 
back to the office. Our legacy of giving back took on a new form through virtual volunteering and 
donations to communities and causes that truly make a difference.
We are proud of our teammates for their resilience and contributions to furthering our sustainability 
goals. We are taking steps to reduce the environmental footprint of our operations by reducing 
energy and emissions while increasing recycling opportunities across the globe. This past year, we 
also took further steps to move towards an even more equitable and diverse workplace with the 
hiring of a new Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) Director and the formation of a DE&I Council.
We are proud of the progress we continue to make. For example, we have:
 ▶Reduced our greenhouse gas emissions from utilities 36% from 2018 to 2020.
 ▶Enforced sustainable supply chain policies among our vendors and continued to monitor their 
compliance with our social supply chain expectations.
 ▶Continued our legacy of giving back by donating masks, gloves and more to communities and 
making monetary contributions to worthy causes.
Every day we strive to protect our people and the environment on our continued sustainability 
journey. We want to learn from our stakeholders and encourage your feedback on this 
sustainability update. Please email sustainability@genpt.com to share your ideas and help us 
advance our sustainability progress to make a genuine difference.“Operating as a responsible  
corporate citizen has always been 
ingrained in our culture, and this  
past year accentuated the  
importance of supporting  
our people and our communities.  
We are proud of our teammates for  
their resilience  
and contributions  
to furthering our  
sustainability goals.”

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Our stakeholders consist of many individuals and 
groups across our value chain and beyond who are 
touched by our activities. We actively engage with 
internal and external stakeholders through a variety 
of channels to help us achieve our goal to be a 
world-class service organization.
We strongly believe that the continued success 
of our sustainability programs requires being 
responsive to the feedback from our employees, 
investors, suppliers, partners, communities 
and customers. To jumpstart our sustainability 
programs, we created a comprehensive list of 
potential material topics and included them in 
discussions with key internal stakeholders to get 
feedback on focus areas. We then discussed the 
prioritized topics with GPC management and 
conducted an internal assessment to structure our 
sustainability programs.
To further our sustainability progress in 2020, we 
surveyed our stakeholders to understand their 
perspectives and incorporate their feedback into 
our ESG strategy and decision-making. We used 
their feedback to improve existing programs and 
develop new initiatives. For example, although we 
have upheld human rights since our founding, in 
2020 we formalized our practice and procedures 
into a Human Rights Policy in response to feedback 
from our stakeholders. Additionally, we created and 
shared a formal policy on political contributions. 
To engage with employees, we use the Company’s 
bimonthly newsletter, Aspire, to educate and inform 
them on a wide range of sustainability issues and 
practices.

INTERNATIONAL PROGRESS
GPC Asia Pacific is the largest automotive 
aftermarket parts and accessories supplier in 
Australia and New Zealand, operating under 
Repco and NAPA brands. With hundreds of stores, 
12 advanced distribution centers and 6,200 
employees, GPC Asia Pacific made significant 
sustainability progress in 2020. In addition to 
publishing its ESG  Charter , GPC Asia Pacific 
continued to focus on its Equal Opportunity Policy, 
which ensures all employees have equal opportunity 
in recruitment, promotion, transfer, training,  and 
development. GPC Asia Pacific also developed 
strong ethical sourcing practices focused on 
assessing the risk of modern slavery in the supply 
chain and preventing human rights abuses. In 
addition to requiring that suppliers meet social 
responsibility standards and take corrective action 
when non-compliances are identified, they also have an independent reporting hotline and web 
portal for the anonymous reporting of employee and 
customer concerns. Finally, in 2020 GPC Asia Pacific 
established the GPC Asia Pacific Foundation to play 
a more active role in caring for employee teammates 
and the communities in which they operate. The new 
foundation reflects the strong fundraising and charity 
support of GPC Asia Pacific employees. 
Alliance Automotive Group (AAG), GPC’s automotive 
business in Europe, also made progress in 2020 in the 
ESG areas . With a focus on employee wellbeing, the 
team implemented a number of new initiatives across 
its operations, including a work from home policy to 
accommodate a more flexible work schedule, financial 
wellness training, a partnership with fitness clubs 
for employees to exercise at a reduced cost, and a 
smoking cessation program. Additionally, in response 
to the recent catastrophic flooding in Germany, AAG 
teammates raised essential funds and volunteered 
their time to assist with relief efforts.

SUSTAINING OUR WORKFORCE
GPC is a global Company with a rich blend of people, products and 
services coming together to make a difference in the lives of customers all 
over the world. More than ever before, we rely on the skills of our talented 
and diverse workforce as we pursue our growth objectives, expand our 
offerings and reach our sustainability goals.
EMPLOYEE WELLBEING
GPC promotes a healthy lifestyle and encourages our teammates to 
prioritize their physical, financial and emotional wellbeing. In 2021, we 
expanded our employee wellbeing program to include social wellbeing as 
we look for new and creative ways to connect with each other and support 
our communities. Our program design recognizes that everyone has 
different life goals and there is no one size fits all for total wellbeing. As a 
result, the 2021 program also provided our teammates the ability to select 
from a variety of activities including the ability to make a blood donation, 
complete a financial wellness assessment and enroll in the Livongo® 
Diabetes Management Program so that they could succeed in the areas 
that matter most to them. All employees have access to the wellbeing 
program and a variety of other resources on our GPC wellbeing website.PEOPLE
COVID-19 PROTOCOLS 
We have seen the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic firsthand 
and are committed to the health and wellbeing of our teammates. As the 
pandemic continues to impact our lives, our dedication to the health and 
safety of our employees, customers and communities has not wavered. 
We continuously monitor and follow guidance from the Centers for 
Disease Control (CDC) and enforce enhanced cleaning procedures and 
screening protocols. We provide protective equipment for our teammates  
and regularly employ our emergency relief fund to help those employees 
impacted by COVID-19. Teammates affected by COVID-19 are eligible to 
receive leaves of absence, as well as other forms of aid as support.

GPC is and has always been committed to diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) 
throughout all levels of the organization. Our teammates around the world 
reflect the communities and cultures we serve. We aim to proactively engage, 
understand and draw on a variety of perspectives from individuals. We believe 
in a work environment built on respect, dignity and fairness towards everyone; 
where people feel a sense of belonging, and all voices are welcome and valued. 
We denounce racism and bigotry wherever it exists and support those who 
peacefully further the ideals of inclusiveness, non-violence and equal treatment.
To advance our commitment to DE&I, in 2021 we established a formal Director 
of DE&I position and strengthened our equal employment opportunity policies. 
In addition, we transitioned our DE&I Committee into a formal DE&I Leadership 
Council comprised of representatives from throughout the organization and 
tasked with promoting and advancing qualified individuals of all backgrounds 
and experiences. Going forward, our goal is to increase diversity at all levels, 
from the Board of Directors through management and non-management 
positions, using internal advancement and promotion as well as external 
recruitment, hiring and retention of qualified females and minorities. To attract 
and engage with the next generation of leaders from underrepresented 
groups, we have increased our support for the United Way’s African American 
Partnership (AAP) and Young Professional Leaders (YPL) programs.
“At Genuine Parts Company, we are committed to building the 
highest-performing teams through the power of diversity and inclusion 
while providing equitable growth opportunities to our colleagues 
around the world.
Our integrated approach to diversity, equity and inclusion across 
our key stakeholder group of employees, customers, suppliers, 
shareholders and the communities where we live and work will allow 
us to harness the dynamics of different backgrounds, perspectives and

ENERGY AND EMISSIONS
At GPC, we recognize that our global operational footprint comes with 
tremendous responsibility and opportunity to make a difference. We are 
constantly striving to find new ways to conduct business in a manner that 
protects the environment, conserves natural resources, and complies with 
the laws and regulations that protect our planet.
In 2020, we took further steps to address our two major impact areas— 
energy and fuel consumption. W e recognize that some of the decreases 
in our GHG emissions and energy and water usage over the course of 
2020 likely reflect the impacts of COVID-19 (including travel restrictions, 
populations working from home, and variable utilization of some of our 
facilities). W e have also made strides towards reducing our GHG emissions 
by conserving water and energy resources, reducing waste, and sourcing 
responsibly with vendors that are as equally committed to the protection 
of the environment as we are. In the past three years, we have decreased 
our total GHG emissions from utilities by 36% overall and the emissions 
per reporting site by 62%. Our electricity consumption is down 35% since 
2018, and our gas consumption is down 40%. We are proud to share that 
36% of GPC’s U.S. electricity generation is from renewable energy sources. 
An estimated 10,126,240 pounds of greenhouse gas emissions have been 
avoided since the first solar installation at our North American facilities.PLANET
Alliance Automotive Group - Benelux generates 
sustainable energy from wind turbines to power its 
distribution center.
Looking ahead, we are developing more in-depth reporting 
and emission reduction plans. We recognize that climate 
change is an existential threat globally and are working to 
formalize our approach to reducing carbon emissions. By 
developing a formal emissions reduction plan and climate 
risk management strategy, we aim to set science-based 
reduction targets for carbon emissions.ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION

BUILDINGS
Because GPC facilities account for the vast majority of 
our annual energy usage, we aggressively seek solutions 
to improve energy efficiency in every building we 
operate, with a particular focus on our larger buildings 
like distribution centers and corporate campuses.
As a result of the installation of heating, ventilation and air 
conditioning (HVAC) controls in our stores and distribution 
centers since 2017, we saved 3.92 kilowatt hours (kWh)  
and have prevented the release of 6.18 pounds (lbs) 
of GHG emissions. Light emitting diode (LED) lighting 
retrofits have saved an additional 33.75 kWh and 
55.38 lbs. of GHG emissions. In addition, we utilized 
motion-sensing lighting in our corporate headquarters to 
eliminate unwarranted energy usage.FLEET
Almost three years ago, we began the process of 
developing an electric vehicle (EV) pilot program 
within our automotive business by installing charging 
stations, and officially launched the program in 2020 
with all-electric Chevy Bolts. The Chevy Bolt EV travels 
259 miles per charge, making it an optimal vehicle for 
low-carbon product delivery. Since the inception of this 
program, we have avoided 5,783 lbs of GHG emissions, 
the equivalent of planting 67 trees and letting them 
grow for ten years. Our EV pilot program also provides a 
deeper understanding of the electric vehicle market so 
that our business model can adapt and expand to serve 
new customers.EMPLOYEE AND TEAM TRAVEL
We have begun estimating the emissions associated 
with employee and team travel. With travel limited in 
2020 due to COVID-19, travel-related GHG emissions 
decreased 96%. We hope to maintain a diminished 
travel footprint going forward by using virtual meetings 
and other online technologies for team, supplier, and 
customer collaboration.

WATER CONSUMPTION
GPC is taking steps to do our part to conserve and limit our consumption of 
water. We are proud to share that our water consumption has decreased 
by 38% and gallon per site used has decreased by 67% since 2018, 
thanks to the implementation of water conservation measures. Many of 
our facilities have been updated with low-flow devices and motion-sensing 
fixtures to automatically shut off faucets in kitchens, breakrooms and 
restrooms. We also conduct regular inspections of water lines to identify and 
repair pipe leakage, as well as calibrate our sprinkler usage according to 
rainfall, season and soil type.

PURPOSE
SUSTAINING OUR  
COMMUNITY“Beginning in 1928 with our founder, Carlyle Fraser, GPC has 
always been a huge advocate for giving back to the communities 
we serve. He used to say, ‘if you’re not giving back to the 
community, you’re not doing it right.’ We have continued to honor 
this philosophy over the years through our long-standing tradition 
of community service and active engagement.”

Our most recent addition, Juliette Pryor, joins with extensive experience as

Pryor brings an extraordinary combination of skills and experience that will 
serve the Board, GPC, and our stakeholders well. These recent additions 
bring the total number of directors to 13, 11 of whom are independent, four 
of whom are women, and almost half are diverse.
The Board of Directors receives an ESG update at every Board meeting. 
The Company continues to integrate corporate responsibility and 
environmental stewardship principles, business ethics, and community 
values into our corporate strategy, policies, practices, and procedures.
In 2020, the charter of the Board’s Compensation, Nominating and 
Governance Committee was changed to oversee and guide the strategy 
of the Company’s ESG initiatives, including talent management programs 
and processes. The Committee periodically reviews the Company’s DE&I
