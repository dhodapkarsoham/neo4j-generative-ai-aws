FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
This report contains statements reflecting our views about the future performance of Hostess Brands, Inc. and its subsidiaries (referred to as “Hostess Brands” or the “Company”)

such as “believes,” “expects,” “intends,” “estimates,” “projects,” “anticipates,” “will,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” or similar language. Statements addressing events and developments 
that we expect or anticipate will occur are also considered forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements included herein are made only as of the date hereof.
These statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements. These 
risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our ability to maintain, extend or expand our reputation and brand image; failing to protect our intellectual property rights; 
our ability to leverage our brand value to compete against lower-priced alternative brands; our ability to correctly predict, identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences 
and demand and offering new products to meet those changes; our ability to operate in a highly competitive industry; our ability to maintain or add additional shelf or retail space 
for our products; our ability to continue to produce and successfully market products with extended shelf life; our ability to successfully integrate, achieve expected synergies 
and manage our acquired businesses and brands; our ability to drive revenue growth in our key products or add products that are faster-growing and more profitable; volatility in 
commodity, energy, and  other input prices and our ability to adjust our pricing to cover any increased costs; the availability and pricing of transportation to distribute our products; 
our dependence on our major customers; our geographic focus could make us particularly vulnerable to economic and other events and trends in North America; consolidation 
of retail customers; increased costs to comply with governmental regulation; general political, social and economic conditions; increased healthcare and labor costs; the fact that 
a portion of our workforce belongs to unions and strikes or work stoppages could cause our business to suffer; product liability claims, product recalls, or regulatory enforcement 
actions; unanticipated business disruptions; dependence on third parties for significant services; inability to identify or complete strategic acquisitions; our insurance not providing 
adequate levels of coverage against claims; failures, unavailability, or disruptions of our information technology systems; departure of key personnel or a highly skilled and diverse 
workforce; and our ability to finance our indebtedness on terms favorable to us; and other risks as set forth under the caption “Risk Factors” from time to time in our Securities and 
Exchange Commission filings.
The impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate these risks, any of which could have a material effect on the Company. This situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts 
may arise that the Company is not aware of currently. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on the Company’s behalf are 
expressly qualified in their entirety by these risk factors. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information,

HOSTESS BRANDS, INC. / CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2020/2021 / I. INTRODUCTION /
We are a young company entrusted with a beloved 
101-year-old consumer brand, and we recognized an 
opportunity to build on the strong foundation we have 
established. We resolved to align our activities from 
the Board level to the bakery floor and beyond. Our first 
Corporate Responsibility Report is a tangible effort in our 
journey of transparency and accountability.
Senior management under the direction of our CEO and
CFO formed an Environmental, Social and Governance 
Committee and set about examining all aspects of our 
business. We asked our Nominating and Governance 
Committee to have direct oversight of our ESG efforts. 
The committees and senior management adopted 
a program to report pursuant to the Sustainability 
Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) standards. We 
hired an outside consultant to advise our new ESG 
Committee, talked with our stockholders and set about 
reviewing risks and opportunities material to our 
company. 
 
Over the past couple of years, the Board has focused on 
our governance practices, and we are proud that we are 
now composed entirely of independent Board members 
except for our CEO; we face election each year before 
our stockholders; since last year we have added three 
diverse Board members; we have revised our Code of 
Ethics to better address certain areas of concern from 
a sustainability viewpoint; we have tied our incentive 
compensation for our management team to include 
attainment of sustainability goals and, as noted above,
we added ESG oversight to a committee of the Board. As a Board, we recognize that we are at the beginning 
of the journey of corporate responsibility, but I hope you 
will find this first report informative as we integrate these 
efforts across our daily lives. Thanks for your continued 
interest in Hostess Brands.
Best,
 
JERRY D. KAMINSKI
Chairman of the Board
Hostess Brands, Inc.
On behalf of the Board of Directors of Hostess Brands, 
Inc., thank you for your interest in our company. We are 
committed to operating our business in a sustainable 
manner for all stakeholders as we strive to supply the 
highest quality products to our consumers and retail 
partners.
 
Our Mission is: To inspire moments of joy by putting 
our Heart into everything we do. We strive to live up to 
this mission in a responsible manner while delivering 
industry leading results for our stockholders.
Last year, we met as a Board with our senior management 
team and challenged ourselves with several questions, 
among them: how can we become better corporate 
citizens; how can we transform our operations to be 
more sustainable; how can we operate with a higher and 
more consistent standard of fairness and responsibility 
for our employees and communities, and how can we 
better align our stakeholder interests with our societal 
responsibilities?

I. INTRODUCTION
The Hostess® brand was founded over 100 years ago with 
a simple idea to provide affordable snacks to everyone. 
During the height of the depression, Twinkies® were 
launched to elevate the spirits of the masses when a lift 
was desperately needed.
Much like the iconic squiggle on Hostess’ CupCake, our 
journey at the new Hostess Brands has not been a straight 
line, although the brands created so many years ago have 
endured. At investor day in September 2019, I made a 
commitment to all stakeholders to build a Sustainable 
Profitable Growth Company. Our team has been focused 
on continuing to build on the strong foundation to enable 
continued sustainable growth. This initial ESG report 
is a small but meaningful milestone on this perpetual 
commitment of transparency, focus and continuing 
improvement along this journey.    
At Hostess Brands, we imagine a world where the 
everyday is worth celebrating.  This Vision, although 
lofty, anchors our actions for our Customers, Consumers, 
Suppliers, Investors, Communities and our Hostess 
Heroes, the hardworking men and women we employ who 
make Hostess Brands what it is. Quite simply, at Hostess 
Brands, we inspire moments of joy by putting our HEART 
into everything we do.  Our Heart is on our logo and it is 
in our actions. Putting our Heart into everything includes 
maintaining a responsibility to our consumers. Since 
2018, we have transformed our portfolio to meet
the evolving needs of consumers in a responsible way.
In early 2020, we completed the acquisition of Voortman® Cookies, the leading Sugar Free cookie and 
wafer business in North America. Today, over 80% of the 
Company’s sales are either portion controlled or in a 
Better For You option.
In early 2020, we established an ESG operating structure 
to ensure our corporate responsibility initiatives were 
integrated into our daily operating cadence. To ensure 
we maintained the integrity of this structure, we formed 
an ESG Committee, led by our Chief Administrative 
Officer, reporting to me and our CFO. Board oversight 
of implementation of our ESG initiatives was placed 
with the Nominating and Governance Committee by the 
full board. This structure ensures our overall goals are 
integrated and guided by our corporate responsibility 
commitment. 
HOSTESS IS BECOMING
AN ESG REPORTING 
COMPANY IN 2021.

I. INTRODUCTION
Our commitment and values were tested in early 2020 as we were faced with the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Our quick and decisive actions to keep our team and community 
safe, make meaningful portfolio decisions to support our customers and consumers 
and act to communicate with transparency and integrity has strengthened our 
culture.  Many of these changes will become permanent such as our “Hostess Hero” 
award, community outreach efforts, facility filtration system upgrades, and increased 
sterilization protocols. You can see more of our COVID-19 actions in 2020 on pages 22 
and 23 of this report. 
MOVING FORWARD, WE HAVE AND WILL CONTINUE TO EMBED ESG DRIVEN 
PROCESSES INTO OUR OPERATING PROCEDURES TO ENSURE WE MAINTAIN FOCUS 
AND CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS AGAINST OUR ESG INITIATIVES WITH KEY 
ORGANIZATIONAL DECISIONS WE MAKE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE OR WILL:
· Added sustainability and environmental impact assessments into all capital requests;
· Instituted supplier scorecard reports on environmental impact and fair labor practices; 
· Conducted an employee fair wage analysis and implemented a $15 minimum wage for
all employees;
· Established Diversity, Equity and Inclusion hiring targets at all levels;
· On a quarterly and annual basis, recognize employees for exemplary demonstration of
our Behaviors;
· Integrated Corporate Responsibility Goals in our annual compensation plans for the
Leadership Team;
· Elected an Independent Chairman and assembled a completely independent board
other than myself.I am proud of the commitment we are making to build our business responsibly and 
creating shared values for our Company and society. We are just getting started and will 
continue to be guided by our values as we drive sustainable, profitable growth.
Thanks for your confidence and interest in Hostess Brands,
ANDY CALLAHAN

WHAT WE HEARD & WHAT WE BELIEVE ARE KEY AREAS OF FOCUS
Having conducted our Materiality Assessment, we were informed of many of the 
following areas of interest by key stakeholders and added certain areas we believe are 
important to the Company’s long-term growth and sustainability:
1.     GOVERNANCE
• We heard that governance and oversight by the Board of ESG related matters,
ethics, risk management and Board diversity should be a continuing focus.
2.     HEALTH AND SAFETY
• We heard that our stakeholders were interested in how the Company responded
and is continuing to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and that worker health
and safety is paramount to success. Further, food safety is critical to long-term 
stability and growth.3.     DIVERSITY, EQUITY & INCLUSION
• The past year raised awareness as to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in terms
of company health and long-term sustainability. We heard and recognize that 
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, retention and equitable behavior is foundational to 
our success.
4.     ENVIRONMENTAL
• Many of our stakeholders have been clear that they expect companies to
manage environmental matters and specifically, water usage. We are focused on 
and understand the long-term need to have responsible sourcing of materials
and ingredients.

from the range of threats in today’s world. Our defenses include a 
combination of both active and passive measures that are layered across 
the breadth of our locations. Hostess Brands employs a portfolio of tools 
and services, from industry leading vendors, working in support of each 
other to segment, control, measure, and analyze the activity of users and 
systems on our enterprise networks.

vendors, and team members.  Through our program we continually 
monitor against existing and emerging threats to actively protect our 
environments to ensure continued operation and adhere to privacy 
standards.
Hostess Brands takes the protection of data seriously with collection 
and maintenance of data which would affect our consumers, customers,

HOSTESS BRANDS, INC. / CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2020/2021 / II. GOVERNANCE /The Talent and Compensation Committee is responsible for designing and 
implementing our executive compensation program.
Our compensation philosophy has been established to allow us to attract and retain 
talented senior leaders that can drive business success and create stockholder value. 
Key aspects of the executive pay strategy are to:
• Target an overall compensation level that is competitive in the market (the long-term
intent is generally to pay compensation approximating market median for target pay);
• Emphasize pay for performance with clear objectives and strong alignment between 
results and pay delivered;
• For senior executives, provide a significant focus on long-term performance
achievement that is aligned with stockholder outcomes; and
• Administer all compensation programs in a manner that is consistent and without bias.
The Committee reviews management pay on a total compensation basis with a
stronger focus on pay for performance and creation of stockholder value for members
of senior management.PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION MIX
WE HAVE FOUR ELEMENTS OF TOTAL COMPENSATION:
1 . BASE SALARY
2. SHORT-TERM INCENTIVES
3. LONG-TERM EQUITY INCENTIVES
4. OTHER COMPENSATION BENEFITS (INCLUDING RETIREMENT PROGRAM)  
(A full discussion of our Executive Compensation may be found in the Company’s Proxy.)
Our annual incentive plan contemplates specific goals to be achieved by each 
management team member. Among the goals for 2021 for all senior management 
members is implementation of various ESG related metrics across the Company and 
completion of various ESG inspired initiatives.VIEW THE PROXY HERE

Each of our facilities maintains Hazard Analysis Risk Based Preventive 
Controls (HARPC), also known as a food safety plan, which is reassessed 
annually by the management team at each facility. The food safety plan 
includes a supplier approval program + other food safety controls. Each of our 
facilities also maintains a Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) 
plan, which identifies critical control points per production line. These plans, 
which reduce food safety events and are also reviewed by our 3rd party 
auditors during the annual site assessments. Our employees are trained on 
each program.Our operations, including the manufacturing, processing, 
formulating, packaging, labeling and advertising of products, 
are subject to regulation by various federal agencies, including 
the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the Federal

III. SOCIAL
By any measure, 2020 was a trying year for people across the world. Millions of jobs 
were lost; millions of people lost their lives. COVID hung over every decision every day.
We instituted additional safety protocols, processes, and sanitation measures to protect 
our employees during COVID-19. Even with these additional protocols, some people 
could simply not get comfortable being at the facility and as a result, the Company 
modified its leave policies to accommodate those who would not come to work while 
preserving their jobs for the long term. While all this was happening, the Company 
continued its three year remarkable trend of reducing workplace accidents and lost time 
to rates far better than industry standards.
WE ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE OF 2020, AND WE BELIEVE OUR VALUES 
CARRIED US THROUGH.
Over the last couple years, Hostess Brands has focused on 
making the workplace as safe as it can be. WE are committed 
to continuing our progress to further reduce safety issues in 
the future. This focus and our commitment to worker safety is 
paying off with our Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR) and

For over 100 consecutive days at the beginning of the COVID 
Crisis, a Core Team consisting of our CEO, CAO, SVP Quality, 
SVP Manufacturing, CHRO, VP, Technology, General Counsel 
and VP/HR Manufacturing met to consider the needs of 
our employees and how to operate effectively and safely in 
the COVID environment. This Core team continues to meet 
multiple times a week and this has become a permanent part 
of our response not only to COVID challenges but to health 
and safety concerns of our employees, hiring, retention and 
diversity issues and the impact of a changing environment on

HOSTESS BRANDS, INC. / CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2020/2021 / III. SOCIAL /EMPLOYEES ARE OUR MOST IMPORTANT ASSET AND RETAINING AND 
DEVELOPING EMPLOYEES IS CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY’S SUCCESS.
During 2020, because of demand for our products, employment increased materially 
in two of our facilities, one by over 15% and one by over 40%, and hiring during COVID 
proved challenging. Staffing up and maintaining the workforce was difficult in the 
COVID employment environment.
THE RESULT WAS OUR OVERALL VOLUNTARY TURNOVER RATE INCREASED BY 
ABOUT 3% TO ALMOST 20% DURING 2020.
HOWEVER, AT OUR LARGEST, MOST EFFICIENT FACILITY, TURNOVER DECLINED 
BY 4% YOY.
WE HAVE INSTITUTED SEVERAL INITIATIVES IN OUR FACILITIES TO 
ATTRACT, DEVELOP AND RETAIN A QUALITY WORKFORCE.
• For the last quarter of 2020, we established a more stable work force at our facilities
by enacting various measures as noted below and the effects of working during 
COVID-19 became less of a challenge for employees.
• We instituted additional frontline supervisor training in the 2nd half of 2020, resulting
in more consistent management of our teams.
• We have revamped selection processes to have a better chance of long-term success,
including using a video of “realistic job previews” and use of additional screening tools 
earlier in the application process, which we believe will reduce the incidence of poor 
job fit and related turnover.
• We continue to hold various roundtable discussions at each facility, with associated
action planning for identified issues.
• Training and development of employees is a key area of focus going forward with an
eye toward creating a more stable, informed and fulfilled workforce.

As a packaged food company that ships millions of pounds of product across
North America, we are keenly aware of our potential impact on the environment from 
energy consumed to packaging used and discarded. We are constantly seeking ways to 
reduce our  environmental footprint.
In 2019, the Company made the decision to move its main distribution center from 
Chicago to a location more centrally located to its operations and, most importantly, 
much closer to its largest manufacturing facility in Emporia, Kansas. By moving our 
distribution center from Chicago to Edgerton, Kansas, we reduced our truck mileage 
by approximately 2.3 million miles annually and thereby materially reduced the 
environmental impact of our trucking operations.
SOME RECYCLING FACTS:
• Over 80%  of our plastic film is recyclable.
• 100%  of our folding cartons are recyclable.
• 100%  of our cardboard is recyclable.
• About 40%  of the cardboard purchased is made from recycled content.
• About 85%  of the packaging we use and sell to our customers and
consumers is recyclable.

RECYCLING CASE STUDY
During 2020, through collaboration between our Operations, Quality 
and Procurement teams and outside vendors, we were able to identify 
material reductions of certain packaging and plastic trays.
PACKAGING REDUCTION OF FILM AND PAPER PACKAGE
We resized packaging and this will decrease the number of pounds 
of non-recyclable packaging by approximately 232,000 lbs, a 7.38%
