{"item1": ">ITEM 1.\nBUSINESS\nOverview\nWe are a water resource management company that owns, operates, and manages water, wastewater, and recycled water utilities in strategically located communities, principally in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona. GWRI seeks to deploy an integrated approach, which the Company refers to as \u201cTotal Water Management\". Total Water Management is a comprehensive approach to water utility management that reduces demand on scarce non-renewable water sources and costly renewable water supplies, in a manner that ensures sustainability and greatly benefits communities both environmentally and economically. This approach employs a series of principles and practices that can be tailored to each community: \n\u2022\nReuse of recycled water, either directly or to non-potable uses, through aquifer recharge, or direct potable reuse;\n\u2022\nRegional planning;\n\u2022\nUse of advanced technology and data;\n\u2022\nEmploying the best subject matter experts and retaining thought and application leaders; \n\u2022\nLeading outreach and educational initiatives to ensure all stakeholders including customers, development partners, regulators, and utility staff are knowledgeable on the principles and practices of our Total Water Management approach; and\n\u2022\nEstablishing partnerships with communities, developers, and industry stakeholders to gain support of our Total Water Management principles and practices.\nWe currently own and operate twenty-five water and wastewater systems in strategically targeted communities in metropolitan Phoenix. We currently serve more than 74,048 people in approximately 27,630 homes within our 376 square miles of certificated service areas, which are serviced by twenty-two wholly-owned regulated operating subsidiaries as of December 31, 2021. Approximately 90.9% of our active service connections are customers of our Global Water - Santa Cruz Water Company, Inc. (\u201cSanta Cruz\u201d) and Global Water - Palo Verde Utilities Company, Inc. (\u201cPalo Verde\u201d) utilities, which are located within a single service area. We have grown significantly since our formation in 2003, with total revenues increasing from $4.9 million in 2004 to $41.9 million in 2021, and total service connections increasing from 8,113 as of December\u00a031, 2004 to 54,182 as of December 31, 2021, with regionally planned areas large enough to serve approximately two million service connections.\nOur Corporate History\nGlobal Water Resources, LLC (\u201cGWR\u201d) was organized in 2003 to acquire, own, and manage a portfolio of water and wastewater utilities in the southwestern region of the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d). Global Water Management, LLC (\u201cGWM\u201d) was formed as an affiliated company to provide business development, management, construction project management, operations, and administrative services to GWR and all of its regulated subsidiaries.\nIn early 2010, the members of GWR made the decision to raise money through the capital markets, and GWR and GWM were reorganized to form Global Water Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation. The members established a new entity, GWR Global Water Resources Corp. (\u201cGWRC\u201d), which was incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) on March\u00a023,\u00a02010 to acquire shares of our common stock and to actively participate in our management, business, and operations through its representation on our board of directors and its shared management. On December\u00a030, 2010, GWRC completed its initial public offering in Canada and its common shares were listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. On June 5, 2013, the Company sold GWM.\nOn May 3, 2016, GWRC merged with and into the Company (the \u201cReorganization Transaction\u201d). At the effective time of the merger, holders of GWRC\u2019s common shares received one share of the Company\u2019s common stock for each outstanding common share of GWRC. As a result of the merger, GWRC ceased to exist as a British Columbia corporation and the Company, governed by the corporate laws of the State of Delaware, was the surviving entity. The Reorganization Transaction was conditional upon the concurrent completion of an initial public offering of shares of common stock of the Company in the U.S. (the \u201cU.S. IPO\u201d), which was completed on May 3, 2016.\nU.S. Water Industry Overview\nU.S. Water Industry Areas of Business\n-5-\nTable of Contents\n \nThe U.S. water industry has two main areas of business:\n\u2022\nUtility Services to Customers\n. This business includes municipal water and wastewater utilities, which are owned and operated by local governments or governmental subdivisions, and investor-owned water\u00a0and wastewater utilities. Investor-owned water and wastewater utilities are generally economically regulated, including with respect to rate regulation, by public utility commissions in the states in which they operate. The utility segment is characterized by high barriers to entry, including high capital spending requirements.\n\u2022\nGeneral Water Products and Services.\n This business includes manufacturing, engineering and consulting companies, and numerous other fee-for-service businesses. The activities of these businesses include the building, financing, and operating of water and wastewater utilities, utility repair services, contract operations, laboratory services, manufacturing and distribution of infrastructure and technology components, and other specialized services. At present, the Company does not perform any unregulated services.\nKey Characteristics of the U.S. Water Industry\nIn the U.S., the water industry is characterized by: \n\u2022\nSignificant Constraints on the Availability of Fresh Water\n. In Arizona, the Arizona Department of Water Resources estimates that annual water usage is 7\u00a0million acre-feet per year. Arizona has the right to use 2.8\u00a0million acre-feet from the Colorado River and approximately half of that can be delivered through the Central Arizona Project, a 336 mile diversion canal from the Colorado River to central Arizona. The Colorado River is presently over-allocated, which means that more surface water right allocations have been\n \nissued than the actual average annual flow, with allocations being determined based on data from a period during which flows were significantly higher than in recent years. The Central Arizona Project is the only means of transporting Colorado River water\n \ninto central Arizona. Approximately 41% of the water used in Arizona comes from groundwater. Water in the western U.S.\n \nis being pumped from groundwater sources faster than it is replenished naturally, a condition known as overdraft. In areas of water scarcity, such as the arid western\n \nU.S., water recycling represents a relatively simple, inexpensive,\n \nand energy-efficient\n \nmeans of augmenting water supply as compared to transporting surface water, groundwater,\n \nor desalinated water from other locations. Approximately 70% of the water provided by municipalities is currently used for non-potable applications where recycled water could potentially be utilized.\n\u2022\nLack of Technology Utilization to Increase Operating Efficiencies and Decrease Operating Costs\n. The U.S. water industry has traditionally not taken advantage of advances in technology available to enhance revenue, increase operating efficiencies, and decrease operating costs (including labor and energy costs). Areas of opportunity include automated meter reading, systems management, and administrative functions, such as customer billing and remittance systems. Key drivers for the lack of investment in technology in water and wastewater utilities have been the historical lack of incentives offered or standards imposed by regulators to achieve efficiencies and lower costs and the ownership of the U.S. water utility sector, which largely consists of small, undercapitalized, municipally-owned utilities that lack the financial and technical resources to pursue technology opportunities.\n\u2022\nHighly Fragmented Ownership\n. The utility segment of the U.S. water industry is highly fragmented, with approximately 50,000 water utilities and approximately 16,000 community wastewater utilities, according to the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection\n \nAgency (\"EPA\")\n. The majority of the approximately 50,000 water utilities are serving a population of 5,000 or less, and 85% of the water utilities serve only 10% of the population.\n\u2022\nLarge Public Sector Ownership\n. Municipally-owned utilities provide water and wastewater services for the vast majority of the U.S. population. For homes connected to a community water system, approximately 80% are provided service by municipally-owned utilities.\n\u2022\nAging Infrastructure in Need of Significant Capital Expenditures\n. Water infrastructure in the U.S. is aging and requires significant investment and stringent focus on cost control to upgrade or replace aging facilities and to provide service to growing populations. Throughout the U.S., utilities are required to make expenditures on the rehabilitation of existing utilities and on the installation of new infrastructure to accommodate growth and make improvements to water quality and wastewater discharges mandated by stricter water quality standards. Water quality standards, first introduced with the Clean Water Act in 1972 and the Safe Drinking Water Act in 1974, are becoming increasingly stringent and numerous. For water, the American Water Works Association estimates investment needs for buried drinking water infrastructure will total more than $1 trillion over the next 25 years. The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates capital investment needs to update and grow the nation\u2019s wastewater systems has now increased to $259 billion per year over a 10-year period according to their recent press release.\u00a0\n-6-\nTable of Contents\n \nPrivate Sector Opportunities\nMunicipal water utilities typically fund their capital expenditure needs through user-based water and wastewater rates, municipal taxes, or the issuance of bonds. However, raising large amounts of funds required for capital investment is often challenging for municipal water utilities, which affects their ability to fund capital spending. Many smaller utilities also do not have the in-house technical and engineering resources to manage significant infrastructure or technology-related investments. In order to meet their capital spending challenges and take advantage of technology-related operating efficiencies, many municipalities are examining a combination of outsourcing and partnerships with the private sector or outright privatizations.\n\u2022\nOutsourcing involves municipally-owned utilities contracting with private sector service providers to provide services, such as meter reading, billing, maintenance, or asset management services.\n\u2022\nPublic-private partnerships among government, operating companies, and private investors include arrangements, such as design, build, and operate contracts; build, own, operate, and transfer contracts; and own, leaseback, and operate contracts.\n\u2022\nPrivatization involves a transfer of responsibility for, and ownership of, the utility from the municipality to private investors.\nWe believe investor-owned utilities that have greater access to capital are generally more capable of making mandated and other necessary infrastructure upgrades to both water and wastewater utilities, addressing increasingly stringent environmental and human health standards, and navigating a wide variety of regulatory processes. In addition, investor-owned utilities that achieve larger scales are able to spread overhead expenses over a larger customer base, thereby reducing the costs to serve each customer. Since many administrative and support activities can be efficiently centralized to gain economies of scale and sharing of best practices, companies that participate in industry consolidation have the potential to improve operating efficiencies, lower costs, and improve service at the same time.\nOur Strategy\nWe are a water resource management company that provides water, wastewater, and recycled water utility services. We believe we are a leader in Total Water Management practices, such as water scarcity management and advanced water recycling applications. Our long-term goal is to become one of the largest investor-owned operators of integrated water and wastewater utilities in areas of the arid western U.S. where water scarcity management is necessary for long-term economic sustainability and growth.\nOur growth strategy involves the elements listed below:\n\u2022\nacquiring or forming utilities in the path of prospective population growth;\n\u2022\nexpanding our service areas geographically and organically growing our customer base within those areas; and\n\u2022\ndeploying our Total Water Management approach into these utilities and service areas.\nWe believe this plan can be executed in our current service areas and in other geographic areas where water scarcity management is necessary to support long-term growth and in which regulatory authorities recognize the need for water conservation through water recycling.\nTotal Water Management is a demand-side-management framework (in that it is a solution intended to drive down demand for water supplies versus develop new water supplies) that alleviates the pressures of water scarcity in communities where growth is reasonably expected to outpace potable water supply. Built on an all-encompassing view of the water cycle, Total Water Management promotes sustainable community development through reduced potable water consumption while monetizing the value of water through each stage of delivery, collection, and reuse.\nOur business model applies Total Water Management in high growth communities. Components of our Total Water Management approach include:\n\u2022\nRegional planning to reduce overall design and implementation costs, leveraging the benefits of replicable designs, gaining the benefits of economies of scale, and enhancing the Company\u2019s position as a primary water and wastewater service provider in the region.\n\u25e6\nFor example, the Company has secured four separate area-wide Clean Water Act Section\u00a0208 Regional Water Quality Management Plans in its major planning areas, covering more than 500 square miles of \n-7-\nTable of Contents\n \nland. To obtain these plans, a provider must develop, amongst other things, a regional wastewater solution, including plans for engineering, infrastructure location and size, and goals for the management of treated reclaimed water, which the Company successfully demonstrated in obtaining its plans.\n\u2022\nStretching a limited resource by maximizing the use of recycled water, using renewable surface water where available and recharging aquifers with any available excess water.\n\u25e6\nFor example, the Company\u2019s water recycling model has been fully implemented in the City of Maricopa. The Company is the water, wastewater, and recycled water provider for the City of Maricopa, which currently has a population of approximately 58,000. A community of this size produces an approximate annual average of 3.2\u00a0million gallons of wastewater per day. Because the Company requires developers to take back and utilize recycled water within their communities and invest in \u201cpurple pipe\u201d recycled water infrastructure during the initial development of subdivisions, the Company is now able to distribute almost all of the 3.2\u00a0million gallons back to the community for beneficial purposes. Approximately 59% of the recycled water goes towards common area non-potable irrigation and for use at a local farm, which allows for the recycled water to naturally recharge into the aquifer. This reduces the total amount of limited ground or surface water that would otherwise be required within the community by over 28%. To date, the Company has reused 9.9 billion gallons of recycled water in the City of Maricopa.\n\u2022\nIntegrating and standardizing water, wastewater, and recycled water infrastructure delivery systems using a separate distribution system of purple pipes to conserve water resources, reduce energy, treatment, and consumable costs (e.g., chemicals, filter media, other general materials, and supplies), provide operational efficiencies, and align the otherwise disparate objectives of water sales and conservation.\n\u25e6\nIn addition to the previous example, which related to the requirements for recycled water usage, the separate distribution system of purple pipes, and water conservation achievements, the Company believes that its model results in additional benefits from an economic perspective due to lower use of power and consumables. For every gallon of recycled water that is directly reused while already on land surface, the need to pump additional scarce groundwater and surface water is eliminated. Such additional groundwater and surface water would otherwise need to be treated and distributed in accordance with the Safe Drinking Water Act, which is costly and requires significant energy.\n\u2022\nGaining market and regulatory acceptance of broad utilization of recycled water through agreements with developers, strategic relationships with governments, academic research, and publication as industry experts, coupled with public education and community outreach campaigns.\n\u25e6\nFor example, the Company has public-private partnerships formally adopted through memorandums of understanding with the City of Maricopa, the City of Casa Grande, and the City of Coolidge. Each memorandum of understanding reflects the Company\u2019s intent to deploy Total Water Management. The Company also has 154 infrastructure coordination and financing agreements with landowners or developer entities that include requirements for usage of recycled water and other attributes that support the Company\u2019s Total Water Management model. As discussed above, the Company\u2019s integrated provider model, which is focused on the maximum use of recycled water, underpins its Clean Water Act Section\u00a0208 Regional Water Quality Management Plans and Designations of Assured Water Supply. In addition, the Company has won numerous awards for education, outreach, and conservation in the water industry. Further, the Company\u2019s experts have published academic papers regarding Total Water Management, as well as provided insight to industry publications.\n\u2022\nIncorporating automated processes, such as supervisory control and data acquisition, automated meter reading, and back-office technologies and \u201cgreen\u201d billing, which reduce operating costs, improve system availability and reliability, and improve customer satisfaction.\n\u25e6\nSupervisory Control and Data Acquisition.\n The Company employs supervisory control and data acquisition in all of its utility systems, which provides continuous monitoring, instantaneous alarming, and historical trending on all key operating assets, including instrumentation and dynamic components (e.g., pumps, motor-controlled valves, treatment systems, etc.). This data is reported back to the appropriate operations personnel through a standard industry software. The benefits of this system include the significantly enhanced ability to: achieve compliance and safety mandates; reduce service outages; troubleshoot systems; provide for remote operations; and allow for proactive maintenance and lower costs related to efficient real-time operations.\n-8-\nTable of Contents\n \n\u25e6\nAutomated Meter Reading. \nThe Company implements automated meter reading with 99% of active customers meters either having automated meter reading or are being upgraded with such functionality in the next 12 months. Currently, all meters in our Maricopa service areas allow for automated meter reading allow for automated meter reading. This technology reads each meter numerous times per day (often hourly) and continuously transmits the meter readings back to a centralized data base through a communications tower and cellular transmission units. The data is then presented to the utility, and is made available to customers, through a simple user interface. Reading meters at this frequency provides many benefits to both the utility and the customer. With this data, utilities can better model demand usage, identify system water loss, identify leaks on the customer side of the meter, monitor for abnormal usage, and present interval, hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly usage back to the customers.\n\u25e6\nBack-Office Technologies and Paperless Billing. \nThe Company employs a series of technologies that allow for the automation of the billing and remittance process. The Company also provides its customers with over seven ways to pay, with the majority of options being integrated with the Company\u2019s back-office technologies. In combination with automated meter reading, this suite of technology has minimized the use of human labor and reduced the potential for human error for the entire billing and remittance process, while providing better customer service.\nWe believe our Total Water Management-based business model provides us with a significant competitive advantage in high growth, water scarce regions. Based on our experience and discussions with developers, we believe developers prefer our approach because it provides a bundled solution to infrastructure provision and improves housing density in areas of scarce water resources. Developers are also focusing on increased consumer and regulatory demands for environmentally friendly or \u201cgreen\u201d housing alternatives. Communities prefer the approach because it provides a partnering platform which promotes economic development, reduces their traditional dependence on bond financing and ensures long term water sustainability.\nOur competitive advantage facilitates the execution of our growth strategy. We believe our proven conservation methods lead to successful permitting for more connections in expanded and new service areas.\nOur Regulated Utilities\nWe own and operate regulated water, wastewater, and recycled water utilities in communities principally located in metropolitan Phoenix. Our utilities are regulated by the ACC, as described further under \u201c\u2014Regulation\u2014Arizona Regulatory Agencies\u201d below. As of December 31, 2021, our utilities collectively had 53,882 active service connections offering predictable rate-regulated cash flows. Revenues from our regulated utilities accounted for approximately 98.3% of total revenues in 2021. Our utilities currently possess the high-level regional permits that allow us to implement our business model; thus, we believe we are well-positioned for organic growth in our current service areas that are generally located in Arizona\u2019s population growth corridors: Maricopa/Casa Grande, West Valley, and Sun Corridor Region.\nA key component of our water utility business is the use of recycled water. Recycled water is highly treated and purified wastewater that is distributed through a separate distribution system of purple pipes for a variety of beneficial, non-potable uses. Recycled water can be delivered for all common area irrigation needs, as well as delivered direct to homes where it can be used for outdoor residential irrigation. Our Total Water Management model, an integrated approach to the use of potable and non-potable water to manage the entire water cycle, both conserves water and maximizes its total economic value. The application of the Total Water Management model has proven to be effective as a means of water scarcity management that promotes sustainable communities and helps achieve greater dwelling unit density in areas where the availability of sustainable water can be a key constraint on development. Our implementation of the Total Water Management philosophy in Arizona has led to the development of relationships with key regulatory bodies.\n-9-\nTable of Contents\n \nA summary description of our utilities at December 31, 2021 is set forth in the following table and described in more detail below:\nUtility\nDate of Acquisition (A) or Formation (F)\nService Provided\nSquare Miles of Service Area (1)(2)\nActive Service Connections (2)\nAverage Monthly Rate Per Service Connection\nMARICOPA / CASA GRANDE REGION\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGlobal Water - Santa Cruz Water Company, Inc.\n2004 (A)\nWater\n81\u00a0\n24,613\u00a0\n$\n56\u00a0\nGlobal Water - Palo Verde Utilities Company, Inc.\n2004 (A)\nWastewater and Recycled Water\n105\u00a0\n24,346\u00a0\n73\u00a0\nGlobal Water - Turner Ranches Irrigation, Inc.\n2018 (A)\nWater\n7\u00a0\n962\u00a0\n70\u00a0\nWEST VALLEY REGION\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGlobal Water - Greater Tonopah Water Company, Inc.\n2006 (A)\nWater\n103\u00a0\n395\u00a0\n93\u00a0\nGlobal Water - Northern Scottsdale Water Company, Inc.\n2006 (A)\nWater\n1\u00a0\n93\u00a0\n221\u00a0\nGlobal Water - Eagletail Water Company, Inc.\n2017 (A)\nWater\n8\u00a0\n71\u00a0\n86\u00a0\nGlobal Water - Balterra Utilities Company, Inc.\n2008 (A)\nWastewater and Recycled Water\n2\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\nGlobal Water - Hassayampa Utilities Company, Inc.\n2005 (F)\nWastewater and Recycled Water\n42\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\nSUN CORRIDOR REGION\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGlobal Water - Picacho Cove Water Company, Inc.\n2006 (F)\nWater\n6\u00a0\n2\u00a0\n826\u00a0\nGlobal Water - Picacho Cove Utilities Company, Inc.\n2006 (F)\nWastewater and Recycled Water\n6\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\nGlobal Water - Red Rock Utilities Company, Inc.\n2018 (A)\nWater, Wastewater and Recycled Water\n11\u00a0\n1,905\u00a0\n70\u00a0\nPIMA COUNTY / TUCSON REGION\nGlobal Water - Francesca Water Company, Inc. \n2020 (A)\nWater\n0.4\u00a0\n124\u00a0\n50\u00a0\nGlobal Water - Mirabell Water Company, Inc. \n2020 (A)\nWater\n0.4\u00a0\n64\u00a0\n65\u00a0\nGlobal Water - Lyn Lee Water Company, Inc.  \n2020 (A)\nWater\n1\u00a0\n39\u00a0\n41\u00a0\nGlobal Water - Tortolita Water Company, Inc.\n2020 (A)\nWater\n0.1\u00a0\n22\u00a0\n64\u00a0\nGlobal Water - Las Quintas Serenas Water Company, Inc.\n0\n2021 (A)\nWater\n2.5\u00a0\n1,246\u00a0\n52\u00a0\nTotal\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n376\n\u00a0\n53,882\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(1) Certified areas may overlap in whole or in part for separate utilities.\n(2) In January 2022 the Company completed the acquisitions of Twin Hawks Utility, Inc. (\"Twin Hawks\"), an operator of a water utility with service area in Pinal county, Arizona and Rincon Water Company, Inc. (\"Rincon\"), an operator of a water utility with service area in Pima County, Arizona. These acquisitions added an aggregate of 91 connections and approximately 9.1 square miles of service area.\nMaricopa/Casa Grande Region\nThe City of Maricopa is located approximately 12 miles south of Phoenix. The relative proximity to a significant urban center, coupled with relatively abundant and inexpensive land, were the key drivers of the real estate boom experienced by this community. In 2005, the City of Maricopa was one of the fastest growing cities in the nation. While growth has slowed nationally since 2007, the City of Maricopa continues to grow, as demonstrated by our addition of 18,342 active service connections (representing approximately 7,330 homes) from December 2009 to December 2021. Development in the area is still considered to be affordable with the median home value being $374,000 compared to $423,000 in the Phoenix Metro area.\nWe operate in this region through Santa Cruz, Palo Verde, and Global Water - Turner Ranches Irrigation, Inc. (\"Turner\").\n-10-\nTable of Contents\n \nWe acquired Santa Cruz and Palo Verde in 2004. Santa Cruz serves 24,613 active service connections as of December 31, 2021 and revenues from Santa Cruz represented approximately 39.5% and 39.6% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Palo Verde serves 24,346 active service connections as of December 31, 2021 and revenues from Palo Verde represented approximately 50.7% and 50.8% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe Santa Cruz and Palo Verde service areas include approximately 186 square miles, which we believe provide further opportunities for growth. Most of the Santa Cruz and Palo Verde infrastructure is less than eighteen years old. Santa Cruz and Palo Verde provide water and wastewater services, respectively, under an innovative public-private partnership memorandum of understanding with the City of Maricopa in Pinal County for approximately 278 square miles of its planning area. We signed a similar memorandum of understanding with the City of Casa Grande to partner in providing water, wastewater, and recycled water services to an approximate 100 square miles of its western region for anticipated growth.\nWe acquired Turner in May 2018. Turner is a non-potable irrigation water utility located in Maricopa County, Arizona, with approximately seven square miles of service area. Turner serves 962 residential irrigation customers as of December 31, 2021.\nRate proceedings were completed in 2010 for both Santa Cruz and Palo Verde. In July 2012, these two utilities filed applications with the ACC for increased rates using 2011 as the test year on which the ACC used to evaluate the utilities\u2019 rates. The rate proceedings were completed in February 2014. On August 28, 2020, Santa Cruz, Palo Verde and Turner each filed a rate case application with the ACC. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Rate Case Activity\u201d, included in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K, for additional information.\nWest Valley Region\nWe operate in this region through Global Water - Greater Tonopah Water Company, Inc. (\u201cGreater Tonopah\u201d), Global Water - Northern Scottsdale Water Company, Inc. (\u201cNorthern Scottsdale\u201d), Global Water - Balterra Utilities Company, Inc. (\u201cBalterra\u201d), Global Water - Hassayampa Utilities Company, Inc. (\u201cHassayampa\u201d), and Global Water - Eagletail Water Company, Inc. (\"Eagletail\"), and formerly through Valencia Water Company, Inc. (\u201cValencia\u201d), Water Utility of Greater Buckeye (\u201cGreater Buckeye\u201d) and Willow Water Valley Co., Inc. (\u201cWillow Valley\u201d).\nWe acquired Greater Tonopah in 2006. Greater Tonopah serves 395 active service connections as of December 31, 2021. Greater Tonopah has a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity (\"CC&N\") for 103 square miles of service area and provides water services to Maricopa County west of the Hassayampa River. The acquisition of Greater Tonopah allowed us to enter into agreements with developers to serve a total of approximately 100,000 home sites plus commercial, schools, parks, and industrial developments at full build-out.\nIn November 2017, the Bill and Melinda Gates Investment Group, through an investment vehicle, acquired 20,000 acres in the Belmont development, located in the West Valley Region. Belmont is a mixed use, master planned community and is included within the service area of Greater Tonopah and Hassayampa. \nWe acquired Northern Scottsdale in 2006. Northern Scottsdale serves 93 active service connections as of December 31, 2021. Northern Scottsdale has a CC&N for one square mile and provides water services to two small subdivisions in Northern Scottsdale.\nWe acquired Balterra in 2006. Balterra is a wastewater utility and has a CC&N for two square miles in an area in western Maricopa County known as Tonopah. Balterra currently has no active service connections; however, its service area lies directly in the expected path of future growth in the far west valley of metropolitan Phoenix, which we believe should provide opportunities for growth once development commences in this area.\nWe formed Hassayampa in 2005. Hassayampa is a wastewater utility and has a CC&N for 42 square miles in an area that is contiguous to Balterra. Hassayampa currently has no active service connections; however, like Balterra, its service area lies directly in the path of future growth in the far west valley of metropolitan Phoenix, which we believe should provide opportunities for growth once development commences in this area.\nIn October 2012, we and our subsidiary, 303 Utilities Company, and the City of Glendale entered into an agreement for future wastewater and recycled water services, advancing our public-private-partnership originally approved by the city council in March 2010. The agreement named 303 Utilities Company as the future wastewater and recycled water provider for a 7,000-acre territory within a portion of Glendale\u2019s western planning area known as the Loop 303 Corridor. The 303 Utilities Company also signed certain wastewater facilities main extension agreements with numerous developers/landowners in the service area to fund the initial design and construction of a wastewater and recycled water utility. In addition, we signed separate offsite water \n-11-\nTable of Contents\n \nmanagement agreements with these same developers/landowners to provide the coordination, permitting, and engineering work for the related water utility service element of the project. In September 2013, we entered into an agreement to sell the Loop 303 Contracts to a third-party. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Corporate Transactions\u2014Sale of Loop 303 Contracts\u201d, included in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K, for additional information.\nWe formerly operated additional utilities in the West Valley Region through Valencia, Greater Buckeye, and Willow Valley. Valencia was consolidated with Greater Buckeye in 2008, and on July 14, 2015, we closed the stipulated condemnation to transfer the operations and assets of Valencia to the City of Buckeye.\u00a0\u00a0See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Corporate Transactions\u2014Stipulated Condemnation of the Operations and Assets of Valencia\u201d, included in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K, for additional information.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn addition, on May 9, 2016, we closed the sale of Willow Valley to EPCOR Water Arizona Inc. (\u201cEPCOR\u201d).\nOn May 15, 2017, we acquired Eagletail via merger. Eagletail serves 71 active connections as of December 31, 2021. Eagletail has a CC&N for eight square miles located west of metropolitan Phoenix.\nRate proceedings were completed in 2010 for Greater Tonopah. Northern Scottsdale completed a rate proceeding in 2008. In July 2012, these five utilities in the West Valley Region filed applications with the ACC for increased rates using 2011 as the test year on which the ACC evaluates the utilities\u2019 rates. The rate proceedings were completed in February 2014. On August 28, 2020, Greater Tonopah, Northern Scottsdale, Balterra, Hassayampa, and Eagletail each filed a rate case application with the ACC. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Rate Case Activity\u201d, included in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K, for additional information.\nSun Corridor Region\nThe Sun Corridor Region is approximately equidistant between Phoenix and Tucson, along the I-10 Corridor.\nWe operate in this region through Global Water-Picacho Cove Water Company, and Global Water-Picacho Cove Utilities Company (collectively, \u201cPicacho Cove\u201d), and Global Water - Red Rock Utilities Company, Inc. (\u201cRed Rock\u201d).\nWe formed Picacho Cove in 2006 to provide water and wastewater services in the City of Eloy and currently have CC&Ns for approximately six congruent square miles. These utilities currently have two active service connections.\nWe acquired Red Rock in October 2018. Red Rock consists of a water and a wastewater utility with service areas in the Pima and Pinal counties of Arizona, with approximately nine square miles of service area. Red Rock serves 963 active water connections and 942 active sewer connections as of December 31, 2021.\nOn August 28, 2020, Picacho Cove and Red Rock each filed a rate case application with the ACC. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Rate Case Activity\u201d, included in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K, for additional information.\nPima County / Tucson Region\nWe operate in this region through Global Water - Mirabell Water Company, Inc. (\u201cMirabell\u201d), Global Water - Francesca Water Company, Inc. (\u201cFrancesca\u201d), Global Water - Tortolita Water Company, Inc. (\u201cTortolita\u201d), Global Water - Lyn Lee Water Company, Inc. (\u201cLyn Lee\u201d), and Global Water - Las Quintas Serenas Water Company, Inc. (\u201cLas Quintas Serenas\u201d).\nWe acquired Mirabell in October 2020. Mirabell serves 64 active water connections as of December 31, 2021. Mirabell has a CC&N for 0.4 square miles located in the southwest area of Tucson, Arizona.\nWe acquired Francesca, Tortolita and Lyn Lee in November 2020. Francesca is located in the southwest area of Tucson, Arizona whereas Tortolita and Lyn Lee are located in Marana, Arizona. As of December 31, 2021, Francesca, Tortolita, and Lyn Lee serve 124, 22, and 39 active water connections, respectively.\nWe acquired Las Quintas Serenas in November 2021. Las Quintas Serenas serves over 1,100 connections with approximately 2.5 square miles of service area located in the northern area of Green Valley, Arizona.\nOperations\n-12-\nTable of Contents\n \nWe treat water to potable standards and also treat, clean, and recycle wastewater for a variety of non-potable uses. A description of these operations follows.\nSources of Water Supply\nOur water supplies are primarily derived from groundwater; however, we currently augment these supplies with recycled water and intend to augment them with surface water and increased use of recycled water in the future.\n\u2022\nPotable Water. Our utilities presently employ groundwater systems for potable water production. Water is brought to the surface from underground aquifers (water levels vary from approximately 60 to 500 feet below land surface depending on the area), disinfected and stored in tanks for distribution to customers. In some instances, individual raw water supplies do not meet the legislative requirements for certain constituents. In those cases, we use well-head, centralized, point-of-use, or blending treatment systems to ensure water quality meets potable standards.\n\u2022\nRecycled Water. Recycled water is created by taking wastewater and applying advanced tertiary treatment (i.e., screening, biological reduction, and filtration and disinfection processes) to create a high quality, non-potable water source. Each step is monitored and controlled in order that the stringent requirements for recycled water are continuously met. Recycled water generated by us meets Arizona\u2019s Aquifer Water Quality Standards before it leaves the treatment facility and is recognized as Class A+, the highest quality of recycled water regulated by the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (\"ADEQ\"). Recycled water can be used for irrigation, facilities cooling, and industrial applications and in a residential setting for toilet flushing and lawn watering.\nSee \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Business and Operational Factors\u2014There is no guaranteed source of water,\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K, for additional information.\nTechnology\nWe use sophisticated technology as a principal means of improving our margins. We focus on technological innovations that allow us to deliver high-quality water and customer service with minimal potential for human error, delays, and inefficiencies. The comprehensive technology platform that we use includes supervisory control and data acquisition, automated meter reading, and geographical information system technologies, which we use to map and monitor our physical assets and water resources on an automated, real-time basis with fewer people than the standard water utility model requires. Our systems allow us to detect and resolve potential problems promptly, accurately, and efficiently before they become more serious, which both improves customer service and optimizes and extends the efficient performance and life of our assets. The comprehensive technology platform that we use includes automated meter reading technology, which allows us to read water meters remotely rather than physically, improves water resources accounting, allows for identification of high water usage and water theft from disconnected meters. We also use automated voice, internet billing, payment processing, and customer service applications that contribute to additional reduced headcount and a reduction in associated personnel costs.\nDecentralized Treatment Facilities\nWe design and build standard, decentralized facilities that are scaled to the service areas they serve in order to achieve optimum efficiency in providing both water and wastewater services. The replication of our standard facility also improves design, construction, and operating efficiency because we are able to employ similar, proven processes and equipment and technologies at each of our facilities. \nAlthough there has not traditionally been a significant economic incentive or other reward for automation and resource efficiency in our industry, we believe our use of automation in lieu of labor, together with our emphasis on streamlined operations and conservation, will position us well for continued profitable growth and allow us to take advantage of future incentives or rewards that may be available to water utilities that are able to successfully enhance the use of renewable resources.\nRegulation\nOur water and wastewater utility operations are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. federal, state, and local regulatory agencies that enforce environmental, health, and safety requirements, which affect all of our regulated subsidiaries. These requirements include the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean Water Act, and the regulations issued under these laws by the EPA. We are also subject to state environmental laws and regulations, such as Arizona\u2019s Aquifer Protection Program and other environmental laws and regulations enforced by the ADEQ, and extensive regulation by the ACC, which regulates public utilities. The ACC also has broad administrative power and authority to set rates and charges, determine service areas and \n-13-\nTable of Contents\n \nconditions of service, and authorize the issuance of securities as well as authority to establish uniform systems of accounts and approve the terms of contracts with both affiliates and customers.\nWe are also subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the storage of hazardous materials, the management and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes, discharges to air and water, the cleanup of contaminated sites, dam safety, fire protection services in the areas we serve, and other matters relating to the protection of the environment, health, and safety.\nWe maintain a comprehensive environmental program which addresses, among other things, responsible business practices and compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including the use and conservation of natural resources. Water samples across our water system are analyzed on a regular basis in material compliance with regulatory requirements. We conducted more than 13,276 water quality tests in 2021 at subcontracted laboratory facilities in addition to providing continuous online instrumentation for monitoring parameters such as turbidity and disinfectant residuals and allowing for adjustments to chemical treatment based on changes in incoming water quality. For 2021, we achieved a compliance rate of 99.96% for meeting state and federal drinking water standards and 99.88% for compliance with wastewater requirements, for an overall compliance rating of 99.9%. Compliance with governmental regulations is of utmost importance to us, and considerable time and resources are spent ensuring compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations.\nIn addition to regulation by governmental entities, our operations may also be affected by civic or consumer advocacy groups. These organizations provide a voice for customers at local and national levels to communicate their service priorities and concerns. Although these organizations may lack regulatory or enforcement authority, they may be influential in achieving service quality and rate improvements for customers.\nSafe Drinking Water Act\nThe federal Safe Drinking Water Act and regulations promulgated thereunder establish minimum national quality standards for drinking water. The EPA has issued rules governing the levels of numerous naturally occurring and man-made chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water and continues to propose new rules. These rules also prescribe testing requirements for detecting contaminants, the treatment systems that may be used for removing contaminants, and other requirements. Federal and state water quality requirements have become increasingly more stringent, including increased water testing requirements, to reflect public health concerns. In Arizona, the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act are incorporated by reference into the Arizona Administrative Code.\nIn order to remove or inactivate microbial organisms, the EPA has promulgated various rules to improve the disinfection and filtration of drinking water and to reduce consumers\u2019 exposure to disinfectants and by-products of the disinfection process.\nContaminants of emerging concern (\"CECs\") are chemicals and other substances that have no regulatory standard, but have been discovered in water or in the environment where they had not previously been detected, or were only present at insignificant levels. We believe CECs may form the basis for additional regulatory initiatives and requirements in the future. We rely on governmental agencies to establish regulatory standards regarding CECs and we meet or exceed these standards, when established. \nAlthough it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements, we do not expect current requirements under the Safe Drinking Water Act to have a material impact on our operations or financial condition, although it is possible new methods of treating drinking water may be required if additional regulations become effective in the future. In addition, capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with environmental mandates traditionally have been recognized by state public utility commissions as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates, although rate recovery may be delayed by \u201cregulatory lag\u201d, that is, the delay between the utility\u2019s test year and the issuance of a rate order approving new rates.\nClean Water Act\nThe federal Clean Water Act regulates discharges of liquid effluents from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities into waters of the U.S., including lakes, rivers, streams and subsurface, or sanitary sewers. In Arizona, with the exception of Clean Water Act Section 208 Regional Water Quality Management Plans, capacity management and operations and maintenance requirements, and source control requirements, wastewater operations are primarily regulated under the Aquifer Protection Permit program and the Arizona Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program (see below).\nThe EPA certifies Clean Water Act Section 208 Regional Water Quality Management Plans and Amendments which govern the location of water reclamation facilities and wastewater treatment plants. The EPA\u2019s 40 C.F.R. Pt. 503 bio-solids requirements \n-14-\nTable of Contents\n \nare reported to the EPA through the ADEQ. While we are not presently regulated to meet source control requirements, we maintain source control through various Codes of Practice that have been accepted by the ACC as enforceable limits on consumer discharges to sanitary sewer systems. We believe we maintain the necessary permits and approvals for the discharges from our water and wastewater facilities.\nArizona Regulatory Agencies\nIn Arizona, the ACC is the regulatory authority with jurisdiction over water and wastewater utilities. The ACC has exclusive authority to approve rates, mandate accounting treatments, authorize long-term financing programs, evaluate significant capital expenditures and plant additions, examine and regulate transactions between a regulated subsidiary and its affiliated entities, and approve or disapprove reorganizations, mergers, and acquisitions prior to their completion. Additionally, the ACC has statutory authority to oversee service quality and consumer complaints, and approve or disapprove expansion of service areas. The ACC is comprised of five elected members, each serving a four year term. Companies that wish to provide water or wastewater service apply for a CC&N, which, if granted, allows them to serve customers within a geographic area specified by a legal description of the property. In considering an application for a CC&N, the ACC will determine if the applicant is fit and proper to provide service within a specified area, whether the applicant has sufficient technical, managerial, and financial capabilities to provide the service, and if that service is necessary and in the public interest. Once a CC&N is granted, the utility falls under the ACC\u2019s jurisdiction and must abide by the rules and laws under which a public service corporation operates. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Rate Case Activity,\u201d included in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K, for additional information regarding rate case activity involving the ACC.\nArizona water and wastewater utilities must also comply with state environmental regulation regarding drinking water and wastewater, including environmental regulations set by Councils of Government (such as the Central Arizona Governments and the Maricopa Association of Governments), the ADEQ, and the Arizona Department of Water Resources. The Central Arizona Governments is the designated management authority for Section 208 of the Clean Water Act for Pinal and Gila Counties and administers the requirements of the Regional Water Quality Management Plans and Amendments at the local level. The Maricopa Association of Governments is the designated management authority for Section 208 of the Clean Water Act for Maricopa County and administers the requirements of the Regional Water Quality Management Plans and Amendments at the local level. The Maricopa County Environmental Services Department has delegated authority for overseeing ADEQ requirements in Maricopa County. The Pima County Department of Environmental Quality has delegated authority for overseeing ADEQ requirements in Pima County.\n \nThe ADEQ regulates water quality and permits water reclamation facilities, discharges of recycled water, re-use of recycled water, and recharge of recycled water. The ADEQ also regulates the clean closure requirements of facilities. In Arizona, the ADEQ has received delegated authority from the EPA for the administration of the Clean Water Act\u2019s National Pollution Discharge Elimination System program. Permits issued by the ADEQ for discharges to waters of the U.S. in Arizona are termed \u201cArizona Pollutant Discharge Elimination System,\u201d or \u201cAZPDES,\u201d permits. The ADEQ also administers the drinking water quality requirements set by the federal Safe Drinking Water Act within Arizona. Finally, the Arizona Department of Water Resources regulates surface water extraction, groundwater withdrawal, designations and certificates of assured water supply, extinguishment of irrigation grandfathered water rights, groundwater savings facilities, recharge facilities, recharge permits, recovery well permits, storage accounts, and well construction, abandonment, or replacement. We must file periodic reports with the ACC, ADEQ, and Arizona Department of Water Resources.\nWithin each regulatory organization, we have invested in developing cooperative relationships at all levels, from staff to executives to elected and appointed officials, and have adopted a proactive attitude toward regulatory compliance.\nAssured and Adequate Water Supply Regulations\nWe intend to seek access to renewable water supplies as we grow our water resource portfolio. However, we currently rely almost exclusively (and are likely to continue to rely) on the pumping of groundwater and the generation and delivery of recycled water for non-potable uses to meet future demands in our service areas. Aside from some rights to water through the Central Arizona Project, groundwater (and recycled water derived from groundwater) is the only water supply available to us.\nAlthough we intend to rely on recycled water to help meet water demands in areas, the infrastructure, permits, and customer base necessary to generate and deliver recycled water are not necessarily in place in most of our service areas. In addition, although recycling can extend a limited supply, it does not actually generate a new supply of water. As such, although our proposed generation and delivery of recycled water is likely to help reduce the amount of groundwater that will be required to serve future customers, our ability to serve new customers will remain dependent on our ability to access groundwater. Groundwater is a limited resource in Arizona, and access to new uses of groundwater is closely regulated in the areas served by us. See \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Business and Operational Factors\u2014Inadequate water and wastewater supplies could have a material adverse effect upon our ability to achieve the customer growth necessary to increase our revenues,\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K, for additional information.\n-15-\nTable of Contents\n \nNearly all of our service areas are located in \u201cActive Management Areas,\u201d areas within which the use of groundwater is regulated by the Arizona Department of Water Resources in order to manage ongoing problems with groundwater overdraft. The Phoenix, Prescott, and Tucson Active Management Areas are legally mandated to achieve \u201csafe yield\u201d by 2025 or sooner. However, we do not expect any of these Active Management Areas to achieve their safe yield goals. Safe yield requires groundwater pumping to not draw down the groundwater aquifers, or \u201cover-draft,\u201d as all pumping is offset or replaced within the Active Management Area from a renewable supply. The Pinal Active Management Area, which encompasses our major service areas near Maricopa, is managed to allow development of non-irrigation uses and to preserve existing agricultural economies in the Active Management Area for as long as feasible, consistent with the necessity to preserve future water supplies for non-irrigation uses.\nUnder Arizona\u2019s assured water supply laws and regulations, a new subdivision inside an Active Management Area must demonstrate that it has an \u201cassured water supply\u201d to the satisfaction of the Arizona Department of Water Resources before the developer is permitted to sell lots. Demonstration of an assured water supply requires, among other things, that an applicant demonstrate that water supplies will be physically, continuously, and legally available to satisfy the water needs of the proposed use for at least 100 years. A developer may make an independent showing of an assured water supply (resulting in a Certificate of Assured Water Supply for a subdivision) or may obtain a written commitment for service from a designated water provider, such as a privately owned water company or a municipal water supplier. Under the latter approach, the water provider must demonstrate satisfaction of assured water supply requirements for the developments within its service areas (resulting in a Designation of Assured Water Supply for the provider). At present, we have obtained a Designation of Assured Water Supply in the Maricopa/Casa Grande service territory (Santa Cruz) for approximately 22,900 acre-feet of water use. A Designation of Assured Water Supply is subject to periodic review and renewal by the Arizona Department of Water Resources and can be increased as demand grows within the service territory, subject to the physical availability of existing water supplies and any additional supplies acquired for use within the Designation of Assured Water Supply. Over time, we anticipate Santa Cruz will apply to increase the Designation of Assured Water Supply as sufficient increased demand is established in the area. Under our highly efficient Total Water Management model, which is intended to achieve much lower per-unit potable water use rates than would be expected for average developments, 22,900 acre-feet could be sufficient water supply for approximately 91,600 homes per year.\nIn our West Valley service territory (Greater Tonopah), we are seeking a Designation of Assured Water Supply in the future. Assuming implementation of our high-efficiency Total Water Management model throughout the service area, we believe this could be a sufficient water supply for tens of thousands of homes. There is no assurance that the Arizona Department of Water Resources would provide a new Designation of Assured Water Supply or add any additional acre-feet to our Designations of Assured Water Supply in the future.\nIn our other service areas, we rely upon a Certificate of Assured Water Supply obtained by developers to demonstrate an assured water supply, or will apply for a Designation of Assured Water Supply in the future when required.\nOutside of Arizona\u2019s Active Management Areas, the \u201cadequate water supply\u201d program requires a determination of whether there is an adequate water supply\u2014similar to an assured water supply\u2014but it does not necessarily foreclose development when the showing cannot be made. Unless the county government has voted to make the requirement mandatory, a development (outside of Active Management Areas) that cannot demonstrate access to an adequate water supply is generally required only to disclose this fact, although as a practical matter few developments have proceeded on this basis. In addition, whether a water provider to such a development has access to an adequate water supply is nevertheless relevant to its business.\nOther Environmental, Health, and Safety (including Water Quality) Matters\nOur operations also involve the use, storage, and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. For example, our water and wastewater treatment facilities store and use chlorine and other chemicals and generate wastes that require proper handling and disposal under applicable environmental regulations. We could also incur remedial costs in connection with any environmental contamination relating to our operations or facilities, releases or our off-site disposal of wastes. Although we are not aware of any material cleanup or decontamination obligations, the discovery of contamination or the imposition of such obligations arising under relevant federal, state, and local laws and regulations in the future could result in additional costs. Our facilities and operations also are subject to requirements under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act and similar laws in Arizona.\nOur compliance with all of the environmental, health, and safety (including water quality) requirements described above may be subject to inspections and enforcement measures by federal, state, and local agencies.\nSecurity\nDue to security, vandalism, terrorism, and other risks, we take precautions to protect our employees and the water delivered to our customers. In 2002, federal legislation was enacted that resulted in new regulations concerning security of water facilities, including submitting vulnerability assessment studies to the federal government. We have complied with EPA regulations \n-16-\nTable of Contents\n \nconcerning vulnerability assessments and have made filings to the EPA as required. Vulnerability assessments are conducted regularly to evaluate the effectiveness of existing security controls and serve as the basis for further capital investment in security for the facility. Information security controls are deployed or integrated to prevent unauthorized access to company information systems, assure the continuity of business processes dependent upon automation, ensure the integrity of our data and support regulatory and legislative compliance requirements. In addition, communication plans have been developed as a component of our procedures. While we do not make public comments on the details of our security programs, we have been in contact with federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to coordinate and improve the security of our water delivery systems and to safeguard our water supply.\nCompetition\nAs an owner and operator of regulated utilities, we do not face competition within our existing service areas because Arizona law provides the holder of a CC&N for water and wastewater service with an exclusive right to provide that service within the certificated area, as against other public service corporations. In addition, the high cost of constructing water and wastewater systems in an existing market creates a barrier to entry. We do, however, face competition from other water and wastewater utilities for new service areas and with respect to the acquisition of smaller utilities. We believe our principal competitors for new service areas and acquisitions in Arizona are EPCOR Water Arizona Inc., Arizona Water Company, Central States Water Resources, Northwest Natural Water Company, LLC, Ullico Inc. and Liberty Utilities. We believe competition for new service areas and acquisitions is based on relationships with municipalities and developers, experience in making acquisitions, the ability to finance and obtain regulatory approval, quality and breadth of products and services, the ability to integrate both water and wastewater services, and implement conservation practices throughout the service areas, price, speed, and ease of implementation.\nIf we seek to extend our services outside Arizona, we will face competition from other regional or national water utilities for these opportunities.\nAlthough we believe we compete effectively in our regulated businesses, our competitors may have more resources and experience than we have and may therefore have a competitive advantage.\nSegment Reporting\nWe currently operate in one geographic region within the State of Arizona, wherein each operating utility operates within the same regulatory environment, and is operated as one reportable segment. We do not have any customers that contribute more than 10% to our revenues or revenue streams. For additional information, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Segment Reporting\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nSeasonality\n\u00a0\nCustomer demand for our water during the warmer months is generally greater than other times of the year due primarily to additional consumption of water in connection with irrigation systems, swimming pools, cooling systems, and other outside water use. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months, demand may vary with temperature, as well as the timing and overall levels of rainfall. In the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the customer demand for our water may decrease and therefore, adversely affect our revenues. \nSee \u201cManagement\u2019s\n \nDiscussion\n \nand Analysis\n \nof Financial\n \nCondition\n \nand Results\n \nof Operations\u2014Factors Affecting our Results of Operations\u2014Weather and Seasonality,\u201d\n \nincluded in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K,\n \nfor\n \nadditional\n \ninformation\n.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2021, we employed 86 full-time individuals and 2 part-time employees. This represents an increase of seven employees, or 8.6% from December 31, 2020 due primarily to the hiring of additional employees throughout the organization as the company continues to grow. Currently, none of our employees participate in collective bargaining agreements, and we consider our employee relations to be good.\nWe offer comprehensive compensation and benefits package to attract and retain top talent. In addition to competitive base wages, additional benefits include annual bonus opportunities, employee stock options, Company matched 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, flexible spending accounts and paid time off.\n-17-\nTable of Contents\n \nAvailable Information\nWe maintain an Internet website at \nwww.gwresources.com\n.

The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations in future periods.\nLegal, Regulatory, and Legislative Factors\nWe are subject to regulation by the Arizona Corporation Commission and our financial condition depends upon our ability to recover costs in a timely manner from customers through regulated rates.\nWe are subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal, state and local regulatory agencies that significantly influence our business, liquidity, and results of operations and our ability to fully recover costs from utility customers in a timely manner. The Arizona Corporation Commission (\u201cACC\u201d) is the regulatory authority with jurisdiction over water and wastewater utilities. The ACC has exclusive authority to approve rates, mandate accounting treatments, authorize long-term financing programs, evaluate significant capital expenditures and plant additions, examine and regulate transactions between a regulated subsidiary and its affiliated entities, and approve or disapprove reorganizations, mergers, and acquisitions prior to their completion. Additionally, the ACC has statutory authority to oversee service quality and consumer complaints, and approve or disapprove expansion of service areas. The ACC is comprised of five elected members, each serving four year terms.\u00a0Our profitability is affected by the rates we may charge and the timeliness of recovering costs incurred through our rates.\u00a0Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the satisfactory resolution of any rate proceedings and ancillary matters which may come before the ACC.\u00a0In addition, the ACC may reopen prior decisions and modify otherwise final orders under certain circumstances.\u00a0Decisions made by the ACC could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOn August 28, 2020, 12 of our 18 regulated utilities each filed a rate case application with the ACC for water, wastewater, and recycled water rates, as well as the consolidation of water and/or wastewater rates for certain of the utilities. There can be no assurance, however, that the ACC will approve the requested rate increase or any increase or the consolidation of water and wastewater rates described above, and the ACC could take other actions as a result of the rate case. Further, it is possible that the ACC may determine to decrease future rates. There can also be no assurance as to the timing of when an approved rate increase (if any) would go into effect.\nSee \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Rate Case Activity\u201d, included in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K, for additional information regarding matters relating to the ACC.\nNew or stricter regulatory standards or other governmental actions could increase our regulatory compliance and operating costs, which could cause our profitability to suffer, particularly if we are unable to increase our rates to offset such costs.\n \nIn Arizona, water and wastewater utilities are subject to regulation by water, environmental, public utility, and health and safety regulators, and we are required to obtain environmental permits from governmental agencies in order to operate our facilities. Regulations relate to, among other things, standards and criteria for drinking water quality and for wastewater discharges, customer service and service delivery standards, waste disposal and raw groundwater abstraction limits, and rates and charges for our regulated services. There may be instances in the future when we are not in or cannot achieve compliance with new and evolving laws, regulations, and permits without incurring additional operating costs. For example, in 2006, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") implemented a new arsenic maximum contaminant level, which effectively required the installation and operation of costly arsenic treatment systems at many of our water production facilities.  \nOur costs of complying with current and future governmental laws and regulations could adversely affect our business or results of operations. If we fail to comply with these laws, regulations, or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators and our operations could be curtailed or shut down. We may also be exposed to product liability or breach of contract claims by third parties resulting from our noncompliance. These laws and regulations are complex and change frequently, and these changes may cause us to incur costs in connection with the remediation of actions that were lawful when they were taken. Failure by us to observe the conditions and comply with the requirements of permits and other applicable laws and regulations could result in delays, additional costs, fines, and other adverse consequences, including the inability to proceed with development in our service areas.\n-19-\nTable of Contents\n \nWe may incur higher compliance or remediation costs than expected in any particular period and may not be able to pass those increased costs along to our customers immediately through rate increases, or at all. This is because we must obtain regulatory approval to increase our rates, which can be time-consuming and costly and our requests for increases may not be approved in part or in full.\nWe are required to test our water quality for certain parameters and potential contaminants on a regular basis. If the test results indicate that parameters or contaminants exceed allowable limits, we may be required either to commence treatment to remedy the water quality or to develop an alternate water source. Either of these outcomes may be costly, and there can be no assurance that the regulatory authorities would approve rate increases to recover these additional compliance costs. In addition, by the time that test results are available, contaminated water may have been provided to customers, which may result in liability for us and damage our reputation.\nIn addition, governments or government agencies that regulate our operations may enact legislation or adopt new requirements that could have an adverse effect on our business, including:\n\u2022\nrestricting ownership or investment;\n\u2022\nproviding for the expropriation of our assets by the government through condemnation or similar proceedings;\n\u2022\nproviding for changes to water and wastewater quality standards;\n\u2022\nrequiring\n \ncancellation or renegotiation of, or unilateral changes to, agreements relating to our provision of water and wastewater services;\n\u2022\nchanging regulatory or legislative emphasis on water conservation in comparison to other goals and initiatives;\n\u2022\npromoting an increase of competition among water companies within our designated service areas;\n\u2022\nrequiring the provision of water or wastewater services at no charge or at reduced prices;\n\u2022\nrestricting the ability to terminate services to customers whose accounts are in arrears;\n\u2022\nrestricting the ability to sell assets or issue securities;\n\u2022\nadversely changing tax, legal, or regulatory requirements, including employment, property ownership, or general business regulations; changing environmental requirements and the imposition of additional requirements and costs on our operations; and including but not limited to changes adopted in response to regulatory measures to address the COVID-19 pandemic or global climate change;\n\u2022\nchanges in the charges applied to raw water abstraction;\n\u2022\nchanges in rate making policies; or\n\u2022\nrestrictions relating to water use and supply, including restrictions on use, increased offsetting groundwater replenishment obligations, changes to the character of groundwater rights, and settlement of Native American claims.\nWe have significant obligations under Infrastructure Coordination and Financing Agreements (\u201cICFAs\u201d), yet funds from our ICFAs are dependent on development activities by developers which we do not control and are also subject to certain regulatory requirements.\nPrior to 2014, we extended water and wastewater infrastructure financing to developers and builders through ICFAs. These agreements are contracts with developers or builders in which we coordinate and fund the construction of water, wastewater, and recycled water facilities that will be owned and operated by our regulated subsidiaries in advance of completion of developments in the area. Our investment can be considerable, as we phase-in the construction of facilities in accordance with a regional master plan, as opposed to a single development. Developers and builders pay us agreed-upon fees upon the occurrence of specified development events for their development projects. The ACC requires us to record a portion of the funds we receive under ICFAs as contributions in aid of construction (\u201cCIAC\u201d), which are funds or property provided to a utility under the terms of a collection main extension agreement and/or service connection tariff, the value of which are not refundable. Amounts received as CIAC reduce our rate base once expended on utility plants.\nThe developer is not required to pay the bulk of the agreed-upon fees until a development receives platting approval. Accordingly, we cannot always accurately predict or control the timing of the collection of our fees. If a developer encounters difficulties, such as during a real estate market downturn, that result in a complete or partial abandonment of the development or a significant delay in its completion, we will have planned, built, and invested in infrastructure that will not be supported by \n-20-\nTable of Contents\n \ndevelopment and will not generate either payments under the applicable ICFA or cash flows from providing services. As a result, our return on our investment and cash flow stream could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to expand into new service areas and to expand current water and wastewater service depends on approval from regulatory agencies. Failure to obtain required regulatory approvals will adversely affect future growth.\nIn Arizona, the ACC is the regulatory authority that oversees the formation, expansion, and ongoing operations of water and wastewater utilities. The ACC has authority, among other things, to determine service areas for utility providers. In order for our owned utilities to provide water or wastewater service, they must obtain a CC&N for a service area before they can service that area. In addition, our owned utilities and/or the developments that we serve must demonstrate to the Arizona Department of Water Resources that there exists a 100-year water supply and obtain either a \u201cCertificate of Assured Water Supply,\u201d which is a certificate issued by the Arizona Department of Water Resources evidencing sufficient groundwater, surface water, or effluent of adequate quality will be continuously available to satisfy the water needs of the proposed use for at least one hundred years and which applies to a specific subdivision, or a Designation of Assured Water Supply, which applies to the utility\u2019s entire service area. The designation area is generally coterminous with the CC&N and can grow into adjacent areas as needed. Further, our wastewater facilities require ADEQ and/or EPA permits that regulate, among other things, the level of discharges from our facilities, the size of our facilities, and the location of our facilities. Any inability to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals, assured water supplies, or environmental permits would limit our ability to expand our water or wastewater service areas.\nIf we chose to expand to states other than Arizona, we may have difficulty acquiring the necessary approvals and permits or complying with environmental, health and safety, or quality standards of such states. See \u201c\u2014Market and Financial Factors\u2014 Doing business in jurisdictions other than Arizona may present unforeseen regulatory, legal, and operational challenges that could impede or delay our operations or adversely affect our profitability.\u201d\nChanges to environmental and other regulation may require us to alter our existing treatment facilities or build additional facilities.\nTo comply with federal, state, and local environmental laws, our existing facilities may need to be altered or replaced, which may cause us to incur significant additional costs. Altered and new facilities and other capital improvements must be constructed and operated in accordance with multiple requirements, including, in certain cases, an Aquifer Protection Permit issued by the ADEQ, Arizona Pollution Discharge Elimination System permits from the ADEQ, and an air quality permit from Maricopa or Pinal Counties. The provision of potable water is subject to, among others, the requirements of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, and effluent from wastewater treatment facilities must comply with other requirements. Regulated contaminants and associated maximum contaminant levels may change over time, requiring us to alter or build additional treatment facilities. \nChanges in, interpretations of, or enforcement trends related to tax rules and regulations may adversely affect our effective income tax rates or operating margins and we may be required to pay additional tax assessments. \nOur effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by various factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws, regulations, and/or interpretations of such tax laws in multiple jurisdictions, including but not limited to U.S. federal and state regulations or interpretations resulting from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"TCJA\");\n\u2022\nincreases in corporate tax rates and the availability of deductions or credits;\n\u2022\ntax effects related to purchase accounting for acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nresolutions of issues arising from tax examinations and any related interest or penalties.\nOur determination of tax liabilities is always subject to review or examination by applicable tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of such review or examination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n-21-\nTable of Contents\n \nSignificant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. Our calculation of the provision for income taxes is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file. In addition, our income tax returns are subject to periodic examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities.\nSee \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition \u2014Corporate Transactions \u2014ACC Tax Docket\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for more information on the ACC docket that addresses the utility ratemaking implications of the TCJA.\nWe are exposed to various risks relating to legal proceedings or claims that could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business. Litigation in general can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. Responding to lawsuits brought against us, or legal actions that we may initiate, can often be expensive and time-consuming. Unfavorable outcomes from these claims and/or lawsuits could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition, and we could incur substantial monetary liability and/or be required to change our business practices.\nOur water and wastewater systems are subject to condemnation by governmental authorities, which may result in the receipt of less than the fair market value of our assets and a loss of revenue from our operations\n.\nMunicipalities and other governmental subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water and wastewater services, and efforts may arise from time to time to convert some or all of our assets to public ownership and operation. Arizona law provides for the acquisition of public utility property by governmental agencies through their power of eminent domain, also known as condemnation.\u00a0For example, the assets of our former utility subsidiaries, Cave Creek Water Co. and Valencia, were acquired from us by municipalities pursuant to condemnation proceedings, and our other utility subsidiaries could be subjects of such proceedings in the future.  Should a municipality or other governmental subdivision seek to acquire some or all of our assets through eminent domain, we would likely resist the acquisition.\nContesting an exercise of condemnation through eminent domain may result in costly legal proceedings and may divert the attention of our management from the operation of our business. Moreover, our efforts to resist any such condemnation may not be successful.\nIf a municipality or other governmental subdivision succeeds in acquiring some or all of our assets through eminent domain, there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for such assets and that we will incur significant one-time charges. Condemnation also results in a loss of revenue from the operations of the affected utility.\nProposals to change policy in Arizona made through ballot initiatives may impact our growth, business plans and financial condition.\nIn Arizona, a person or organization may file a ballot initiative with the Arizona Secretary of State and, if a sufficient number of verifiable signatures are submitted, the initiative may be placed on the ballot for the public to vote on the matter. Ballot initiatives may relate to any matter, including taxes and policy and regulation related to our industry, and may change statutes or the state constitution in ways that could impact our customers, the Arizona economy, and the Company. The passage of this or other  initiatives could depress expected population growth, impact our business or growth plans, and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are subject to environmental risks that may subject us to clean-up costs or litigation that could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and prospects.\nUnder various federal and state environmental laws, regulations, ordinances, and other requirements, a current or previous owner or operator of real property or a facility may be liable for the costs of removal, remediation, or containment of hazardous or toxic substances on, under, in, or released from such property. These liabilities are not limited to a potential effect on our water supply and include, but are not limited to, liabilities associated with air, soil, or groundwater contamination at any real estate or facilities we own or operate, including liabilities assumed in an acquisition of another utility. Environmental laws often impose liability regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. Although we currently conduct environmental screening assessments on new properties that we propose to acquire or use to identify significant sources of contaminants on surrounding properties, these assessments are not comprehensive, nor have they been conducted for all of the property owned or used by us. As a result, hazardous or toxic \n-22-\nTable of Contents\n \nsubstances may exist at properties owned or used by us. If hazardous or toxic substances are discovered at real property or facilities owned or used by us (including a landfill owned by another party that is used by us for disposal of hazardous substances), we could incur significant remediation costs, liability exposure, or litigation expenses that could adversely affect our profitability, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nBusiness and Operational Factors\nInadequate water and wastewater supplies could have a material adverse effect upon our ability to achieve the customer growth necessary to increase our revenues.\nIn many areas of Arizona (including certain areas that we service), water supplies are limited and, in some cases, current usage rates exceed sustainable levels for certain water resources. As discussed above, we currently rely predominantly (and are likely to continue to rely) on the pumping of groundwater and the generation and delivery of recycled water for non-potable uses to meet future demands in our service areas. At present, groundwater (and recycled water derived from groundwater) is the primary water supply available to us.\nWe do not currently anticipate any short-term concerns with physical, legal, or continuous availability issues in our service areas. Regardless, the supply of groundwater in Central Arizona, while considerable, is also ultimately finite, closely regulated, and geographically limited. In areas where we have not applied for a \u201cDesignation of Assured Water Supply\u201d, we have not performed hydrological studies or modeling to evaluate the amount of groundwater likely to be available to meet present and expected future demands. Insofar as we intend to rely on the pumping of groundwater and the generation and delivery of recycled water to meet future demands in our current service areas, our ability and/or the ability of developers inside of our service areas to meet regulatory requirements and to demonstrate assured and adequate water supplies is essential to the continued growth of our service connections and our capacity to supply water to our customers.\nInsufficient availability of water or wastewater treatment capacity could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide for expected customer growth necessary to increase revenues. We continuously look for new sources of water to augment our reserves in our service areas, but have not yet obtained surface water rights. Our ability to obtain such rights may depend on factors beyond our control, such as the future availability of Colorado River water supplies. We also plan to construct facilities and obtain the necessary permits to recharge recycled water to stretch and augment our existing and planned future water supplies, but do not yet have this capability in all of our service areas. As a result, it is possible that, in the future, we will not be able to obtain sufficient water or water supplies to increase customer growth necessary to increase or even maintain our revenues.\nWe do not control when and where a developer may request service within our service areas, and if this occurs outside the location and capacity of existing infrastructure, it may require significantly more capital expenditures than currently anticipated.\nIf a developer has an ICFA, and/or once a developer has entered into a service agreement with our utility subsidiary and the property being developed has been included within a service area, we have the obligation to serve under the terms of those agreements and existing regulations. Although we have built substantial modern infrastructure within these utilities in areas where development is currently occurring, there is the potential that a developer may request service in another location within the service area. Extending/expanding the existing infrastructure to provide service may result in the need to make additional, currently unplanned, capital improvements and there is no guarantee that we may recover our costs timely. As a result, our return on our investment and cash flow stream could be adversely affected.\nOur utilities business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and other weather-related conditions, such as droughts, which could adversely affect the supply of and demand for our services and our results of operations.\nWe depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future needs of our customers. Whether we have an adequate water supply depends upon a variety of factors, including underground water supply from which groundwater is pumped, the rate at which it is recharged by rainfall and snowpack, and changes in the amount of water used by our customers. In particular, the arid western U.S. region, which includes our present and potential service areas, has been required to deal with general conditions of water scarcity exacerbated by extended periods of drought.\nDrought conditions could interfere with our sources of water supply and could adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our existing and future customers. Any future interruption to our water supply or restrictions on water usage during drought conditions or other legal limitations on water use could result in decreased customer billing and lower \n-23-\nTable of Contents\n \nrevenues or higher expenses that we would not be able to recoup without prior regulatory approval for a rate increase, which may not be granted. These conditions could also lead to increases in capital expenditures needed to build infrastructure to secure alternative water sources. Furthermore, customers may use less water even after a drought has ended because of conservation patterns developed during the drought. Population growth could also decline under drought conditions as individuals and businesses move out of the area or elect not to relocate there. Lower water use for any reason could lead to lower revenue.\nDemand for water is seasonal and varies with temperature and rainfall levels. If temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the demand for our water may decrease, which would adversely affect our profitability, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Consequently, the results of operations for one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for future quarters or the full year.\nThere is no guaranteed source of water.\nOur ability to meet the existing and future water demands of our customers depends on an adequate supply of water. Regulatory restrictions on the use of groundwater and the development of groundwater wells, lack of available water rights, drought, overuse of local or regional sources of water, protection of threatened species or habitats, or other factors, including climate change, may limit the availability of ground or surface water.\nAs stated above, our primary source of water is pumping of groundwater from aquifers within service areas. In the event that our wells cannot meet customer demand, we may, under certain circumstances, purchase water from surrounding municipalities, agencies, and other utilities. However, the cost of purchasing water is typically more expensive than producing it. Furthermore, these alternative sources may not always have an adequate supply to sell to us.\nTo date, we have been able to produce enough water to meet current customer requirements. However, no assurance can be given that we will be able to produce or purchase enough water to fully satisfy future customer demand. We can make no guarantee that we will always have access to an adequate supply of water that will meet all quality standards, or that the cost of water will not adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we are unable to access adequate water supplies, we may be unable to satisfy all customer demand, which could result in rationing. Rationing may have an adverse effect on cash flow from operations.\nWater shortages may affect us in a variety of ways. For example, water shortages could:\n\u2022\nadversely affect water supply mix by causing us to rely on more expensive purchased water;\n\u2022\nadversely affect operating costs;\n\u2022\nincrease the risk of contamination to water systems due to the inability to maintain sufficient pressure;\n\u2022\nincrease capital expenditures for building pipelines to connect to alternative sources of supply, new wells to replace those that are no longer in service or are otherwise inadequate to meet the needs of customers, and reservoirs and other facilities to conserve or reclaim water; and\n\u2022\nresult in regulatory authorities refusing to approve new service areas if an adequate water supply cannot be demonstrated and restrictions on new customer connections may be imposed in existing service areas if there is not sufficient water.\nWe may or may not be able to recover increased operating and construction costs as a result of water shortages on a timely basis, or at all, for our regulated utilities through the rate setting process.\nWe face risks associated with the design, construction, and operation of our systems that may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe are responsible for the design, construction, installation, and maintenance of our water treatment, reclamation, and distribution systems. We could be adversely affected by a failure to complete our construction projects on time or on budget, and a substantial delay in the progress of construction due to adverse weather, work stoppages, shortages of materials, non-issuances of permits, nonperformance of suppliers or contractors, or other factors could result in a material increase in the overall cost of such projects.\n-24-\nTable of Contents\n \nWe cannot guarantee that our systems will operate as designed or be free from defects. The failure of our systems to operate properly could cause significant public harm. Any defects in our systems or significant reliability, quality, or performance problems with respect to our systems or services could have a number of negative effects on our profitability, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows, including:\n\u2022\nloss of revenues;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management and development resources and the attention of engineering personnel;\n\u2022\nsignificant customer relations problems;\n\u2022\nincreased repair, support, and insurance expenses;\n\u2022\nadverse regulatory actions; and\n\u2022\nlegal actions for damages by our customers, including but not limited to damages based on commercial losses and effects on human health.\nWe may have difficulty recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, and due to the technical and specialized nature of our business, our profitability may suffer if we do not have the necessary workforce.\nOur operating utilities require some of our employees to be certified operators of record, a designation requiring specialized training and certification in water and wastewater systems. As workers with these qualifications retire in the industry, we may be unable to replace them readily in view of the relatively low number of younger workers that we believe are entering the workforce to pursue this line of work. Our operations require a variety of other technical skills and specialties in the areas of engineering, systems analysis, laboratory work, and equipment repair, and we may have difficulty recruiting and retaining personnel with these skills. If we cannot maintain an employee base with the skills necessary to conduct our operations, our efficiency, margins, and ability to expand our business could be adversely affected.\nWe face competition for new service areas and acquisition targets.\nWe face competition from other water and wastewater utilities for new service areas and with respect to acquisitions of smaller utilities. These competitors consist primarily of municipalities and investor-owned utilities seeking expansion opportunities. Some of our competitors are larger than we are and have more resources and access to capital than we do. If we are unable to compete effectively for new service areas and acquisitions of existing utilities, our ability to increase our rate base and revenue could be adversely affected.\nIf future acquisitions do not achieve sufficient profitability relative to expenses and investment, our business and ability to finance our operations could be materially adversely affected.\nA typical element of a utility growth strategy is the acquisition or development of other water and wastewater utilities. The potential negotiation of future acquisitions and development of new projects could require us to incur significant costs and expose us to significant risks, including:\n\u2022\nrisks relating to the condition of assets acquired and exposure to residual liabilities of prior businesses;\n\u2022\noperating risks, including equipment, technology and supply problems, failure to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies, regulatory requirements, and approvals necessary for acquisitions;\n\u2022\nrisks that potential acquisitions may require the disproportionate attention of our senior management, which could distract them from the management of our existing business;\n\u2022\nrisks related to our ability to retain experienced personnel of the acquired company; and\n\u2022\nrisks that certain acquisitions may require regulatory approvals, which could be refused or delayed and which could result in unforeseen regulatory expenses or unfavorable regulatory conditions.\nThese issues could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to finance our operations. The businesses and other assets we acquire in the future may not achieve sufficient revenue or profitability to justify our investment, and any difficulties we may encounter in the integration process could interfere with our operations and reduce operating margins. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuance of our equity securities, incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, and fluctuations in quarterly results and expenses.\n-25-\nTable of Contents\n \nIf we do not manage our anticipated growth effectively, we may not be able to develop or implement the infrastructure necessary to support our operations and could suffer a loss of profitability.\nAlthough we may not be able to achieve similar growth as we have seen since our formation in 2003, or grow at all, in future periods, we expect to continue to significantly expand our facilities, infrastructure, marketing, testing, management, and administrative operations, as well as our financial and accounting controls. This expansion has placed, and will continue to place, strain on our management and administrative, operational, technical, and financial infrastructure. If management is unable to manage growth effectively, the quality of our services, our ability to attract and retain key personnel, and our business or prospects could be harmed significantly.\nTo manage growth effectively, we must:\n\u2022\ncontinue to expand our water management capacity;\n\u2022\nretain key management and augment our management team;\n\u2022\ncontinue to enhance our technology, operations, and financial and management systems;\n\u2022\nmanage multiple relationships with our customers, regulators, suppliers, and other third parties; and\n\u2022\nexpand, train, and manage our employee base.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage any expansion in one or more of these areas, and our failure to do so could harm our ability to maintain or increase revenues and operating results. The expenses incurred in pursuing growth could increase without a corresponding increase in our revenue base, which could decrease operating results and profit margin. In addition, future growth may require us to make significant capital expenditures or incur other significant expenses and may divert the attention of our personnel from our core business operations, any of which could affect our financial performance adversely.\nOperating costs, construction costs, and costs of providing services can be volatile and may rise faster than revenue.\nOur ability to increase rates over time is dependent upon approval of rate increases by the ACC, which may be inclined, for political or other reasons, to limit rate increases. However, our costs are subject to market conditions and other factors, and may increase significantly. For example, costs for chemicals used to treat water and wastewater, as well as costs for power used to operate pumps and other equipment, can be volatile. See \u201c\u2014Operational Factors\u2014We depend on an adequate supply of electricity and chemicals for the delivery of our water, and an interruption in the supply of these inputs or increases in their prices could adversely affect our results of operations.\u201d\nAdditionally, the second largest component of our operating costs after water production is made up of salaries and wages. These costs are affected by the local supply and demand for qualified labor. Other large components of our costs are general insurance, workers\u2019 compensation insurance, employee benefits, and health insurance costs. These costs may increase disproportionately to rate increases authorized by utility regulators and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased operating expenses associated with the expansion of our business may negatively impact our operating income.\nIncreased operating expenses associated with any expansion of our business may negatively impact our income as we, among other things:\n\u2022\nseek to acquire new utilities and service areas;\n\u2022\nexpand geographically in and outside of Arizona;\n\u2022\nmake significant capital expenditures to support our ability to provide services in our existing service areas;\n\u2022\nfund development costs for our system and technology; and\n\u2022\nincur increased general and administrative expenses as we grow.\nAs a result of these factors, we may not sustain or increase our profitability on an ongoing basis.\n-26-\nTable of Contents\n \nThe nature of our business exposes us to various liability claims, which may exceed the level of our insurance coverage and thereby not be reimbursed fully by insurance proceeds, or not be covered by our insurance at all, and may also make it difficult for us to obtain insurance coverage at affordable rates.\nIn recent years, societal factors have resulted in increased litigation and escalating monetary claims against industries and employers. Although the national insurance market currently provides insurance coverage at affordable premiums, there is no guarantee this will continue or that we will continue to be able to obtain coverage against catastrophic claims and losses. While we may self-insure for some risks in the future, should an uninsured or underinsured loss occur, we may be unable to meet our obligations as they become due.\nThe operation of our utilities is subject to the normal risks of occupancy as well as the additional risks of receiving, processing, treating, and disposing of water and waste materials. As a safeguard, we currently maintain general liability and workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage, subject to deductibles at levels we believe are sufficient to cover future claims made during the respective policy periods. However, we may be exposed to multiple claims, including workers\u2019 compensation claims, that do not exceed our deductibles, and, as a result, we could incur significant out-of-pocket costs that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, the cost of insurance policies may increase significantly upon renewal of those policies as a result of general rate increases for the type of insurance we carry as well as our historical experience and experience in our industry. Our future claims may exceed the coverage level of our insurance, and insurance may not continue to be available on economically reasonable terms, or at all. If we are required to pay significantly higher premiums for insurance, are not able to maintain insurance coverage at affordable rates, or if we must pay amounts in excess of claims covered by our insurance, we could experience higher costs that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur operations of regulated utilities are currently located exclusively in the state of Arizona, and more specifically approximately 90.9% of our active service connections are within a single municipality, which increases the impact of local conditions on our results of operations.\nThe customers of our regulated utilities are currently located exclusively in the state of Arizona and 90.9% of our active service connections are located in the City of Maricopa, Arizona. As a result, we cannot diversify or mitigate the risks presented by local regulatory, economic, political, demographic, and weather conditions in this area. An adverse change in any of these conditions would therefore affect our profitability, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows more significantly than if our utilities operated more broadly in other geographic areas.\nWe depend on an adequate supply of electricity and chemicals for the delivery of our water, and an interruption in the supply of these inputs or increases in their prices could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe rely on purchased electrical power to operate the wells and pumps that are needed in order to supply potable and recycled water to our customers. An extended interruption in power supply that we cannot remediate through the use of backup generators could adversely affect our ability to continue these operations. Electrical power costs are beyond our control and can increase unpredictably in substantial amounts. Under these circumstances, our cash flows between our general rate case filings and our earnings may be adversely affected until the ACC has authorized a rate increase.\nIn addition, we require bulk supplies of chemicals for water and wastewater treatment, and if we were to suffer an interruption of supply that we cannot replace quickly, we might not be able to perform these functions adequately. Supply chain constraints may result in increased costs of supplies, products and materials that are critical to or used in the Company's business operations. Also, some chemicals are available from a single source or a limited number of sources. There is no assurance that these suppliers will continue to produce the chemicals in the quantities and quality and at the times they are needed. Moreover, the replacement of any of these suppliers could lead to significant delays and increase in our costs.\nService interruptions, including due to any disruption or problem at our facilities could increase our expenses.\nA natural disaster (such as an earthquake, fire, or flood) or an act of terrorism could cause substantial delays in our operations, damage or destroy our equipment or facilities, and cause us to incur additional expenses and lose revenue. The insurance we maintain against natural disasters may not be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case, which would require us to expend significant resources to replace any destroyed assets, thereby materially and adversely affecting our financial condition and prospects.\n-27-\nTable of Contents\n \nOther global incidents, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a similar effect of disrupting our business to the extent they reach and impact the service areas in which we operate, the availability of supplies we need, the customers we serve, or the employees who operate our businesses. See \u201c\u2014Market and Financial Factors\u2014The recent COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, cash flows, and financial position\u201d for additional information.\nClimate variability may cause increased volatility in weather and may impact water usage and related revenue or require additional expenditures, all of which may not be fully recoverable in rates or otherwise.\nThe issue of climate variability is receiving increasing attention nationally and worldwide. There is consensus among climate scientists that there will be worsening of weather volatility in the future associated with climate variability. Many climate variability predictions present several potential challenges to water and wastewater utilities, including us, such as:\n\u2022\nincreased frequency and duration of droughts;\n\u2022\nchallenges associated with changes in temperature or increases in ocean levels;\n\u2022\npotential degradation of water quality;\n\u2022\ndecreases in available water supply and changes in water usage patterns;\n\u2022\nincreased precipitation and flooding;\n\u2022\nincreased frequency and severity of storms and other weather events;\n\u2022\nincreases in disruptions in service;\n\u2022\nincreased costs to repair damaged facilities; or\n\u2022\nincreased costs to reduce risks associated with the increasing frequency and severity of natural events, including to improve the resiliency and reliability of our water and wastewater treatment and conveyance facilities and systems.\nBecause of the uncertainty of weather volatility related to climate variability, we cannot predict its potential impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Furthermore, laws and regulations have been enacted that seek to reduce or limit greenhouse gas emissions and require additional reporting and monitoring, and these regulations may become more pervasive or stringent in light of changing governmental agendas and priorities, although the exact nature and timing of these changes is uncertain. There can be no assurance that we would be able to recover any expenditures or costs associated with the impact of climate variability and related laws and regulations on a timely basis, or at all, for our regulated utilities through the rate setting process.\nDoing business in jurisdictions other than Arizona may present unforeseen regulatory, legal, and operational challenges that could impede or delay our operations or adversely affect our profitability.\nWe may decide to pursue growth opportunities in states other than Arizona. Other states may present substantially different regulatory frameworks, and we may have difficulty acquiring the necessary approvals and permits or complying with environmental, health and safety, or quality standards. In addition, it may become more costly or difficult for us to comply with a multitude of standards and requirements across multiple states.\nOther states may also expose us to new legal precedents, condemnation risks, and liability concerns based on state legislation or case law.\nOur cost structure in other states may be significantly different than our current cost structure due to regional differences. For example, our cost structure may be significantly impacted by differences in labor and energy costs in other markets and the significant portion of overall production costs that they represent.\nWe may have difficulty accomplishing our growth strategy within and outside of our current service areas. This would cause us to rely more heavily on regulatory rate increases to increase our revenues.\nOur ability to expand our business, both within our current service areas and into new areas, involves significant risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nnot receiving or maintaining necessary regulatory permits, licenses, or approvals;\n\u2022\ndownturns in economic or population growth and development in our service areas;\n-28-\nTable of Contents\n \n\u2022\nrisks related to planning and commencing new operations, including inaccurate assessment of the demand for water, engineering and construction difficulties, and inability to begin operations as scheduled;\n\u2022\ndroughts or water shortages that could increase water conservation efforts to a point that materially reduces revenue;\n\u2022\nregulatory restrictions or other factors that could adversely affect our access to sources of water supply;\n\u2022\nour potential inability to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or to form the relationships with developers and municipalities necessary to form strategic partnerships; and\n\u2022\nbarriers to entry presented by existing water utilities in prospective service areas.\nIf we are unable to execute our growth strategy effectively, we will need to rely more heavily on regulatory rate increases to increase our revenue. However, there can be no assurance that the regulatory authorities will approve any rate increases.\nAny failure of our network of treatment facilities, water and wastewater pipes and water reservoirs could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation.\nOur utilities distribute water and collect wastewater through an extensive network of pipes and store water in reservoirs located across our service areas. A failure of major pipes or reservoirs could result in injuries and property damage for which we may be liable. The failure of major pipes and reservoirs may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our network in order to conduct repairs. Any failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to customers and to meet the water and wastewater delivery requirements prescribed by applicable utility regulators, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, and reputation.\nRisks associated with the collection, treatment, and disposal of wastewater and the operation of water utilities may impose significant costs that may not be covered by insurance, which could result in increased insurance premiums.\nThe wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal operations of our utilities are subject to substantial regulation and involve significant environmental risks. If collection or sewage systems fail, overflow, or do not operate properly, untreated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers, potentially causing damage to persons or property, injury to the environment including aquatic life, and economic damages, which may not be recoverable in rates. This risk is most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding, which are the main causes of sewer overflow and system failure. Liabilities resulting from such damage could adversely and materially affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, in the event that we are deemed liable for any damage caused by overflow, losses might not be covered by insurance policies, and such losses may make it difficult to secure insurance in the future at acceptable insurance premium rates. Similarly, any related business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies, which would also make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable insurance premium rates.\nWe may also incur liabilities under environmental laws and regulations requiring investigations and cleanup of environmental contamination at our properties or at off-site locations where there have been adverse environmental impacts. The discovery of previously unknown conditions, or the imposition of cleanup obligations in the future, could result in significant costs, and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and liquidity. Such remediation losses may not be covered by insurance policies and may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable insurance premium rates.\nContamination of the water supplied by us may result in disruption in our services, loss of credibility, lower demand for our services, and potential liability that could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur water supplies are subject to contamination, including contamination from compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems, pollution resulting from man-made sources (such as perchlorate and methyl tertiary butyl ether), and possible biological terrorist attacks. Contamination of water sources can lead to human death and illness, damage to natural resources and other parts of the environment, and cause other harms. Among other things, if we are found to be liable for consequences of water contamination arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other damage, we would be subject to civil or criminal enforcement actions, litigation, and other proceedings or clean up obligations. Further, our insurance policies may not apply or be sufficient to cover the costs of these claims, which could be significant.\nCleaning up water sources can be very expensive and if we are required to do so, it could have a material and adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. In the event that our water supply is contaminated, we may have to interrupt or stop the use of that water supply until we are able to treat the water or to substitute the supply of water from another \n-29-\nTable of Contents\n \nwater source, including, in some cases, through the purchase of water from a supplier. We may incur significant costs in order to warn consumers and to treat the contaminated source through expansion of current treatment facilities or development of new treatment methods. Using a new water source is generally associated with increased costs compared to an existing water source and, as indicated above, purchasing water is typically more expensive than obtaining the water from other means. If we are unable to treat or substitute our water supply in a cost-effective manner, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, and reputation may be adversely affected. We may not be able to recover costs associated with treating contaminated water or developing new sources of supply through the rate setting process or through insurance.\nWe are subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks, which make us vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatory oversight or other sanctions.\nWater and wastewater utilities, including Palo Verde and Santa Cruz, have large customer bases and as a result are exposed to public criticism regarding, among other things, the reliability of their water and wastewater services, the quality of water provided, the timeliness and accuracy of bills that are provided for such services, and the quality of customer service. Adverse publicity and negative customer sentiment may render regulators and government officials less likely to view us in a favorable light, and may cause us to be susceptible to less favorable regulatory outcomes, as well as increased regulatory oversight, lower rates, and more stringent regulatory requirements. Unfavorable regulatory outcomes may include the enactment of more stringent laws and regulations governing our operations, as well as fines, penalties or other sanctions or requirements. The imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are subject to industrial risks that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe operations of our water and wastewater treatment plants involve physical, chemical, and biological processes and the use of pumps, generators, and other industrial equipment. As a result, our operations are subject to various industrial risks, including chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases, effects resulting from confined operating spaces, fires, explosions, mechanical failures, storage tank leaks, and electric shock. These risks can result in personal injury, loss of life, catastrophic damage to or destruction of property and equipment or environmental damage, and related legal proceedings, including those commenced by regulators, neighbors, or others. They may also result in an unanticipated interruption or suspension of our operations and the imposition of liability. The loss or shutdown over an extended period of operations at any of our treatment facilities or any losses relating to these risks could have a material adverse impact on our profitability, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nThe novel coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") global pandemic could adversely affect our business operations, cash flows, and financial position to an extent that is difficult to predict. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected economies, supply chains, workforce participation and financial markets across the globe. While the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material effect on our business operations, results of operations, cash flows, and financial position for the year ended December 31, 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic and the related responses from government authorities could adversely impact us in a number of ways, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\ndisruptions to our operations and business activities, including any closures of offices or facilities, and to those of governmental agencies regulating our business, suppliers, customers, and other business partners;\n\u2022\nreduced demand for our water and wastewater services from our commercial customers, particularly as businesses are shutdown; \n\u2022\ngreater difficulty in collecting customer receivables; \n\u2022\na slowdown or disruption in the supply chain for the supplies used in our operations, including chemicals used to treat water and wastewater, in addition to higher costs;\n\u2022\nlimitations on employee resources and availability, including due to sickness, government restrictions, labor supply shortages, and the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people; \n\u2022\npotential legislative or regulatory efforts to impose new requirements on our operations;\n-30-\nTable of Contents\n \n\u2022\na continuation of worsening of general economic conditions, including increased inflation;\n\u2022\nan increase in the cost or the difficulty to obtain debt or equity financing could affect our financial condition or future investment opportunities; and\n\u2022\nan increase in regulatory restrictions or continued market volatility could hinder our ability to execute strategic business activities, including acquisitions, as well as negatively impact our stock price.\nThe spread of the COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including additional cybersecurity measures, employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are prudent to support the well-being of our employees, customers, suppliers, business partners, and others. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed. \nAdditionally, the COVID-19 pandemic could affect our internal controls over financial reporting as a portion of our workforce is required to work from home and therefore new processes, procedures, and controls could be required to respond to changes in our business environment. Further, should any key employees become ill from COVID-19 and unable to work, the attention of the management team could be diverted.\nAny of the foregoing could adversely affect our business operations, results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. The potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may also impact our other risk factors described in this \"Risk Factors\" section. More recently, new variants of COVID-19, such as the Delta and Omicron variants, that are more contagious than previous strains have emerged. Accordingly, the ultimate extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations, results of operations, cash flows, and financial position, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, continuously evolving and cannot be predicted. This includes, but is not limited to, the duration and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic; its severity; the emergence and severity of its variants; the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, such as the availability and efficacy of vaccines (particularly with respect to emerging strains of the virus) and potential hesitancy to utilize them; general economic factors, such as increased inflation; supply chain constraints; labor supply issues; restrictions on travel and transportation, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.\n \nSee \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014COVID-19 Update,\u201d included in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K, for additional information. \nIf the general public perceives recycled water to be unsafe, we will have difficulty executing our business plan and could face a loss of revenue.\nOur Total Water Management model emphasizes the maximum use of recycled water for non-potable purposes. To implement this model, we cultivate relationships with developers, municipalities, and members of the communities we serve and focus on educating them regarding the benefits and safety of recycled water. If the recycled water supplied to customers is contaminated, either as a result of terrorism, system failure, pipeline, or other causes, public perception regarding the safety of recycled water would likely suffer, regardless of whether we are at fault and potentially even if the contaminated water was supplied by another person. Public perception of an unsafe water supply would harm our business, particularly with respect to our ability to implement water recycling as a key element of our business strategy.\nMarket and Financial Factors\nWe will need additional capital to grow our business, and additional financing may not be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all.\nAdequate funds to support our growth may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us. We may need to raise additional funds to support more rapid expansion, improve our facilities and infrastructure, develop new and enhanced technologies, or respond to evolving regulatory standards. We may experience difficulty in raising the necessary capital due to volatility in the capital markets or increases in the cost of infrastructure finance. Increasingly stringent bond rating standards could make it more difficult for us to finance our growth by issuing tax-exempt bonds as we have in the past. In addition, we require regulatory approval from the ACC for some means of raising capital, such as issuance of debt by our regulated utilities, and approval may be denied or delayed. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not \n-31-\nTable of Contents\n \nbe able to take advantage of expansion opportunities, make the capital expenditures necessary to support our growth, or otherwise execute our strategic plan.\nForeclosure rates in our service areas, as well as other factors affecting real estate development, could affect the growth of our regulated customer base or result in a decline in our revenue.\nA slowdown or severe downturn in the housing market could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\u00a0During periods of economic distress, there may be an increase in home foreclosures and vacancies. For example, during the economic downturn beginning in 2008, our utilities experienced an increase in the number of vacant homes, reaching a peak of 4,020 vacant connections as of February 28, 2009, approximately 11.9% of our total connections at the time.  Accordingly, in the event of an economic downturn, we may experience a material reduction in revenues. Although the U.S. economy and housing market continue to perform well, we cannot predict the overall trajectory of the market.\u00a0Our growth depends significantly on increased residential and commercial development in our service areas, and if developers or builders are unable to complete additional residential and commercial projects, our revenue may decline.\nOur existing indebtedness could affect our business adversely and limit our ability to plan for or respond to growth opportunities, and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our liquidity needs.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had total indebtedness of $113.1 million. In addition, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Our indebtedness could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain future additional financing we may need to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other corporate requirements; and\n\u2022\nlimiting, by the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt agreements, our ability to borrow additional funds and to pay dividends.\nOur ability to incur significant future indebtedness will depend in part on our ability to generate cash flow. This ability is affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if we are unable to borrow money or otherwise generate funds sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, we may be unable to plan for or respond to growth opportunities, which could adversely affect our operating results and business prospects.\nOur growth depends significantly on increased residential and commercial development in our service areas, and if developers or builders are unable to complete additional residential and commercial projects, our revenue may not increase.\nThe growth of our customer base depends almost entirely on the success of developers in developing residential and commercial properties within our CC&N areas. A CC&N is a permit issued by the ACC allowing a public service corporation to serve a specified area, and preventing other public service corporations from offering the same services within the specified area, which we refer to as \u201cservice areas.\u201d Real estate development is a cyclical industry and the growth rate of development, especially residential development, from 2006 through 2019, both nationally and in Arizona had been below historical rates. During the second half of 2020, residential real estate development began to rise to similar 2006 rates, although there is no guarantee that such growth will be sustained or continue to increase. The sale of, for instance, single family residences is affected by a number of national and regional economic factors, including:\n\u2022\ninterest rates and general levels of economic output;\n\u2022\nlevels of activity in the local real estate market;\n\u2022\nthe state of domestic credit markets, mortgage standards, and availability of credit;\n\u2022\ncompetition from other builders and other projects in the area and other states;\n\u2022\nfederal programs to assist home purchasers;\n\u2022\ncosts and availability of labor and materials;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulations affecting land development, home building, and mortgage financing;\n\u2022\navailability of financing for development and for home purchasers;\n\u2022\nchanges in the income tax treatment relating to real property ownership;\n-32-\nTable of Contents\n \n\u2022\nunexpected increases in development costs;\n\u2022\nincreased commute times and fuel costs that may adversely affect the desirability of outlying suburbs;\n\u2022\navailability of, among other things, other utilities, adequate transportation, and school facilities; and\n\u2022\nenvironmental problems with such land.\nWhile many developers presently hold necessary zoning approvals, land development within our service areas could also be affected by changes in governmental policies, including, but not limited to, governmental policies to restrict or control development. This may include, for example, actions by the local school districts to restrict admissions to local schools because of inadequate classroom space or, because of other problems, such as failure by local municipalities to approve plats for the development. An increase in current residential foreclosure rates or a deep or prolonged slowdown of the development process and the related absorption rate within the various developments in our service areas because of any or all of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect growth of our customer base and the generation of revenue.\nMany national builders and developers in our service areas own or control substantial amounts of the developable land in these areas. There can be no assurance that these builders and developers have the financial capability to continue and complete their developments.\nTechnology Factors\nOur information technology systems may be vulnerable to unauthorized external or internal access due to hacking, ransomware, viruses, or other cybersecurity breaches.\nAs operators of critical infrastructure, we may face a heightened risk of cyberattacks from internal or external sources. For example, a hacker accessed a Florida water treatment plant's control system and attempted to increase the amount of lye used to treat the water to a potentially dangerous level.  Unauthorized access to confidential information located or stored on these systems could negatively and materially impact our customers, employees, suppliers and other third parties. Further, third parties, including vendors, suppliers and contractors, who perform certain services for us or administer and maintain our sensitive information, could also be targets of cyberattacks and unauthorized access. While we have instituted safeguards to protect our information technology systems, those safeguards may not always be effective due to the evolving nature of cyberattacks and cyber vulnerabilities. We cannot guarantee that such protections will be completely successful in the event of a cyberattack.\nIf our information technology systems, or that of third parties on which we rely on, are affected by a significant cyber breach, this could result in, among other things, a significant disruption to our operations; costly investigations and remediation; misappropriation of confidential information of the Company or that of our customers, employees, business partners or others; litigation and potential liability; enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities; loss of customers and contracts; harm to our reputation; and a loss of management time, attention and resources from our regular business operations, any of which could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, and cash flows. These types of events, either impacting our facilities or the industry in general, could also cause us to incur additional security and insurance related costs. \nOur cyber insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may not cover the total loss or damage caused by a breach. In addition, the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident may not be covered by insurance. \nWe rely on information technology systems to assist with the management of our business and customer relationships. A disruption or interruption of these systems could adversely affect our business and operations.\nOur information technology systems, which includes information technology functions that are outsourced to various third-party service providers and software vendors, are an integral part of our business. For example, our information technology systems allow us, among other things, to bill our customers, provide customer service through our call center, manage certain financial records, track assets and accounts receivable collections, read water meters remotely, identify high water usage, and identify water theft from disconnected meters.   A disruption of our information technology systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently, which in turn could cause our business to suffer and cause our results of operations to be reduced.\nFurther, our information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:\n\u2022\npower loss, computer systems failures, and internet, telecommunications, or data network failures;\n-33-\nTable of Contents\n \n\u2022\noperator negligence or improper operation by, or supervision of, employees;\n\u2022\nphysical and electronic loss of customer data, including as a result of or security breaches, cyberattacks, misappropriation, and similar events;\n\u2022\ncomputer viruses;\n\u2022\nintentional acts of vandalism and similar events; and\n\u2022\nfires, floods, earthquakes, and other natural disasters.\nDamages or interruptions due to any of the foregoing could result in, among other things, difficulties managing and operating our business efficiently, such as with the timely issuances of billings, physical and electronic loss of customer, employee or financial data, security breaches, misappropriation of property, and other adverse consequences. The lack of redundancy for some of our information technology systems, including billing systems, could exacerbate the impact of any of the foregoing events. Additionally, we may not be successful in further developing, implementing or acquiring technology to enable us to continue to operate at our current level of efficiency or to meet the future needs of our business. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nMaintaining our operational technology and information technology systems or implementing new systems could result in higher than expected costs or otherwise adversely impact our internal controls environment, operations, and profitability.\nUpgrades and improvements to computer systems and networks, or the implementation of new systems, may require substantial amounts of management\u2019s time and financial resources to complete, and may also result in system or network defects or operational errors due to multiple factors, including employees\u2019 ability to effectively use such new or upgraded system. While we continue to implement technology to improve our business processes and customer interactions, any technical or other difficulties in transitioning, upgrading or improving existing or implementing new technology systems may increase costs beyond those anticipated and have an adverse or disruptive effect on our operations and reporting processes, including our internal control over financial reporting. We may also experience difficulties integrating current systems with new or upgraded systems, which may impact our ability to serve our customers effectively or efficiently. Although we make efforts to minimize any adverse impact on our controls, business and operations, we cannot assure that all such impacts have been or will be mitigated, and any such impacts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe concentration of our stock ownership with our officers, directors, certain stockholders, and their affiliates will limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur directors, executive officers, and stockholders holding more than 5% of our capital stock and their affiliates beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 54% of our outstanding common stock, including 45% beneficially owned in the aggregate by our former director, William S. Levine and current director Jonathan L. Levine. As a result, these stockholders are able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of us or our assets. This concentration of ownership could limit your ability to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over us. There can be no assurance that their interests will not conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nOur common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above your purchase price.\nThe market price for our common stock is likely to be volatile, due to many factors, outside our control, including those described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, as well as the following:\n\u2022\nour operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry compared to market expectations;\n\u2022\nconditions that impact demand for our services;\n\u2022\nfuture announcements concerning our business or our competitors\u2019 businesses;\n-34-\nTable of Contents\n \n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nthe size of our public float;\n\u2022\ncoverage by or changes in financial estimates by investment analysts or failure to meet their expectations;\n\u2022\nthe market\u2019s perception towards our reduced disclosure as a result of being a \"smaller reporting company\u201d as defined in the Exchange Act;\n\u2022\nmarket and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations which adversely affect our industry or us;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles;\n\u2022\nchanges in senior management or key personnel;\n\u2022\nissuances, exchanges, or sales, or expected issuances, exchanges, or sales of our capital stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in our dividend policy;\n\u2022\nadverse resolution of new or pending litigation against us; and\n\u2022\nchanges in general market, economic, and political conditions in the U.S., and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural disasters, terrorist attacks, acts of war, other geopolitical uncertainties, public health concerns (including health epidemics or outbreaks of communicable diseases such as the COVID-19 pandemic),and responses to such events.\nIn addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies in our industry. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.\nOur failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as a public company could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price.\nWe have to comply with Section\u00a0404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\"). Section\u00a0404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Additionally, once we are no longer deemed a smaller reporting company that is a non-accelerated filer, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required pursuant to Section\u00a0404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. The rules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing, and possible remediation.\nInternal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We may encounter problems or delays for any requested improvements and receiving a favorable attestation in connection with the attestation to be provided by our independent registered public accounting firm after we cease to be a smaller reporting company that is a non-accelerated filer. If our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on our internal controls after we cease to be a smaller reporting company that is a non-accelerated filer, investors could lose confidence in our financial information and the price of our common stock could decline.\nAdditionally, the existence of any material weakness or significant deficiency would require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weakness or significant deficiency and management may not be able to remediate any such material weakness or significant deficiency in a timely manner. The existence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, and cause stockholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business and share price.\n-35-\nTable of Contents\n \nWe cannot assure you that we will pay dividends on our common stock, and our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe currently intend to continue to pay a regular monthly dividend on our common stock of $0.02458 per share ($0.29496 per share annually), or an aggregate of approximately $6.6 million on an annual basis. However, our future dividend policy is subject to our compliance with applicable law, and depends on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, level of indebtedness, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions in our debt agreements and in any preferred stock we may issue in the future, business prospects, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Dividend payments are not mandatory or guaranteed; there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay a dividend in the future.\nDelaware law, certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and regulations of the ACC may prevent efforts by our stockholders to change the direction or management of the Company.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nonly allowing our board of directors, Chairman of our board of directors, Chief Executive Officer, or President to call special meetings of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nsetting forth specific procedures regarding how our stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nrequiring advance notice and duration of ownership requirements for stockholder proposals;\n\u2022\npermitting our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval; and\n\u2022\nlimiting the rights of stockholders to amend our bylaws.\nThese provisions could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you desire. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team.\nAdditionally, the ACC must determine that certain types of transactions will not impair our financial status, prevent us from attracting capital at fair and reasonable terms, or impair our ability to provide safe, reasonable, and adequate service. Pursuant to this regulatory mandate, the ACC may impose conditions that could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company.\nTaking advantage of the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a \"smaller reporting company\" as defined in the Exchange Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies including, but not limited to, (i)\u00a0not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section\u00a0404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (so long as we also remain a non-accelerated filer); (ii)\u00a0reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and (iii)\u00a0reduced disclosure obligations regarding financial statements. \nWe may take advantage of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies for so long as our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenue is less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter. \nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result of our taking advantage of these exemptions and as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. \n-36-\nTable of Contents\n \nGeneral Risk Factors\nSubstantial future sales of our common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock price.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares.\nWe have also filed a registration statement registering under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), the shares of our common stock reserved for issuance in respect of stock options and other incentive awards granted to our officers and certain of our employees. If these officers or employees cause a large number of securities to be sold in the public market, such sales could also reduce the trading price of our common stock and impede our ability to raise future capital.\nWe incur costs as a result of being a public company in the U.S.\nAs a public company in the U.S., we incur significant legal, accounting, insurance, and other expenses, including costs associated with U.S. public company reporting requirements. The expenses incurred by U.S. public companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action, and potentially civil litigation.\nIf investment analysts cease to publish research or reports about our business or if they publish negative evaluations of our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that investment analysts publish about us or our business. However, if no or few analysts commence coverage of the Company, the trading price of our stock would likely decrease. Even if we do obtain such analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts covering our business downgrade their evaluations of our stock, the price of our common stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover our common stock, we could lose visibility in the market for our stock, which in turn could cause our common stock price to decline.\nIf our operating and financial performance in any given period does not meet the guidance that we provide to the public or the expectations of investment analysts, our stock price may decline.\nWe may provide public guidance on our expected operating and financial results for future periods. Any such guidance will be comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this Form 10-K and in our other public filings with the SEC and public statements. Whether or not we provide guidance, investment analysts may publish their estimates of our future financial performance. Our actual results may not always be in line with or exceed any guidance we have provided or the expectations of investment analysts, especially in times of economic uncertainty. If, in the future, our operating or financial results for a particular period do not meet any guidance we provide or the expectations of investment analysts or if we or investment analysts reduce estimates of our performance for future periods, the market price of our common stock may decline.\n-37-\nTable of Contents\n ", "item7": ">ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following management\u2019s discussion and analysis of Global Water Resources, Inc.'s (the \"Company\", \"GWRI\", \"we\", or \"us\") financial condition and results of operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d) relate to the year ended December 31, 2021 and should be read together with the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a water resource management company that owns, operates, and manages water, wastewater, and recycled water utilities in strategically located communities, principally in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona. GWRI seeks to deploy an integrated approach, which the Company refers to as \u201cTotal Water Management\". Total Water Management is a comprehensive approach to water utility management that reduces demand on scarce non-renewable water sources and costly renewable water supplies, in a manner that ensures sustainability and greatly benefits communities both environmentally and economically. This approach employs a series of principles and practices that can be tailored to each community: \n\u2022\nReuse of recycled water, either directly or to non-potable uses, through aquifer recharge, or direct potable reuse;\n\u2022\nRegional planning;\n\u2022\nUse of advanced technology and data;\n\u2022\nEmploying respected subject matter experts and retaining thought and application leaders; \n\u2022\nLeading outreach and educational initiatives to ensure all stakeholders including customers, development partners, regulators, and utility staff are knowledgeable on the principles and practices of our Total Water Management approach; and\n\u2022\nEstablishing partnerships with communities, developers, and industry stakeholders to gain support of our Total Water Management principles and practices.  \nCOVID-19 Update\nIn late 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic. Since that time, government authorities around the world implemented numerous measures to try to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place, stay-at-home, or total lock-down (or similar) orders and business limitations and shutdowns. Throughout 2021, states and localities were in the midst of a vaccine distribution program; however, the rate of vaccination has been slowed by vaccine hesitancy in some areas. More recently, new variants of COVID-19, such as the Delta and Omicron variants, that are more contagious than previous strains have emerged. The spread of these new strains have caused many government authorities to reimplement the aforementioned measures to try to reduce the spread that had become less prevalent.\nOur water and wastewater services are essential services and we intend to continue to provide those services for our customers. As a result of the economic hardships caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we voluntarily agreed not to disconnect customers or charge late fees during the year ended December 31, 2020. \nHowever, we resumed disconnections starting February 9, 2021. In 2020, we also expanded our customer assistance program to include a larger customer base, while increasing the annual maximum benefit and including additional qualifying categories to include disabled veterans, deployed service members, furloughed workers, and customers with a medical hardship. As of December 31, 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material impact on uncollectible accounts.  However, we continue to face various uncertainties related to the impact of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic on the overall economy and our business, including whether we will continue to be able to sustain our level of bad debt expense.\nWe continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations, including how it will impact our customers, employees, suppliers, vendors, and business partners. While the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material effect on our business operations, results of operations, cash flows, and financial position for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we are unable to predict the ultimate extent to which our business operations, results of operations, cash flows, and financial position will be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our \n-42-\nTable of Contents\n \nbusiness operations, results of operations, cash flows, and financial position will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, continuously evolving and cannot be predicted. This includes, but is not limited to, the duration and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic; its severity; the emergence and severity of its variants; the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, such as the availability and efficacy of vaccines (particularly with respect to emerging strains of the virus) and potential hesitancy to utilize them; general economic factors, such as increased inflation; supply chain constraints; labor supply issues; restrictions on travel and transportation; and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. \nFurther, our current results and financial condition discussed herein may not be indicative of future operating results and trends. Refer to \u201cRisk Factors\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for additional risks we face due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBusiness Outlook\n2020 and 2021 continued the trend of positive growth in new connections. According to the 2020 U.S. Census Data, the Phoenix metropolitan statistical area (\u201cMSA\u201d) is the 11th largest MSA in the U.S. and had a population of 4.8 million, an increase of 14% over the 4.2 million people reported in the 2010 Census. Metropolitan Phoenix continues to grow due to its low-cost housing, excellent weather, large and growing universities, a diverse employment base, and low taxes. The Employment and Population Statistics Department of the State of Arizona predicts that the Phoenix Metropolitan area will have a population of 5.7 million people by 2030 and 6.5 million by 2040. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, even though Arizona\u2019s unemployment rate decreased by 5.1%, the state ranked in the top fifteen nationally for job growth.\nAccording to the W.P. Carey School of Business Greater Phoenix Blue Chip Real Estate Consensus Panel (\"Greater Phoenix Blue Chip Panel\", the single family market experienced a period of very rapid growth in 2021 with approximately 31,000 building permits issued. Strong underlying demand and an extreme shortage of existing inventory pushed prices up rapidly. The Greater Phoenix Blue Chip Panel expects this to continue but at a slower pace as lack of product and affordability issues slow demand. Building permits are forecasted to increase to 35,000 and 36,000 in 2022 and 2023, respectively. \nWe believe that our utilities and service areas are directly in the anticipated path of growth primarily in the metropolitan Phoenix area. Market data indicates that our service areas currently incorporate a large portion of the final platted lots, partially finished lots, and finished lots in metropolitan Phoenix. Management believes that we are well-positioned to benefit from the near-term growth in metropolitan Phoenix due to the availability of lots and existing infrastructure in place within our services\u00a0areas.\nFactors Affecting our Results of Operations\nOur financial condition and results of operations are influenced by a variety of industry-wide factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\npopulation and community growth;\n\u2022\neconomic and environmental utility regulation;\n\u2022\neconomic environment;\n\u2022\nthe need for infrastructure investment;\n\u2022\nproduction and treatment costs;\n\u2022\nweather and seasonality; and\n\u2022\naccess to and quality of water supply.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may impact the degree to which these factors affect our financial condition and results of operations as discussed above under \"COVID-19 Update.\"\nWe are subject to economic regulation by the state regulator, the Arizona Corporation Commission (\u201cACC\u201d). The U.S. federal and state governments also regulate environmental, health and safety, and water quality matters. We continue to execute on our strategy to optimize and focus the Company in order to provide greater value to our customers and shareholders by aiming to deliver predictable financial results, making prudent capital investments, and focusing our efforts on earning an appropriate rate of return on our investments.\nPopulation and Community Growth\n-43-\nPopulation and community growth in the metropolitan Phoenix area served by our utilities have a direct impact on our earnings. An increase or decrease in our active service connections will affect our revenues and variable expenses in a corresponding manner. Our total service connections, including both active service connections and connections to vacant homes, increased 5,024 connections, or 10.2%, from a total of 49,158 as of December 31, 2020 to 54,182 as of December 31, 2021. This increase was due primarily to organic growth in new connections combined with the acquisition of Global Water - Las Quintas Serenas Company, Inc. (\"Las Quintas\").\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have 53,882 active service connections compared to 48,899 active service connections as of December 31, 2020, an increase of 4,983, or 10.2%. As with the increase in total service connections, the increase is due primarily to the organic growth in new connections. Approximately 90.9% of the 53,882 active service connections are serviced by our Global Water - Santa Cruz Water Company, Inc. (\u201cSanta Cruz\u201d) and Global Water - Palo Verde Utilities Company, Inc. (\u201cPalo Verde\u201d) utilities as of December 31, 2021.\nThe graph below presents the historical change in active and total connections for our ongoing operations, adjusting for the July 2015 condemnation of the assets and operations of Valencia Water Company (\"Valencia\") and the May 2016 sale of Willow Valley.\nEconomic and Environmental Utility Regulation\nWe are subject to extensive regulation of our rates by the ACC, which is charged with establishing rates based on the provision of reliable service at a reasonable cost while also providing an opportunity to earn a fair rate of return on rate base for investors of utilities. The ACC uses a historical test year to evaluate whether the plant in service is used and useful, to assess whether costs were prudently incurred, and to set \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d rates. Rate base is typically the depreciated original cost of the plant in service (net\u00a0of contributions in aid of construction (\u201cCIAC\u201d) and advances in aid of construction (\u201cAIAC\u201d) which are funds or property provided to a utility under the terms of a main extension agreement, the value of which may be refundable), that has been determined to have been \u201cprudently invested\u201d and \u201cused and useful\u201d, although the reconstruction cost of the utility plant may also be considered in determining the rate base. The ACC also decides on an applicable capital structure based on actual or hypothetical analyses. The ACC determines a \u201crate of return\u201d on that rate base, which includes the approved capital \n-44-\nstructure and the actual cost of debt and a fair and reasonable cost of equity based on the ACC's judgment. The overall revenue requirement for rate making purposes is established by multiplying the rate of return by the rate base and adding \u201cprudently\u201d incurred operating expenses for the test year, depreciation, and any applicable pro forma adjustments.\nTo ensure an optimal combination of access to water and water conservation balanced with a fair rate of return for investors, our water utility operating revenue is based on two components: a fixed fee and a consumption or volumetric fee. For our water utilities, the fixed fee, or \u201cbasic service charge,\u201d provides access to water for residential usage and has generally been set at a level to produce 50% of total revenue. The volumetric fee is based on the total volume of water supplied to a given customer after the minimum number of gallons, if any, covered by the basic service charge, multiplied by a price per gallon set by a tariff approved by the ACC. A discount to the volumetric rate applies for customers that use less than an amount specified by the ACC. For all investor-owned water utilities, the ACC requires the establishment of inverted tier conservation oriented rates, meaning that the price of water increases as consumption increases. For wastewater utilities, wastewater collection, and treatment can be based on volumetric or fixed fees. Our wastewater utility services are billed based solely on a fixed fee, determined by the size of the water meter installed. Recycled water is sold on a volumetric basis with no fixed fee component.\nWe are required to file rate cases with the ACC to obtain approval for a change in rates. Rate cases and other rate-related proceedings can take a year or more to complete. As a result, there is frequently a delay, or regulatory lag, between the time of a capital investment or incurrence of an operating expense increase and when those costs are reflected in rates. In normal conditions, it would not be uncommon to see us file for a rate increase every three years based on year one being the test year, year two being the rate case filing year, and year three being the rate case award year. However, based on our settlement with the ACC in 2014 and extended new rate phase-in period, we did not initiate the next rate case on this timeline. On August 28, 2020, 12 of our 18 regulated utilities each filed a rate case application with the ACC for water, wastewater, and recycled water rates, as well as the consolidation of water and/or wastewater rates for certain of the utilities, using the year ending December 31, 2019 as the test year for the rate case. Refer to \u201c\u2014Rate Case Activity\u201d and \u201c\u2014Corporate Transactions\u2014ACC Rate Case\u201d for additional information.\nOur water and wastewater operations are also subject to extensive United States federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, health and safety, the quality of the water we deliver to our customers, water allocation rights, and the manner in which we collect, treat, and discharge wastewater. We are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations. The ACC also sets conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver. We incur substantial costs associated with compliance with environmental, health and safety, and water quality regulation.\nEnvironmental, health and safety, and water quality regulations are complex and change frequently, and they have tended to become more stringent over time. As newer or stricter standards are introduced, they could increase our operating expenses. We would generally expect to recover expenses associated with compliance for environmental and health and safety standards through rate increases, but this recovery may be affected by regulatory lag.\nEconomic Environment\nThe growth of our customer base depends almost entirely on the success of developers in developing residential and commercial properties within our service areas. Real estate development is a cyclical industry and development in our service areas is contingent upon construction or acquisition of major public improvements, such as arterial streets, drainage facilities, telephone and electrical facilities, recreational facilities, street lighting, and local in-tract improvements (e.g., site grading). Many of these improvements are built by municipalities with public financing, and municipal resources and access to capital may not be sufficient to support development in areas of rapid population growth. For additional information and risks associated with the economic environment, see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nInfrastructure Investment\nCapital expenditures for infrastructure investment are a component of the rate base on which our regulated utility subsidiaries are allowed to earn an equity return. Capital expenditures for infrastructure provide a basis for earnings growth by expanding our \u201cused and useful\u201d rate base, which is a component of our permitted return on investment and revenue requirement. We are generally able to recover a rate of return on these capital expenditures (return on equity and debt), together with debt service and certain operating costs, through the rates we charge.\nWe have an established capital improvement plan to make targeted capital investments to repair and replace existing infrastructure as needed, address operating redundancy requirements, improve our overall financial performance and expand our infrastructure in areas where growth is occurring. \n-45-\nAdditionally, to reduce our deferred tax liability of approximately $19.4 million resulting from the gain on the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia, we completed in 2020 the planned investments within our capital improvement plan that we determined would qualify under the Internal Revenue Code (\"IRC\") \u00a71033 re-investment criteria pursuant to a favorable Private Letter Ruling with the Internal Revenue Service (the \"IRS\"). Refer to \u201c\u2014Corporate Transactions\u2014Private Letter Ruling\u201d for additional information. \nProduction and Treatment Costs\nOur water and wastewater services require significant production resources and therefore result in significant production costs. Although we are permitted to recover these costs through the rates we charge, regulatory lag can decrease our margins and earnings if production costs or other operating expenses increase significantly before we are able to recover them through increased rates. Our most significant costs include labor, chemicals used to treat water and wastewater, and power used to operate pumps and other equipment. Power and chemical costs can be volatile. However, we employ a variety of technologies and methodologies to minimize costs and maximize operational efficiencies. Additionally, with our Total Water Management approach, whereby we maximize the direct beneficial reuse of recycled water, we can realize significant treatment costs and power savings because smaller volumes of water are required for potable use. Many utilities require that all water be treated to potable standards irrespective of use. Total Water Management focuses on the right water for the right use. Potable water is needed for consumption and recycled water is acceptable for non-potable uses such as irrigation. Non-potable water does not need to be treated for commonly occurring and regulated constituents such as arsenic, or for other current or future human consumption health-based contaminants.\nWeather and Seasonality\nOur ability to meet the existing and future water demands of our customers depends on an adequate supply of water. Drought, overuse of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats, or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water. Also, customer usage of water and recycled water is affected by weather conditions, particularly during the summer. Our water systems generally experience higher demand in the summer due to the warmer temperatures and increased usage by customers for irrigation and other outdoor uses. However, summer weather that is cooler or wetter than average generally suppresses customer water demand and can have a downward effect on our operating revenue and operating income. Conversely, when weather conditions are extremely dry, our business may be affected by government-issued drought-related warnings and/or water usage restrictions that would artificially lower customer demand and reduce our operating revenue. For additional information and risks associated with weather and seasonality, see \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. The limited geographic diversity of our service areas makes the results of our operations more sensitive to the effect of local weather extremes. The second and third quarters of the year are generally those in which water services revenue and wastewater services revenues are highest. Accordingly, interim results should not be considered representative of the results of a full year. \nAccess to and Quality of Water Supply\nIn many areas of Arizona (including certain areas that we service), water supplies are limited and, in some cases, current usage rates exceed sustainable levels for certain water resources. We currently rely predominantly (and are likely to continue to rely) on the pumping of groundwater and the generation and delivery of recycled water for non-potable uses to meet future demands in our service areas. At present, groundwater (and recycled water derived from groundwater) is the primary water supply available to us. In addition, regulatory restrictions on the use of groundwater and the development of groundwater wells, lack of available water rights, drought, overuse of local or regional sources of water, protection of threatened species or habitats, or other factors, including climate change, may limit the availability of ground or surface water. For additional information and risks associated with the access to and quality of water supply, see \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d included in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nRate Case Activity\nOn July\u00a09, 2012, we filed rate applications with the ACC to adjust the revenue requirements for seven utilities. In August 2013, we entered into a settlement agreement with the ACC staff, the Residential Utility Consumers Office, the City of Maricopa, and other parties to the rate case. The settlement required approval by the ACC before it could take effect. In February 2014, the rate case proceedings were completed and the ACC issued Rate Decision No.\u00a074364, approving the settlement agreement. The collective rate increase included a 9.5% return on common equity which contributed to a 15% increase over revenue in 2011.\n-46-\nFor our utilities, adjusting for the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia and the sale of Willow Valley, the settlement provided for a collective aggregate revenue requirement increase of $3.6 million based on 2011 test year service connections, phased-in over time, with the first increase in January 2015 as follows (in thousands, not updated for the Federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTCJA\u201d), refer to \"\u2014Corporate Transactions\u2014ACC Tax Docket\" for further details):\n\u00a0\nIncremental\nCumulative\n2015\n$\n1,083\u00a0\n$\n1,083\u00a0\n2016\n887\u00a0\n1,970\u00a0\n2017\n335\u00a0\n2,305\u00a0\n2018\n335\u00a0\n2,640\u00a0\n2019\n335\u00a0\n2,975\u00a0\n2020\n335\u00a0\n3,310\u00a0\n2021\n335\u00a0\n3,645\u00a0\nWhereas this phase-in of additional revenues was determined using a 2011 test year, to the extent that the number of active service connections increases from 2011 levels, the additional revenues may be greater than the amounts set forth above. On the other hand, if active connections decrease or we experience declining usage per customer, we may not realize all of the anticipated revenues. \nOn September 20, 2018, the ACC issued Rate Decision No. 76901, which set forth the reductions in revenue for our Santa Cruz, Palo Verde, Greater Tonopah, and Northern Scottsdale utilities due to the TCJA. Rate Decision No. 76901 adopted the phase-in approach for the reductions to match the phase-in of our revenue requirement under Rate Decision No. 74364. Refer to \"\n\u2014 \nCorporate Transactions\n \u2014 ACC Tax Docket\"\n for details regarding Decision No. 76901.\nOn August 28, 2020, 12 of our 18 regulated utilities each filed a rate case application with the ACC for water, wastewater, and recycled water rates, as well as the consolidation of water and/or wastewater rates for certain of the utilities, using the year ending December 31, 2019 as the test year for the rate case. Refer to \u201c\u2014 Corporate Transactions \u2014 ACC Rate Case\u201d for additional information.\nICFA Treatment\nFrom 2003 to 2008, we entered into approximately 154 infrastructure coordination and financing agreements (\u201cICFAs\u201d) with developers and landowners covering approximately 275 square miles. Under these agreements, we have a contractual obligation to the developers and landowners to ensure that amongst other things, physical capacity exists through our regulated utilities for water and wastewater to the landowner/developer when needed. We receive fees from the landowner/developer for undertaking these obligations that typically are a negotiated amount per planned equivalent dwelling unit for the specified development or parcel of land. Payments are generally due to us from the landowner/developer based on progress of the development, with a portion due upon signing of the agreement, a portion due upon completion of certain milestones and the final payment due upon final plat approval or sale of the subdivision. The payments are non-refundable. Our investment can be considerable, as we may phase-in the construction of facilities in accordance with a regional master plan, as opposed to a single development.\nWith the issuance of Rate Decision No. 74364, in February 2014, the ACC changed how ICFA funds would be characterized and accounted for going forward. Most notably, the ACC changed the rate treatment of ICFA funds. ICFA funds already received or which had become due prior to the date of Rate Decision No. 74364 were accounted for in accordance with our ICFA revenue recognition policy that had been in place prior to the 2010 Regulatory Rate Decision, wherein the funds received are recognized as revenue once the obligations specified in the ICFA were met. Rate Decision No. 74364 prescribes that of the ICFA funds which come due and are paid subsequent to December 31, 2013, 70% of the ICFA funds will be recorded in the associated utility subsidiary as a hook-up fee (\u201cHUF\u201d) liability, with the remaining 30% to be recorded as deferred revenue, until such time that the HUF tariff is fully funded, after which the remaining funds will be recorded as deferred revenue in accordance with our ICFA revenue recognition policy. A HUF tariff, specifying the dollar value of a HUF for each utility, was approved by the ACC as part of Rate Decision No. 74364. We are responsible for assuring the full HUF value is paid from ICFA proceeds, and recorded in its full amount by predetermined milestones in Rate Decision No. 74364, even if it results in recording less than 30% of the ICFA fee as deferred revenue.\n-47-\nWe account for the portion of future payments received under these agreements allocated to HUF liability as CIAC. However, from the regulator\u2019s perspective, HUFs do not impact rate base until the related funds are expended. These funds are segregated in a separate bank account and used to construct plant assets. The HUF liability is to be relieved once the funds are used for the construction of plant. For facilities required under a hook-up fee or ICFA, we must first use the HUF funds received, after which we may use debt or equity financing for the remainder of construction. The deferred revenue portion of these fees is recognized as revenue once the obligations specified within the applicable ICFA are met, including construction of sufficient operating capacity to serve the customers for which revenue was deferred. \nPursuant to Rate Decision No. 74364, we have agreed not to enter into any new ICFAs, and instead would utilize HUF tariffs, which have become an acceptable industry practice in Arizona. As part of the settlement, a HUF tariff was established for each utility. Existing ICFAs will remain in place, with 70% of future ICFA payments to be recorded as HUFs until the HUF liability is fully funded. The HUF liability is relieved as funds are expended to construct plant, at which time a corresponding amount is recorded to CIAC. The portion of ICFA proceeds not recorded as HUF will be recorded as revenue or deferred revenue, in accordance with our ICFA revenue recognition policy.\nIn addition to ICFAs, we have various line extension agreements with developers and builders, through which funds, water line extensions or wastewater line extensions are provided to us by the developers and are considered refundable advances for construction. These AIACs are subject to refund by us to the developers through annual payments that are computed as a percentage of the total annual gross revenue earned from customers connected to utility services constructed under the agreement over a specified period. Upon the expiration of the agreements\u2019 refunding period, the remaining balance of the AIAC becomes nonrefundable and at that time is considered CIAC. CIAC is amortized as a reduction of depreciation expense over the estimated remaining life of the related utility plant. For rate-making purposes, a utility plant funded by AIAC and CIAC is excluded from rate base. The taxability of AIAC and CIAC was changed with the enactment of the TCJA. Previously, the majority of AIAC and CIAC that we collected were not taxable; however, with the enactment of the TCJA, they are taxable going forward. On November 27, 2018, the ACC ruled that the utility may require that the contributor pay a gross-up to the utility consisting of 55% of the income tax expense with the utility covering the remaining 45% of the income tax expense. Effective January 1, 2021, CIAC and AIAC for regulated water and sewage disposal facility companies will be excluded from income under IRC Section 118.\n Due to the 2021 IRC Section 118 amendment, the Company refunded $1.4 million in developer taxes paid for contributions made after December 31, 2020. \nFor more details regarding the ruling, refer to \"\u2014Corporate Transactions \u2014 ACC Tax Docket.\"\nCorporate Transactions\nStipulated Condemnation of the Operations and Assets of Valencia\nOn July\u00a014, 2015, we closed the stipulated condemnation to transfer the operations and assets of Valencia to the City of Buckeye. Terms of the condemnation were agreed upon through a settlement agreement and stipulated final judgment of condemnation wherein the City of Buckeye acquired all the operations and assets of Valencia and assumed operation of the utility upon close. The City of Buckeye paid the Company $55.0 million at close, plus an additional $0.1 million in working capital adjustments. The City of Buckeye is obligated to pay the Company a growth premium equal to $3,000 for each new water meter installed within Valencia\u2019s prior service areas in the City of Buckeye, for a 20-year period ending December\u00a031, 2034, subject to a maximum payout of $45.0 million over the term of the agreement.\nPrivate Letter Ruling\nOn June 2, 2016, we received a Private Letter Ruling from the IRS that, for purposes of deferring the approximately $19.4 million gain realized from the condemnation of the operations and assets of Valencia, determined that the assets converted upon the condemnation of such assets could be replaced through certain reclamation facility improvements contemplated by the Company under IRC \u00a71033 as property similar or related in service or use.\nPursuant to IRC \u00a71033, as of December 31, 2020 the Company fully deferred the remaining tax liability. \nACC Tax Docket\nOn December 20, 2017, the ACC opened a docket to address the utility ratemaking implications of the TCJA. The ACC subsequently approved an order in February 2018 requiring Arizona utilities to apply regulatory accounting treatment, which includes the use of regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities, to address all impacts from the enactment of the TCJA.\n-48-\nOn September 20, 2018, the ACC issued Rate Decision No. 76901, which set forth the reductions in revenue for our Santa Cruz, Palo Verde, Greater Tonopah, and Northern Scottsdale utilities due to lower corporate tax rates under the TCJA.\u00a0 Rate Decision No. 76901 adopted a phase-in approach for the reductions to match the phase-in of our revenue requirement under Rate Decision No. 74364 enacted in February 2014. In 2021, the final year of the phase-in, the annual  reductions in revenue for our Santa Cruz, Palo Verde, Greater Tonopah, and Northern Scottsdale utilities were approximately $415,000, $669,000, $16,000, and $5,000, respectively. The ACC also approved a carrying cost of 4.25% on regulatory liabilities resulting from the difference of the fully phased-in rates to be applied in 2021 versus the years leading up to 2021 (i.e., 2018 through 2020).\nRate Decision No. 76901, however, did not address the impacts of the TCJA on accumulated deferred income taxes (\u201cADIT\u201d), including excess ADIT (\u201cEADIT\u201d).\u00a0 Following the ACC's request for a proposal, the Company made its proposal in filings on December 19, 2018 and July 1, 2019. ACC Staff reviewed the Company's filing and requested that the Company defer tariff revisions until such revisions can be considered in the next rate case. ACC Staff also requested that the Company defer consideration of the regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities associated with 2018 EADIT amortization.  On July 18, 2019, the Company made a filing proposing these items be deferred to the next rate case. Refer to \" \u2014 Corporate Transactions \u2014 ACC Rate Case\" for additional information regarding the Company's next rate case.   \nOn November 27, 2018, February 20, 2019, February 28, 2019, and January 23, 2020, the ACC adopted orders relating to the funding for income taxes on CIAC and AIAC (which became taxable for our regulated utilities under the TCJA). Those orders 1) require that under the hybrid sharing method, a contributor will pay a gross-up to the utility consisting of 55% of the income tax expense with the utility covering the remaining 45% of the income tax expense; 2) remove the full gross-up method option for Class A and B utilities and their affiliates (which includes all of our utilities); 3) ensure proper ratemaking treatment of a utility using the self-pay method; 4) clarify that pass-through entities that are owned by a \u201cC\u201d corporation can recover tax expense according to methods allowed; and 5) require Class A and B utilities to self-pay the taxes associated with hook-up fee contributions but permit using a portion of the hook-up fees to fund these taxes. The Company's utilities have adopted the hybrid sharing method for income tax on CIAC and AIAC.\nEffective January 1, 2021, contributions made in aid of construction and advances made in aid of construction for regulated water and sewage disposal facility companies will be excluded from income under IRC section 118.\n2020 Common Stock Offering\nOn January 21, 2020, we completed a public offering of 870,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price per share of $12.50, for gross proceeds of $10.9\u00a0million. On January 30, 2020, we issued an additional 130,000 shares of common stock at the public offering price of $12.50 per share, for gross proceeds of $1.6\u00a0million, resulting in total proceeds from the offering of approximately $12.5\u00a0million. The issuance of the additional shares was completed pursuant to the exercise in full of the underwriter's over-allotment option. We received net proceeds of approximately $11.5\u00a0million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses paid by us, which collectively totaled approximately $1.0\u00a0million.\nACC Rate Case\nOn August 28, 2020, 12 of our 18 regulated utilities each filed a rate case application with the ACC for water, wastewater, and recycled water rates, which proposed a collective revenue requirement increase of $4.6\u00a0million (relative to expected revenues in 2021, which is the final year of the rate phase-in from the last rate case) based on a 2019 test year. On August 2, 2021, we filed rejoinder testimony with the ACC updating our collective revenue increase to approximately $3.0\u00a0million. An evidentiary hearing was conducted beginning August 9, 2021. Certain of our utilities, including Santa Cruz and Palo Verde, have also requested that the rate increases be phased in over three years, beginning January 1, 2022. A final decision is not expected until the second quarter of 2022; therefore, any phase-in will not begin as requested on January 1, 2022 and may be shorter or longer than three years, if a revenue increase is approved.\nWe also requested the consolidation of water and/or wastewater rates for our Red Rock, Santa Cruz, Palo Verde, Picacho Water, and Picacho Utilities located in Pinal County. Of our utilities filing a rate case, these utilities make up approximately 96% of the Company's active service connections; provide or will provide water, wastewater, and recycled water services; and are expected to create economies of scale that are beneficial to all customers if consolidated.\nThere can be no assurance, however, that the ACC will approve the requested rate increase or any increase or the consolidation of water and wastewater rates described above, and the ACC could take other actions as a result of the rate case. Further, it is possible that the ACC may determine to decrease future rates. There can also be no assurance as to the timing of when an approved rate increase (if any) would go into effect.\nRevolving Credit Line \n-49-\nOn April 30, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with The Northern Trust Company, an Illinois banking corporation, for a two-year revolving line of credit up to $10.0 million with an initial maturity date of April 30, 2022. This credit facility, which may be used to refinance existing indebtedness, to acquire assets to use in and/or expand the Company\u2019s business, and for general corporate purposes, bears an interest rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 2.00% and has no unused line fee. This credit facility replaced the previous revolving line of credit with MidFirst Bank, which was terminated in April 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit line.\nOn April 30, 2021, the Company and The Northern Trust Company entered into an amendment to the loan agreement pursuant to which, among other things, the maturity date for the Company\u2019s revolving line of credit was extended to April 30, 2024.  \nRecent Events\nAcquisition of Rincon Water Company, Inc.\n \nOn January 20, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Rincon Water Company, Inc. (\"Rincon\"), an operator of a water utility with service area in Pima County, Arizona. The acquisition added an additional 73 connections and approximately 8.6 square miles of service area at the time of acquisition.\nAcquisition of Twin Hawks Utility, Inc\n \nOn January 13, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Twin Hawks Water Utility, Inc. (\"Twin Hawks\"), an operator of a water utility with service area in Pinal County, Arizona. The acquisition added an additional 18 connections and approximately 0.5 square miles of service area at the time of acquisition.\nAcquisition of Las Quintas Serenas Water Company\nOn November 3, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Las Quintas Serenas Water Company (\"Las Quintas\"), an operator of a water utility with service area in Pima County, Arizona. The acquisition added over 1,100 connections with approximately 2.5 square miles of service area.\nSale of Wireless Communication Tower\nOn April 9, 2021, the Company sold a wireless communication tower and related easement rights which resulted in a $1.5\u00a0million gain recorded as other income.\nSegment Reporting\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing operating performance. In consideration of the Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s Accounting Standards Codification 280, \nSegment Reporting\n, we are not organized around specific products and services, geographic regions, or regulatory environments. We currently operate in one geographic region within the State of Arizona, wherein each operating utility operates within the same regulatory environment.\nWhile we report revenue, disaggregated by service type, on the face of our statement of operations, we do not manage the business based on any performance measure at the individual revenue stream level. We do not have any customers that contribute more than 10% to our revenues or revenue streams. Additionally, the chief operating decision maker uses consolidated financial information to evaluate our performance, which is the same basis on which he communicates our results and performance to our board of directors. It is upon this consolidated basis from which he bases all significant decisions regarding the allocation of our resources on a consolidated level. Based on the information described above and in accordance with the applicable literature, management has concluded that we are currently organized and operated as one operating and reportable segment.\n-50-\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\n\u00a0\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\n\u00a0\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n\u00a0\n2021\n2020\nRevenues\n$\n41,914\u00a0\n$\n38,627\u00a0\nOperating expenses\n34,935\u00a0\n31,292\u00a0\nOperating income\n6,979\u00a0\n7,335\u00a0\nTotal other expense\n(2,220)\n(5,459)\nIncome before income taxes\n4,759\u00a0\n1,876\u00a0\nIncome tax expense\n(1,150)\n(771)\nNet income\n$\n3,609\u00a0\n$\n1,105\u00a0\nBasic earnings per common share\n$\n0.16\u00a0\n$\n0.05\u00a0\nDiluted earnings per common share\n$\n0.16\u00a0\n$\n0.05\u00a0\nRevenues \u2013 \nThe following table summarizes our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\n\u00a0\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n\u00a0\n2021\n2020\nWater services\n$\n18,944\u00a0\n$\n18,072\u00a0\nWastewater and recycled water services\n22,241\u00a0\n20,394\u00a0\nUnregulated revenues\n729\u00a0\n161\u00a0\nTotal revenues\n$\n41,914\u00a0\n$\n38,627\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTotal revenues increased $3.3 million, or 8.5%, to $41.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by increased rates and organic growth in connection. Also, the increase was attributable to the recognition of $0.7 million of ICFA revenue related to funds received during 2021 for an area where the Company had completed all obligations under the ICFA related agreement, including water and wastewater services. Refer to Note 2 \u2014 \"Regulatory Decision and Related Accounting and Policy Changes\" for additional information about our ICFAs. \nWater Services \n\u2013 Water services revenue increased $0.9 million, or 4.8%, to $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in water services revenue was primarily due to increased rates and organic growth.\nWater services revenue based on consumption decreased $0.2 million, or 1.9%, to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by the decrease in consumption resulting from higher precipitation for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, partially offset by an increase in residential, construction and commercial consumption due to new connections added during the year.\nActive water connections increased 12.4% to 28,594 as of December 31, 2021 from 25,449 as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to growth in new connections.\nWater consumption decreased 2.3% to 3.2 billion gallons for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 3.3 billion gallons for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in consumption was primarily related to a decrease in  consumption resulting from higher precipitation, partially offset by an increase in residential, construction and commercial consumption due to new connections added during the year.\nWater services revenue associated with the basic service charge, excluding miscellaneous charges, increased $0.8 million, or 8.8%, to $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in active water connections, combined with an increase in rates related to Rate Decision No. 74364.\n-51-\nWastewater and Recycled Water Services \n\u2013 Wastewater and recycled water services revenue increased $1.8 million, or 9.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in wastewater and recycled water services revenue was primarily driven by a $1.9 million increase in wastewater services revenue. The increase in wastewater services revenue was attributable to the increase in rates related to Rate Decision No. 74364, as well as the increase in active wastewater connections, which increased 7.8% to 25,288 as of December 31, 2021 from 23,450 as of December 31, 2020.\nRecycled water services revenue, which is based on the number of gallons delivered, decreased by less than $0.1 million or 3.8%, to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in recycled water services revenue was primarily driven higher precipitation partly offset by an increase in rates. The volume of recycled water delivered decreased 85 million gallons, or 11.1%, to 683 million gallons for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 768 million gallons for the year ended December 31, 2020. Recycled water rates increased 7.9% per Rate Decision No. 74364 compared to 2020.\nOperating Expenses \n\u2013 The following table summarizes our operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\n\u00a0\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n\u00a0\n2021\n2020\nOperations and maintenance\n$\n10,299\u00a0\n$\n9,539\u00a0\nGeneral and administrative\n15,146\u00a0\n12,722\u00a0\nDepreciation\n9,490\u00a0\n9,031\u00a0\nTotal operating expenses\n$\n34,935\u00a0\n$\n31,292\u00a0\nOperations and Maintenance \n\u2013 Operations and maintenance costs, consisting of personnel costs, production costs (primarily chemicals and purchased electrical power), maintenance costs, and property tax, increased $0.8 million, or 8.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. \nTotal personnel expenses increased $0.5 million, or 16.2%, to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in personnel expenses was primarily related to an increase in medical expenses, employee hiring costs and salary and wage increases.\nRepairs and maintenance expense increased $0.1 million, or 37.3%, to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to increased plant equipment maintenance costs.\nProperty tax expense increased $0.1 million, or 4.3%, to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Property taxes are calculated using a centrally valued property calculation, which derives property values based upon three-year historical average revenues, which have been increasing.  \nGeneral and Administrative \u2013 \nGeneral and administrative costs include the day-to-day expenses of office operations, personnel costs, legal and other professional fees, insurance, rent, and regulatory fees. These costs increased $2.4 million, or 19.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\nPersonnel related costs increased $0.7 million, or 13.3%, to $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily related to an increase in medical expenses, employee hiring costs and salary and wage increases for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDeferred compensation expense increased $0.5 million, or 26.9%, to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the year over year change in our stock price, which increased $2.69 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to an increase of $1.26 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Refer to \nNote 14 \u2014 \u201cDeferred Compensation Awards\u201d\n of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. \nDepreciation and amortization\n - Depreciation and amortization expense increased $0.5 million, or 5.1%, to $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by increased depreciation due to the increase in fixed assets, offset by a reduction in amortization of intangible assets.\n-52-\nOther Expense\n \u2013 Other expense totaled $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The improvement of $3.2 million in other expense was primarily attributable to the $1.5 million gain from the sale of a wireless communication tower and related easement rights, $1.2 million increase in Buckeye growth premiums, and a lower loss in 2021 compared to 2020 of $0.5 million on disposal of assets.\nIncome Tax Expense \u2013 \nIncome tax expense of $1.2 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in pre-tax net income for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nNet Income \u2013 \nOur net income totaled $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to net income of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $2.5 million increase was primarily attributable to organic growth, the $1.5 million gain on the sale of a wireless communications tower and related easement rights, $1.2 million increase in growth premiums, offset by a $0.5 million loss on disposal of assets for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOutstanding Share Data\nAs of March\u00a010, 2022, there were 22,649,242 shares of our common stock outstanding and stock based awards to acquire an additional 520,481 shares of our common stock outstanding.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur capital resources are provided by internally generated cash flows from operations as well as debt and equity financing. Additionally, our regulated utility subsidiaries receive advances and contributions from customers, home builders, and real estate developers to partially fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas. We use our capital resources to:\n\u2022\nfund operating costs;\n\u2022\nfund capital requirements, including construction expenditures;\n\u2022\npay dividends;\n\u2022\nfund acquisitions; \n\u2022\nmake debt and interest payments; and\n\u2022\ninvest in new and existing ventures.\nOur utility subsidiaries operate in rate-regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited. Such recovery will take place over an extended period of time because recovery through rate increases is subject to regulatory lag.\nAs of December 31, 2021, other than expenditures within the normal course of business, we have no notable near-term cash expenditures, other than the two principal payments for our Series B senior secured notes in the amount of $1.9 million due in each of June and December of 2022. While specific facts and circumstances could change, we believe that we have sufficient cash on hand, the ability to draw on our $10.0 million revolving credit line, and the ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our operating cash flow requirements and capital expenditure plan as well as remain in compliance with our debt covenants for at least the next twelve months. However, our near term cash flow may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to \u201cRisk Factors\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for additional risks we face due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn March 2014, we initiated a dividend program to declare and pay a monthly dividend. On November 30, 2021, we announced a monthly dividend increase from $0.02434 per share ($0.29208 per share annually) to $0.02458 per share ($0.29496 per share annually). Although we expect monthly dividends will be declared and paid for the foreseeable future, the declaration of any dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and is subject to legal requirements and debt service ratio covenant requirements (refer to \u201c\u2014Senior Secured Notes\" and \"\u2014Revolving Credit Line\").\n-53-\nCash from Operating Activities\nCash flows provided by operating activities are used for operating needs and to meet capital expenditure requirements. Our future cash flows from operating activities will be affected by economic utility regulation, infrastructure investment, growth in service connections, customer usage of water, compliance with environmental health and safety standards, production costs, weather, and seasonality.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, our net cash provided by operating activities totaled $20.4 million compared to $14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $5.8 million increase in cash from operating activities was primarily driven by the increase in net income of $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 over the year ended December 31, 2020 coupled with a $2.5 million increase in other non-current liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2021 over the year ended December 31, 2020.\nCash from Investing Activities\nOur net cash used in investing activities totaled $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $10.9 million change in cash used in investing activities was driven by the increases in capital expenditures of $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in capital expenditures is tied to our capital expenditure program which is causing us to spend more on capex compared to the prior year.\nWe continue to invest capital prudently in our existing, core service areas where we are able to deploy our Total Water Management model as this includes any required maintenance capital expenditures and the construction of new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities. Our projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors. In particular, we continue to monitor the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic. We may reduce capital expenditures in the future, but will, in any event, continue to invest in maintenance related capital expenditures and perform those projects that are necessary to continue providing services.\nCash from Financing Activities\nOur net cash used in financing activities totaled $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a $15.0 million change as compared to the $7.1 million in cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020. This change was primarily driven by the $11.5 million in net proceeds received from our public offering of stock in January 2020, coupled with an increase of $0.5 million in AIAC cash payments received from developers for their portion of the taxes due for conveyances (refer to \"\u2014Corporate Transactions\u2014ACC Tax Docket\" for more information) for the year ended December 31, 2020. Cash used in financing activities was slightly higher due to an an increase in dividends paid of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020\nSenior Secured Notes \nOn June 24, 2016, we issued two series of senior secured notes with a total principal balance of $115.0 million at a blended interest rate of 4.55%. Series A carries\n \na principal balance of $28.8 million and bears an interest rate of 4.38% over a twelve-year term, with the principal payment due on June 15, 2028. Series B carries a principal balance of $86.3 million and bears an interest rate of 4.58% over a 20-year term. Series B is interest only for the first five years, with $1.9 million principal payments paid semiannually thereafter beginning December 2021. The proceeds of the senior secured notes were primarily used to refinance our long-term tax exempt bonds, pursuant to an early redemption option at 103%, plus accrued interest, as a result of the initial public offering of our common stock in May 2016.\nThe senior secured notes require the Company to maintain a debt service coverage ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated debt service of at least 1.10 to 1.00. Consolidated debt service is calculated as interest expense, principal payments, and dividend or stock repurchases. The senior secured notes also contain a provision limiting the payment of dividends if the Company falls below a debt service ratio of 1.25. However, for the quarter ended June 30, 2021 through the quarter ending March 31, 2024, the ratio drops to 1.20. The debt service ratio increases to 1.25 for any fiscal quarter during the period from and after June 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with its financial debt covenants.\nDebt issuance costs as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $0.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively.\n-54-\nRevolving Credit Line \nOn April 30, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with The Northern Trust Company, an Illinois banking corporation (the \u201cNorthern Trust Loan Agreement\u201d), for a two-year revolving line of credit up to $10.0 million with a maturity date of April 30, 2022. This credit facility, which may be used to refinance existing indebtedness, to acquire assets to use in and/or expand the Company\u2019s business, and for general corporate purposes, bears an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.00% and has no unused line fee. This credit facility replaced the previous revolving line of credit with MidFirst Bank, which was terminated in April 2020. On April 30, 2021, the Northern Trust Loan Agreement was amended to, among other things, extend the maturity date from April 30, 2022 to April 30, 2024.\nSimilar to the senior secured notes, the Northern Trust Loan Agreement requires the Company to maintain a debt service coverage ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated debt service of at least 1.10 to 1.00. The Northern Trust Loan Agreement also contains a provision limiting the payment of dividends if the Company falls below a debt service ratio of 1.25. However, for the quarter ending June 30, 2021 through the quarter ending March 31, 2024, the ratio drops to 1.20. Additionally, the Northern Trust Loan Agreement contains certain restrictive covenants that limit, among other things, the Company\u2019s ability to: create liens and other encumbrances; incur additional indebtedness; merge, liquidate or consolidate with another entity; dispose of or transfer assets; make distributions or other restricted payments (including dividends); engage in certain affiliate transactions; and change the nature of the business. The foregoing covenants were subject to various qualifications and limitations as set forth in the Northern Trust Loan Agreement. Pursuant to the Northern Trust Loan Agreement, the revolving credit facility is subject to certain customary events of default after which the revolving credit facility could be declared due and payable if not cured within the grace period or, in certain circumstances, could be declared due and payable immediately. Refer to Note 11 \u2014 \"Debt\" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. As of December 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with its financial debt covenants. \nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under this credit line with The Northern Trust Company. The company incurred $95,000 and $73,000 in debt issuance costs relating to the Northern Trust Loan Agreement as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the course of normal business activities, the Company enters into a variety of contractual obligations and commitments. Some result in direct obligations on the Company's balance sheet while others are commitments, some firm and some based on uncertainties and undetermined execution times.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2021 (in thousands):\nPayments Due By Period\nTotal\nLess than 1 Year\n2 - 3 Years\n3 - 5 Years\nMore than 5 Years\nLong term debt obligations\n$\n113,084\u00a0\n$\n3,833\u00a0\n$\n7,667\u00a0\n$\n7,667\u00a0\n$\n93,917\u00a0\nInterest on long-term debt \n(1)\n$\n46,371\u00a0\n5,078\u00a0\n9,629\u00a0\n8,927\u00a0\n22,737\u00a0\nCapital lease obligation\n$\n341\u00a0\n142\u00a0\n165\u00a0\n34\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\nInterest on capital lease\n$\n22\u00a0\n12\u00a0\n10\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\nOperating lease obligation\n$\n1,432\u00a0\n268\u00a0\n570\u00a0\n428\u00a0\n166\u00a0\nTotal \n(2)\n$\n161,250\u00a0\n$\n9,333\u00a0\n$\n18,041\u00a0\n$\n17,056\u00a0\n$\n116,820\u00a0\n(1) Interest on the long-term debt is based on the fixed rates of the Company\u2019s senior secured notes. \n(2) In addition to these obligations, the Company pays annual refunds on AIAC over a specific period of time based on operating revenues generated from developer-installed infrastructure. The refund amounts are considered an investment in infrastructure and eligible for inclusion in future rate base. These refund amounts are not included in the above table because the refund amounts and timing are dependent upon several variables, including new customer connections, customer consumption levels, and future rate increases, which cannot be accurately estimated. Portions of these refund amounts are payable annually over the next two decades, and amounts not paid by the contract expiration dates become nonrefundable and are transferred to CIAC.\n-55-\nInsurance Coverage\nWe carry various property, casualty, and financial insurance policies with limits, deductibles, and exclusions consistent with industry standards. However, insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover unanticipated losses or claims. We are self-insured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on our short-term and long-term financial condition and the results of operations and cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Judgments, and Estimates\nThe application of critical accounting policies is particularly important to our financial condition and results of operations and provides a framework for management to make significant estimates, assumptions, and other judgments. Additionally, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow are impacted by the methods, assumptions, and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies. Although our management believes that these estimates, assumptions, and other judgments are appropriate, they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Accordingly, changes in the estimates, assumptions, and other judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements. \nAccounting for Rate Regulation\nBecause the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are regulated businesses, the Company is subject to the authoritative guidance for accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation.  Application of this guidance requires accounting for certain transactions in accordance with regulations adopted by the ACC. Utility companies defer costs and credits on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that those costs and credits will be recognized in the ratemaking process in a period different from the period in which they would have been reflected in income by an unregulated company. These deferred regulatory assets and liabilities are then reflected in the income statement in the period in which the same amounts are reflected in the rates charged for service.\nWhen our regulated subsidiaries file rate cases, their capital assets, operating costs and other matters are subject to review, and disallowances may occur, and the Company may be required to write-off related regulatory assets that are not specifically recoverable and determine if other assets might be impaired. See Note 2 to our Financial Statements for more information regarding our rate proceedings.  Management continually evaluates the anticipated recovery, settlement or refund of regulatory assets, liabilities, and revenues subject to refund and provides for allowances and/or reserves that it believes to be necessary. In the event that management\u2019s assessment as to the probability of the inclusion in the ratemaking process is incorrect, the associated regulatory asset or liability will be adjusted to reflect the change in assessment or the impact of regulatory approval of rates. \nIncome Taxes\nEstimation of income taxes includes an evaluation of the recoverability of deferred tax assets based on an assessment of the Company\u2019s ability to utilize the underlying future tax deductions against future taxable income before they expire. The Company\u2019s assessment is based upon existing tax laws and estimates of future taxable income. If the assessment of the Company\u2019s ability to utilize the underlying future tax deductions changes, the Company would be required to recognize fewer of the tax deductions as assets, which would increase the income tax expense in the period in which the determination is made. Additionally, an evaluation of the recoverability of deferred tax gains is based on an assessment of the Company's ability to fully utilize the deferred tax gain before it expires. The Company's assessment is based upon the ability to acquire qualifying properties. If the assessment of the Company's ability to fully utilize the deferred tax gain changes, the Company would be required to recognize income tax expense in the period in which the deferred tax gain expires. \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nA discussion of recently issued and recently issued but not yet adopted accounting pronouncements is included footnote 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\n-56-", "item7a": ">Item 7A.
