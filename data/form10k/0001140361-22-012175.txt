{"item1": ">Item 1.\n\n    \n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGENERAL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOld Point Financial Corporation (the Company) was incorporated under the laws of Virginia on February 16, 1984, for the purpose of acquiring all the outstanding common stock of The Old Point\n          National Bank of Phoebus (the Bank), in connection with the reorganization of the Bank into a one-bank holding company structure. At the annual meeting of the stockholders on March 27, 1984, the proposed reorganization was approved by the\n          requisite stockholder vote. At the effective date of the reorganization on October 1, 1984, the Bank merged into a newly formed national bank as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, with each outstanding share of common stock of the Bank\n          being converted into five shares of common stock of the Company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company completed a spin-off of its trust department as of April 1, 1999. The organization is chartered as Old Point Trust & Financial Services, N.A. (Trust). Trust is a nationally\n          chartered trust company. The purpose of the spin-off was to have a corporate structure more ready to compete in the field of wealth management. Trust is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bank is a national banking association that was founded in 1922. As of the end of 2021, the Bank had 16 branch offices\n. During the first quarter of 2022, the Bank\n          completed the planned closure of two branches, creating a 14 branch office network\n serving the Hampton Roads localities of Hampton, Newport News, Norfolk, Virginia Beach, Chesapeake, Williamsburg/James City\n            County, York County and Isle of Wight County. \nThe Bank offers a complete line of consumer, mortgage and business banking services, including loan, deposit, and cash management services to individual \nand\n\n\n            commercial customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s primary activity is as a holding company for the common stock of the Bank and Trust. The principal business of the Company is conducted through its subsidiaries, which continue to\n          conduct business in substantially the same manner as before the reorganization and spin-off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had assets of $1.3 billion, gross loans of $843.5 million, deposits of $1.2 billion, and stockholders' equity of $120.8 million.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman Capital Resources\n\n\nThe Company strives to foster a culture of respect, teamwork, ownership, responsibility, initiative, integrity, and service and believes our officers and employees are our most important\n          assets. Our people are critical to the Company\u2019s performance and the achievement of our strategic goals, and they represent a key element of how the Company\u2019s businesses compete and succeed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcquiring and retaining strong talent is a top strategic priority for the Company. We provide a competitive compensation and benefits program to help meet the needs of our employees, including\n          benefits that incentivize retention and reward longevity. We support the health and well-being of our employees through a comprehensive program designed to increase employee focus on wellness and prevention, including through the benefit plans\n          and health incentives offered. We encourage and support the growth and development of our employees and, wherever possible, seek to fill positions by promotion and transfer from within the Company. We have created development plans that are\n          designed to encourage an employee\u2019s advancement and growth within our organization, and we aim to provide employees with the skills and opportunities needed to achieve their goals and become leaders in our businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company employed 275, or 273 full-time equivalent, employees. We consider relations with our employees to be strong. We strive for our workforce to reflect the\n          diversity of the customers and communities we serve. Our selection and promotion processes are merit-based and include the active recruitment of minorities and women. At December 31, 2021, women represented 73% of our employees, and racial and\n          ethnic minorities represented 23% percent of our employees. We also aim for our employees to develop their careers in our businesses. At December 31, 2021, 24% percent of our employees have been employed by the Company for at least 15 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMARKET AREA AND COMPETITION\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s primary market area is located in Hampton Roads, situated in the southeastern corner of Virginia and boasting the world\u2019s largest natural deepwater harbor. The Hampton Roads\n          Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) is the 37th most populous MSA in the United States according to the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2020 census and the 3rd largest deposit market in Virginia, after Richmond and the Washington Metropolitan area,\n          according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Hampton Roads includes the cities of Chesapeake, Hampton, Newport News, Norfolk, Poquoson, Portsmouth, Suffolk, Virginia Beach and Williamsburg, and the counties of Isle of Wight,\n          Gloucester, James City, Mathews, York and Surry. The financial services industry remains highly competitive and is constantly evolving. The Company experiences strong competition from national, regional and other community financial institutions\n          and credit unions, as well as finance companies, mortgage companies, wealth management companies, insurance companies, and fintech companies. The market area is serviced by 46 banks, savings institutions and credit unions and, in addition,\n          branches of virtually every major brokerage house serve the Company\u2019s market area. The Company continues to build a stronger presence, expanding into additional markets in the last two years, which include a Mortgage team based in Charlotte,\n          North Carolina and a commercial loan production office based in Richmond, Virginia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe banking business in Virginia, and in the Company\u2019s primary service areas in the Hampton Roads MSA, is highly competitive and dominated by a relatively small number of large\n            banks with many offices operating over a wide geographic area. As a result, the Bank faces intense competition in all areas of its business. Among the advantages such large banks have over the Company is their ability to finance wide-ranging\n            advertising campaigns, and by virtue of their greater total capitalization, to have substantially higher lending limits than the Company. Factors such as interest rates offered, the number and location of branches and the types of products\n            offered, as well as the reputation of the institution affect competition for deposits and loans. The Company competes by emphasizing customer service and technology, establishing long-term customer relationships and building customer loyalty,\n            and providing products and services to address the specific needs of the Company\u2019s customers. The Company targets individual and small-to-medium size business customers. \nCompetition among providers of financial products and services\n          continues to increase as technology advances have lowered the barriers to entry for financial technology companies, with customers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives, and from a\n          growing selection of products and services at banking institutions that are based on new financial technology. The ability of non-banking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified\n          competition. Because nonbank financial institutions are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies, they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures. \u00a0\nThe Company also faces competitive pressure from large credit unions in the area. The three largest credit unions headquartered in the Hampton Roads MSA are Langley Federal Credit Union, Chartway Federal Credit Union, and BayPort Credit\n            Union.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrust faces intense competition in all aspects and areas of its business from both regulated and unregulated financial services organizations, including a broad range of financial institutions,\n          investment firms, benefits consultants, trust companies, insurance companies, investment counseling firms, and various financial technology companies. Because Trust focuses on managing client investment assets to generate fee income, Trust faces\n          significant competition from financial technologies that offer products and services that automate asset management or asset selection and, in turn, may charge lower asset management or administrative fees. Trust\u2019s non-bank competitors are not\n          subject to the same regulatory restrictions as Trust, and therefore may be able to operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures.\u00a0 Trust competes by emphasizing proactive, holistic solutions and top-tier client service, and focuses\n          on developing client relationships that serve as a source of recurring fee-based income.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company continues to build a strong presence in the business banking market, as well as expanding into other fee-based lines of business. In 2017, the Company purchased full ownership of\n          Old Point Mortgage, LLC and launched Old Point Insurance, LLC. Through these comprehensive business services and new lines of business, the Company is able to service a highly lucrative market that offers increased opportunities for new fee-based\n          revenue streams and to cross sell additional products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company maintains a website on the Internet at www.oldpoint.com. The Company makes available free of charge, on or through its website, its proxy statements, annual\n          reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n          This reference to the Company\u2019s Internet address shall not, under any circumstances, be deemed to incorporate the information available at such Internet address into this Form 10-K or other SEC filings. The information available at the Company\u2019s\n          Internet address is not part of this Form 10-K or any other report filed by the Company with the SEC. The Company's SEC filings can also be obtained on the SEC\u2019s website on the Internet at \nwww.sec.gov.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the first quarter of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant disruption in economic activity worldwide, including in market areas served by the Company.\n          The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is fluid and continues to evolve. The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated impacts on trade (including supply chains and export levels), travel, employee productivity, unemployment, consumer spending, and other\n          economic activities has resulted in less economic activity, lower equity market valuations and significant volatility and disruption in financial markets and has had an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of\n          operations due to net interest margin compression. The ultimate extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations is currently not yet estimable, and the Company believes that\n          it will depend on various developments and other factors, including, among others, the impacts of new COVID-19 variants, as well as changing governmental, regulatory and private sector responses to the pandemic, and the associated impacts on the\n          economy, financial markets and our customers, employees and vendors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimates for the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2021 include probable and estimable losses related to the COVID-19 pandemic. While there have been signals of\n          economic recovery and a resumption of many types of business activity, there remains significant uncertainty in the measurement of these losses due to the continuing effects of COVID-19 (including the impacts of new COVID-19 variants). If there\n          are further challenges to the economic recovery, then additional provision for loan losses may be required in future periods. It is unknown how long these conditions will last and what the ultimate financial impact will be to the Company.\n          Depending on the severity and duration of the economic consequences of the pandemic, the Company\u2019s goodwill may become impaired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted, which included provisions that, among other things, (i) established the PPP to provide loans guaranteed by the SBA to\n          businesses affected by the pandemic, (ii) provided certain forms of economic stimulus, including direct payments to certain U.S. households, enhanced unemployment benefits, certain income tax benefits intended to assist businesses in surviving\n          the economic crisis, and delayed the required implementation of certain new accounting standards for some entities, and (iii) provided limited regulatory relief to banking institutions. The federal banking agencies have eased certain bank capital\n          requirements and reporting requirements in response to the pandemic and have encouraged banking institutions to work prudently with borrowers affected by the pandemic by offering loan modifications that can improve borrowers\u2019 capacity to service\n          debt, increase the potential for financially stressed residential borrowers to keep their homes, and facilitate financial institutions\u2019 ability to collect on their loans. The Federal Reserve also established the PPPLF to provide funding to\n          eligible financial institutions to facilitate lending under the PPP. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, enacted on December 27, 2020, expanded on some of the benefits made available under the CARES Act, including the PPP program, and\n          provided further economic stimulus. On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan which provided a further $1.9 trillion of pandemic relief.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations generally rely upon the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans, the value of collateral\n          underlying secured loans, and the demand for loans and other products and services offered, which are highly dependent on the business environment in the Company\u2019s primary markets. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had no loan modifications\n          under the CARES Act, down from $7.4 million as of December 31, 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREGULATION AND SUPERVISION\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral.\n Bank holding companies, banks and their affiliates are extensively regulated under both federal and state law. The following\n          summary briefly describes significant provisions of currently applicable federal and state laws and certain regulations and the potential impact of such provisions. This summary is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the\n          particular statutory or regulatory provisions or proposals. Because regulation of financial institutions changes regularly and is the subject of constant legislative and regulatory debate, no assurance can be given as to forecast how federal and\n          state regulation and supervision of financial institutions may change in the future and affect the Company\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a public company, the Company is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), which include, but are not limited to,\n          the filing of annual, quarterly and other reports with the SEC. The Company is also required to comply with other laws and regulations of the SEC applicable to public companies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a national bank, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and regular examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the Comptroller). The prior approval of the\n          Comptroller or other appropriate bank regulatory authority is required for a national bank to merge with another bank or purchase the assets or assume the deposits of another bank. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and\n          acquisition transactions, the bank regulatory authorities will consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position of the constituent organizations and the combined organization, the\n          risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system, the applicant's performance record under the Community Reinvestment Act (the CRA) and fair housing initiatives, the data security and cybersecurity infrastructure of the constituent\n          organizations and the combined organization, and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities. Each depositor's account with the Bank is insured by the FDIC to the maximum amount permitted by law. The\n          Bank is also subject to certain regulations promulgated by the FRB and applicable provisions of Virginia law, insofar as they do not conflict with or are not preempted by federal banking law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a non-depository national banking association, Trust is subject to regulation, supervision and regular examination by the Comptroller. Trust's exercise of fiduciary powers must comply with\n          regulations promulgated by the Comptroller at 12 C.F.R. Part 9 and with Virginia law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe regulations of the FRB, the Comptroller and the FDIC govern most aspects of the Company's business, including deposit reserve requirements, investments, loans, certain check clearing\n          activities, issuance of securities, payment of dividends, branching, and numerous other matters.\u00a0 Further, the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines and released interpretive materials that establish operational and managerial\n          standards to promote the safe and sound operation of banks and bank holding companies.\u00a0 These standards relate to the institution's key operating functions, including but not limited to internal controls, internal audit systems, loan\n          documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation of management, information systems, data security and cybersecurity, and risk management.\u00a0 As a consequence of the extensive\n          regulation of commercial banking activities in the United States, the Company's business is particularly susceptible to changes in state and federal legislation and regulations, which may have the effect of increasing the cost of doing business,\n          limiting permissible activities or increasing competition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a bank holding company, the Company is subject to the BHCA and regulation and supervision by the FRB. A bank holding company is required to obtain the approval of the FRB before making\n          certain acquisitions or engaging in certain activities. Bank holding companies and their subsidiaries are also subject to restrictions on transactions with insiders and affiliates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA bank holding company is required to obtain the approval of the FRB before it may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, and before it may acquire ownership or control of\n          the voting shares of any bank if, after giving effect to the acquisition, the bank holding company would own or control more than 5 percent of the voting shares of such bank. The approval of the FRB is also required for the merger or\n          consolidation of bank holding companies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn July 9, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy, which, among other initiatives, encouraged the review of current practices and\n          adoption of a plan for the revitalization of merger oversight under the BHCA and the Bank Merger Act. Making any formal changes to the framework for evaluating bank mergers would require an extended process, and any such changes are uncertain and\n          cannot be predicted at this time. However, the adoption of more expansive or stringent standards may have an impact on the Company\u2019s acquisition activity. Additionally, this Executive Order could influence the federal bank regulatory agencies\u2019\n          expectations and supervisory oversight for banking acquisitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPursuant to the BHCA, the FRB has the power to order any bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the\n          FRB has reasonable grounds to believe that continuation of such activity or ownership constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company is required to file periodic reports with the FRB and provide any additional information the FRB may require. The FRB also has the authority to examine the Company and its\n          subsidiaries, as well as any arrangements between the Company and its subsidiaries, with the cost of any such examinations to be borne by the Company.\u00a0 Banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies are also subject to certain restrictions\n          imposed by federal law in dealings with their holding companies and other affiliates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulatory Reform.\n The financial crisis of 2008, including the downturn of global economic, financial and money markets and the\n          threat of collapse of numerous financial institutions, and other events led to the adoption of numerous laws and regulations that apply to, and focus on, financial institutions. The most significant of these laws is the Dodd-Frank Wall Street\n          Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), which was enacted on July 21, 2010 and, in part, was intended to implement significant structural reforms to the financial services industry.\u00a0 The Dodd-Frank Act implemented far-reaching\n          changes across the financial regulatory landscape, including changes that have significantly affected the business of all bank holding companies and banks, including the Company and the Bank. Some of the rules that have been proposed and, in some\n          cases, adopted to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s mandates are discussed further below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the EGRRCPA) was enacted to reduce the regulatory burden on certain banking organizations, including community\n          banks, by modifying or eliminating certain federal regulatory requirements. While the EGRRCPA maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository\n          institutions with assets of less than $10 billion as well as for larger banks with assets above $50 billion. In addition, the EGRRCPA included regulatory relief for community banks regarding regulatory examination cycles, call reports,\n          application of the Volcker Rule (proprietary trading prohibitions), mortgage disclosures, qualified mortgages, and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans. However, federal banking regulators retain broad discretion to\n          impose additional regulatory requirements on banking organizations based on safety and soundness and U.S. financial system stability considerations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company continues to experience ongoing regulatory reform. These regulatory changes could have a significant effect on how the Company conducts its business. The specific implications of\n          the Dodd-Frank Act, the EGRRCPA, and other potential regulatory reforms cannot yet be fully predicted and will depend to a large extent on the specific regulations that are to be adopted in the future. Certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act and\n          the EGRRCPA are discussed in more detail below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapital Requirements and Prompt Corrective Action. \nThe FRB, the Comptroller and the FDIC have adopted risk-based capital adequacy\n          guidelines for bank holding companies and banks pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) and the Basel III Capital Accords. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\n          of Operations \u2013 Capital Resources\" in Item 7 of this report on Form 10-K.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal banking agencies have broad powers to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems of insured depository institutions.\u00a0 Under the FDICIA, there are five\n          capital categories applicable to bank holding companies and insured institutions, each with specific regulatory consequences. The extent of the agencies' powers depends on whether the institution in question is \"well capitalized,\" \"adequately\n          capitalized,\" \"undercapitalized,\" \"significantly undercapitalized\" or \"critically undercapitalized.\"\u00a0 These terms are defined under uniform regulations issued by each of the federal banking agencies.\u00a0 If the appropriate federal banking agency\n          determines that an insured institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition, it may reclassify the institution to a lower capital category (other than critically undercapitalized) and require the submission of a plan to correct the unsafe or\n          unsound condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFailure to meet statutorily mandated capital guidelines or more restrictive ratios separately established for a financial institution could subject the Company and its subsidiaries to a variety\n          of enforcement remedies, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on accepting or renewing brokered deposits, limitations on the rates of interest that the institution may pay on\n          its deposits, and other restrictions on its business.\u00a0 In addition, an institution may not make a capital distribution, such as a dividend or other distribution that is in substance a distribution of capital to the owners of the institution if\n          following such a distribution the institution would be undercapitalized. Thus, if the making of such dividend would cause the Bank to become undercapitalized, it could not pay a dividend to the Company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasel III Capital Framework. \nThe federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted rules to implement the Basel III capital framework as\n          outlined by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and standards for calculating risk-weighted assets and risk-based capital measurements (collectively, the Basel III Capital Rules).\u00a0 For purposes of these capital rules, (i) common equity\n          Tier 1 capital (CET1) consists principally of common stock (including surplus) and retained earnings; (ii) Tier 1 capital consists principally of CET1 plus non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, and certain grandfathered cumulative\n          preferred stock and trust preferred securities; and (iii) Tier 2 capital consists of other capital instruments, principally qualifying subordinated debt and preferred stock, and limited amounts of an institution's allowance for loan losses.\u00a0 Each\n          regulatory capital classification is subject to certain adjustments and limitations, as implemented by the Basel III Capital Rules.\u00a0 The Basel III Capital Rules also establish risk weightings that are applied to many classes of assets held by\n          community banks, including, importantly, applying higher risk weightings to certain commercial real estate loans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Basel III Capital Rules and minimum capital ratios required to be maintained by banks were effective on January 1, 2015. The Basel III Capital Rules also include a requirement that banks\n          maintain additional capital, or a capital conservation buffer (as described below) which was phased in beginning January 1, 2016 and became fully phased in as of January 1, 2019.\u00a0 As fully phased in, the Basel III Capital Rules require banks to\n          maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% \"capital conservation buffer\" (which is added to the 4.5% CET1 ratio, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least\n          7%), (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%), (iii) a\n          minimum ratio of total (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of\n          10.5%) and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total assets, subject to certain adjustments and limitations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Basel III Capital Rules provide deductions from and adjustments to regulatory capital measures, and primarily to CET1, including deductions and adjustments that were not applied to reduce\n          CET1 under historical regulatory capital rules.\u00a0 For example, mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities must be deducted from CET1 to the\n          extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCommunity Bank Leverage Ratio.\n\u00a0\nAs required by the EGRRCPA, the federal banking agencies have\n          implemented the Community Bank Leverage Ratio Framework (the CBLRF), which is based on the ratio of a bank\u2019s tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets. To qualify for the CBLRF, a bank must have less than $10 billion in total\n          consolidated assets, limited amounts of off-balance sheet exposures and trading assets and liabilities, and a leverage ratio greater than 9%. A bank that elects the CBLRF and has a leverage ratio greater than 9% will be considered to be in\n          compliance with Basel III capital requirements and exempt from the complex Basel III calculations and will also be deemed \u201cwell capitalized\u201d under Prompt Corrective Action regulations, discussed below. A bank that falls out of compliance with the\n          CBLRF will have a two-quarter grace period to come back into full compliance, provided its leverage ratio remains above 8% (a bank will be deemed \u201cwell capitalized\u201d during the grace period). The CBLRF became available beginning March 31, 2020,\n          with the flexibility for banking organizations to subsequently opt into or out of the CBLRF, as applicable. The federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule in April 2020 to implement certain provisions of the CARES Act that temporarily\n          modified the minimum leverage ratio requirements of the CBLRF. The minimum leverage ratio requirement was reduced from 9% to 8% for the second through fourth quarters of 2020 and 8.5% through 2021. A bank that falls out of compliance with the\n          CBLRF will have a two-quarter grace period to come back into full compliance, provided its leverage ratio remains no more than 100 basis points below the applicable minimum leverage ratio requirement. The Bank has not elected to opt into the\n          CBLRF.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall Bank Holding Company.\n\u00a0\nThe EGRRCPA also expanded the category of bank holding companies\n          that may rely on the FRB\u2019s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement by raising the maximum amount of assets a qualifying bank holding company may have from $1 billion to $3 billion. In addition to meeting the asset threshold, a bank holding\n          company must not engage in significant nonbanking activities, not conduct significant off-balance sheet activities, and not have a material amount of debt or equity securities outstanding and registered with the SEC (subject to certain\n          exceptions). The FRB may, in its discretion, exclude any bank holding company from the application of the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement if such action is warranted for supervisory purposes.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nIn August 2018, the FRB issued an interim final rule to apply the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement to bank holding companies with consolidated total assets of less than $3 billion.\n          The policy statement, which, among other things, exempts certain bank holding companies from minimum consolidated regulatory capital ratios that apply to other bank holding companies. As a result of the interim final rule, which was effective\n          August 30, 2018, the Company expects that it will be treated as a small bank holding company and will not be subject to regulatory capital requirements. The comment period on the interim final rule closed on October 29, 2018 and, to date, the FRB\n          has not issued a final rule to replace the interim final rule. The Bank remains subject to the regulatory capital requirements described above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsurance of Accounts, Assessments and Regulation by the FDIC\n.\n\u00a0 The Bank\u2019s deposits are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) of the FDIC up to the standard maximum insurance amount for each deposit insurance ownership category. The basic limit on FDIC deposit insurance\n            coverage is $250,000 per depositor. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition\n            to continue operations as an insured institution, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC, subject to administrative and potential judicial hearing and review processes.\n\u00a0\nThe FDIC may also suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance if the institution has no tangible capital. If deposit insurance is terminated, the\n            deposits at the institution at the time of termination, less subsequent withdrawals, shall continue to be insured for a period from six months to two years, as determined by the FDIC. Management is aware of no existing circumstances that could\n            result in termination of the Bank\u2019s deposit insurance.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDeposit Insurance Assessments.\n\u00a0 The DIF is funded by assessments on banks and other depository institutions calculated based on\n          average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity (defined as Tier 1 capital). As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has adopted a large-bank pricing assessment scheme, set a target \u201cdesignated reserve ratio\u201d (described in more\n          detail below) of 2% for the DIF and, in lieu of dividends, provides for a lower assessment rate schedule when the reserve ratio reaches 2% and 2.5%. An institution's assessment rate is based on a statistical analysis of financial ratios that\n          estimates the likelihood of failure over a three-year period, which considers the institution\u2019s weighted average CAMELS component rating, and is subject to further adjustments including those related to levels of unsecured debt and brokered\n          deposits (not applicable to banks with less than $10 billion in assets). At December 31, 2021, total base assessment rates for institutions that have been insured for at least five years range from 1.5 to 30 basis points applying to banks with\n          less than $10 billion in assets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0The Dodd-Frank Act transferred to the FDIC increased discretion with regard to managing the required amount of reserves for the DIF, or the \u201cdesignated reserve ratio.\u201d The FDIA requires that\n          the FDIC consider the appropriate level for the designated reserve ratio on at least an annual basis. As of December 31, 2021, the designated reserve ratio was 2.00% and the minimum designated reserve ratio was 1.35%. Although the DIF declined\n          below the minimum level of 1.35% during 2020 due to the impact of significant deposit increases which led the FDIC to adopt a DIF restoration plan, and the DIF was 1.27% at December 30, 2021, the FDIC has not increased base assessment rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn June 2020, the FDIC adopted a final rule that generally removes the effect of PPP lending when calculating a bank\u2019s deposit insurance assessment by providing an offset to the bank\u2019s total assessment amount for\n          the increase in the assessment base attributable to the bank\u2019s participation in the PPP. This final rule began applying to FDIC deposit insurance assessments during the second quarter of 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncentive Compensation. \nThe FRB, the Comptroller and the FDIC have issued regulatory guidance intended to ensure that the incentive\n          compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The FRB will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive\n          compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not \"large, complex banking organizations.\" The findings will be included in reports of examination, and deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization's\n          supervisory ratings. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization's safety and soundness\n          and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, in 2016, the SEC and the federal banking agencies proposed rules that prohibit covered financial institutions (including bank holding companies and banks) from establishing or\n          maintaining incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by providing covered persons (consisting of senior executive officers and significant risk takers, as defined in the rules) with excessive\n          compensation, fees or benefits that could lead to material financial loss to the financial institution.\u00a0 The proposed rules outline factors to be considered when analyzing whether compensation is excessive and whether an incentive-based\n          compensation arrangement encourages inappropriate risks that could lead to material loss to the covered financial institution, and establishes minimum requirements that incentive-based compensation arrangements must meet to be considered to not\n          encourage inappropriate risks and to appropriately balance risk and reward.\u00a0 The proposed rules also impose additional corporate governance requirements on the boards of directors of covered financial institutions and impose additional\n          record-keeping requirements.\u00a0 The comment period for these proposed rules has closed and a final rule has not yet been published. However, in 2021, the SEC signaled a renewed interest in these matters by re-opening the comment period on a\n          proposed rule regarding clawbacks of incentive-based executive compensation, which was originally proposed in 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta\n.\n The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB)\n          of Atlanta, which is one of 12 regional FHLBs that provide funding to their members for making housing loans as well as for affordable housing and community development loans. Each FHLB serves as a reserve, or central bank, for the members within\n          its assigned region. Each FHLB makes loans to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB. As a member, the Bank must purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB. Additional information related\n          to the Bank\u2019s FHLB stock can be found in Note 16, Fair Value Measurements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this report on Form 10-K.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunity Reinvestment Act. \nThe Company is subject to the requirements of the CRA, which imposes on financial institutions an\n          affirmative and ongoing obligation to meet the credit needs of their local communities, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions. A financial institution's efforts in\n          meeting community credit needs are currently assessed based on specified factors.\u00a0 These factors also are considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility. At its last evaluation in 2020, the Bank\n          received an \u201cOutstanding\u201d CRA rating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfidentiality and Required Disclosures of Consumer Information. \nThe Company is subject to various laws and regulations that\n          address the privacy of nonpublic personal financial information of consumers. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain regulations issued thereunder protect against the transfer and use by financial institutions of consumer nonpublic personal\n          information. A financial institution must provide to its customers, at the beginning of the customer relationship and annually thereafter, the institution's policies and procedures regarding the handling of customers' nonpublic personal financial\n          information. These privacy provisions generally prohibit a financial institution from providing a customer's personal financial information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution discloses to the customer that the information may be\n          so provided and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn August 2018, the CFPB published its final rule to update Regulation P pursuant to the amended Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Under this rule, certain qualifying financial institutions are not\n          required to provide annual privacy notices to customers. To qualify, a financial institution must not share nonpublic personal information about customers except as described in certain statutory exceptions which do not trigger a customer\u2019s\n          statutory opt-out right. In addition, the financial institution must not have changed its disclosure policies and practices from those disclosed in its most recent privacy notice. The rule sets forth timing requirements for delivery of annual\n          privacy notices in the event that a financial institution that qualified for the annual notice exemption later changes its policies or practices in such a way that it no longer qualifies for the exemption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData privacy and data protection are areas of increasing state legislative focus.\u00a0 In March 2021, the Governor of Virginia signed into law the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (the VCDPA),\n          which goes into effect January 1, 2023.\u00a0 The VCDPA grants Virginia residents the right to access, correct, delete, know, and opt-out of the sale and processing for targeted advertising purposes of their personal information, similar to the\n          protections provided by similar consumer data privacy laws in California and in Europe.\u00a0 The VCDPA also imposes data protection assessment requirements and authorizes the Attorney General of Virginia to enforce the VCDPA, but does not provide a\n          private right of action for consumers.\u00a0 The Company and the Bank cannot yet predict how the implementation of the VCDPA will impact the Bank\u2019s products, services or other business activities. The Company continues to monitor legislative,\n          regulatory and supervisory developments related thereto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company is also subject to various laws and regulations that attempt to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The Bank Secrecy Act requires all financial institutions to, among\n          other things, create a system of controls designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and imposes recordkeeping and reporting requirements. The USA Patriot Act facilitates information sharing among governmental entities\n          and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering, and requires financial institutions to establish anti-money laundering programs. Regulations adopted under the Bank Secrecy Act impose on financial\n          institutions customer due diligence requirements, and the federal banking regulators expect that customer due diligence programs will be integrated within a financial institution\u2019s broader Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering compliance\n          program. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which is a division of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, is responsible for helping to ensure that United States entities do not engage in transactions with \"enemies\" of the United States,\n          as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. If the Bank finds a name of an \"enemy\" of the United States on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, it must freeze such account or place transferred funds\n          into a blocked account, file a suspicious activity report with the Treasury and notify the FBI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough these laws and programs impose compliance costs and create privacy obligations and, in some cases, reporting obligations, and compliance with all of the laws, programs, and privacy and\n          reporting obligations may require significant resources of the Company and the Bank, these laws and programs do not materially affect the Bank\u2019s products, services or other business activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Transparency Act\n.\n On January 1, 2021, as part of the 2021 National Defense\n          Authorization Act, Congress enacted the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA), which requires The U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to issue regulations implementing reporting requirements for \u201creporting\n          companies\u201d (as defined in the CTA) to disclose beneficial ownership interests of certain U.S. and foreign entities by January 1, 2022. The CTA imposes additional reporting requirements on entities not previously subject to such beneficial\n          ownership disclosure regulations and also contains exemptions for several different types of entities, including among others: (i) certain banks, bank holding companies, and credit unions; (ii) money transmitting businesses registered with\n          FinCEN; and (iii) certain insurance companies. Reporting companies subject to the CTA will be required to provide specific information with respect to beneficial owner(s) (as defined in the CTA) as well as satisfy initial filing obligations (for\n          newly-formed reporting companies) and submit on-going periodic reports. Non-compliance with FinCEN regulations promulgated under the CTA may result in civil fines as well as criminal penalties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn December 2021, FinCEN proposed the first of three sets of rules that it will issue to implement the beneficial ownership reporting requirements of the CTA, with subsequent rulemakings\n          expected (i) to implement the CTA\u2019s protocols for access to and disclosure of beneficial ownership information, and (ii) to revise the existing customer due diligence requirements that apply to the Company, the Bank, Trust, and many other\n          financial institutions, to ensure consistency between these requirements and the beneficial ownership reporting rules. The Company is unable to determine the ultimate impact of the CTA and related regulations on the Company and its subsidiaries.\n          The Company will continue to monitor regulatory developments related to the CTA, including future FinCEN rulemakings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCybersecurity\n.\n The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines for establishing\n          information security standards and cybersecurity programs for implementing safeguards under the supervision of a financial institution\u2019s board of directors. These guidelines, along with related regulatory materials, increasingly focus on risk\n          management and processes related to information technology and the use of third parties in the provision of financial products and services. The federal banking agencies expect financial institutions to establish lines of defense and ensure that\n          their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, and also expect financial institutions to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure rapid recovery, resumption and\n          maintenance of the institution\u2019s operations after a cyber-attack. If the Company, the Bank or Trust fails to meet the expectations set forth in this regulatory guidance, the Company, the Bank or Trust could be subject to various regulatory\n          actions and any remediation efforts may require significant resources. In addition, all federal and state bank regulatory agencies continue to increase focus on cybersecurity programs and risks as part of regular supervisory exams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn October 2016, the federal banking agencies issued proposed rules on enhanced cybersecurity risk-management and resilience standards that would apply to very large financial institutions and\n          to services provided by third parties to these institutions. The comment period for these proposed rules has closed and a final rule has not been published. Although the proposed rules would apply only to bank holding companies and banks with $50\n          billion or more in total consolidated assets, these rules could influence the federal banking agencies\u2019 expectations and supervisory requirements for information security standards and cybersecurity programs of smaller financial institutions,\n          such as the Company, the Bank and Trust.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn November 18, 2021, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule to improve the sharing of information about cyber incidents that may affect the U.S. banking system. The rule\n          requires a banking organization to notify its primary federal regulator of any significant computer-security incident as soon as possible and no later than 36 hours after the banking organization determines that a cyber incident has occurred.\n          Notification is required for incidents that have materially affected\u2014or are reasonably likely to materially affect\u2014the viability of a banking organization\u2019s operations, its ability to deliver banking products and services, or the stability of the\n          financial sector. In addition, the rule requires a bank service provider to notify affected banking organization customers as soon as possible when the provider determines that it has experienced a computer-security incident that has materially\n          affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect banking organization customers for four or more hours. Compliance with the final rule is required by May 1, 2022. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this rule, but does not\n          anticipate any material impact to operations at this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsumer Laws and Regulations. \nThe Company is also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect\n          consumers in transactions with banks. While the list set forth herein is not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act,\n          the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Fair Housing Act, among others. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions transact business with customers. The Company must\n          comply with the applicable provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of its ongoing customer relations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CFPB is the federal regulatory agency responsible for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws for institutions with more than $10 billion of\n          assets and, to a lesser extent, smaller institutions. The CFPB supervises and regulates providers of consumer financial products and services and has rulemaking authority in connection with numerous federal consumer financial protection laws (for\n          example, but not limited to, the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act).\u00a0 As a smaller institution (i.e., with assets of $10 billion or less), most consumer protection aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act will continue to be\n          applied to the Company by the FRB and to the Bank and Trust by the Comptroller. However, the CFPB may include its own examiners in regulatory examinations by a smaller institution's prudential regulators and may require smaller institutions to\n          comply with certain CFPB reporting requirements. In addition, regulatory positions taken by the CFPB and administrative and legal precedents established by CFPB enforcement activities, including in connection with supervision of larger bank\n          holding companies and banks, could influence how the FRB and Comptroller apply consumer protection laws and regulations to financial institutions that are not directly supervised by the CFPB. The precise effect of the CFPB's consumer protection\n          activities on the Company cannot be forecast. As of January 1, 2021, the Company and the Bank are not subject to the direct supervision of the CFPB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMortgage Banking Regulation\n.\u00a0 In connection with making mortgage loans, the Bank is subject to rules and regulations that, among\n          other things, establish standards for loan origination, prohibit discrimination, provide for inspections and appraisals of property, require credit reports on prospective borrowers, in some cases, restrict certain loan features and fix maximum\n          interest rates and fees, require the disclosure of certain basic information to mortgagors concerning credit and settlement costs, limit payment for settlement services to the reasonable value of the services rendered and require the maintenance\n          and disclosure of information regarding the disposition of mortgage applications based on race, gender, geographical distribution and income level. The Bank's mortgage origination activities are subject to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth\n          in Lending Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and Home Ownership Equity Protection Act, and the regulations promulgated under these acts, among other additional state and federal laws, regulations and rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bank's mortgage origination activities are also subject to Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act. Certain provisions of Regulation Z require mortgage lenders to make a\n          reasonable and good faith determination, based on verified and documented information, that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms. Alternatively, mortgage lender\u00a0 can\u00a0 originate\u00a0\n          \"qualified mortgages\", which are generally defined as mortgage loans without negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, terms exceeding 30 years, and points and fees paid by a consumer equal to or less than 3% of the total\n          loan amount. Under the EGRRCPA, most residential mortgages loans originated and held in portfolio by a bank with less than $10 billion in assets will be designated as \u201cqualified mortgages.\u201d Higher-priced qualified mortgages (e.g., subprime loans)\n          receive a rebuttable presumption of compliance with ability-to-repay rules, and other qualified mortgages (e.g., prime loans) are deemed to comply with the ability-to-repay rules. The Bank originates first mortgage loans that comply with\n          Regulation Z's \"qualified mortgage\" rules. The Bank also originates second mortgages, or equity loans, and these loans do not conform to the qualified mortgage criteria but comply with applicable ability-to-repay rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolcker Rule.\n The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks from engaging in proprietary trading\n          except in limited circumstances, and places limits on ownership of equity investments in private equity and hedge funds (the Volcker Rule). The EGRRCPA, and final rules adopted to implement the EGRRCPA, exempt all banks with less than $10 billion\n          in assets (including their holding companies and affiliates) from the Volcker Rule, provided that\n\u00a0\nthe institution has total trading assets and liabilities of five% or less of total assets, subject to\n          certain limited exceptions. The Company believes that its financial condition and its operations are not and will not be significantly affected by the Volcker Rule, amendments thereto, or its implementing regulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall Reports and Examination Cycle\n.\n All institutions, regardless of size, submit a quarterly\n          call report that includes data used by federal banking agencies to monitor the condition, performance, and risk profile of individual institutions and the industry as a whole. The EGRRCPA contained provisions expanding the number of regulated\n          institutions eligible to use streamlined call report forms. In June 2019, consistent with the provisions of the EGRRCPA, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule to permit insured depository institutions with total assets of less than $5\n          billion that do not engage in certain complex or international activities to file the most streamlined version of the quarterly call report, and to reduce data reportable on certain streamlined call report submissions.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nIn December 2018, consistent with the provisions of the EGRRCPA, the federal banking agencies jointly adopted final rules that permit banks with up to $3 billion in total assets, that received\n          a composite CAMELS rating of \u201c1\u201d or \u201c2,\u201d and that meet certain other criteria (including not having undergone any change in control during the previous 12-month period, and not being subject to a formal enforcement proceeding or order), to\n          qualify for an 18-month on-site examination cycle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 Related Regulatory Relief.\n\u00a0\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, federal banking\n          agencies issued a joint statement on March 22, 2020 encouraging banking institutions to work with borrowers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including offering short-term loan modifications to borrowers unable to meet their contractual payment\n          obligations. Under this interagency guidance, certain loans that have been modified are exempt from being reported as past due or as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). Further, the CARES Act, as later amended as discussed below, provided\n          additional exemptions from TDR reporting for certain loans that were modified for reasons related to the COVID-19 pandemic prior to January 1, 2022. As of December 31, 2021, the Bank had no loans under modification that were exempt from being\n          reported as TDRs under the CARES Act. Regulatory agencies also issued an interim final rule on April 7, 2020 which provides relief in bank regulatory capital requirements that allow loans originated under the PPP to be excluded from risk-weighted\n          assets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCongress also enacted the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, on December 27, 2020, which included (i) the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Non-profits, and Venues Act, (ii) the\n          COVID-Related Tax Relief Act of 2020, and (iii) the Taxpayer Certainty and Disability Relief Act of 2020. These laws include significant clarifications and modifications to PPP, which had terminated on August 8, 2020, and an extension of\n          provisions under the CARES Act related to loan modifications. In particular, Congress revived the PPP and allocated an additional $284.45 billion in PPP funds for 2021. The Bank participated in lending under the PPP and had $19.0 million of\n          outstanding PPP loans as of December 31, 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect of Governmental Monetary Policies.\n\n\nAs with other financial institutions, the earnings of the Company and the Bank are affected by general economic conditions as well as by the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board. Such\n          policies, which include regulating the national supply of bank reserves and bank credit, can have a major effect upon the source and cost of funds and the rates of return earned on loans and investments. The Federal Reserve Board exerts a\n          substantial influence on interest rates and credit conditions, primarily through establishing target rates for federal funds, open market operations in U.S. Government securities, varying the discount rate on member bank borrowings and setting\n          cash reserve requirements against deposits. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits, and rates received on loans and\n          investment securities and paid on deposits. Fluctuations in the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s monetary policies have had a significant impact on the operating results of the Corporation and the Bank and are expected to continue to do so in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC) decreased the federal funds target rate \u2013 i.e., the interest rate at which depository\n          institutions such as the Bank lend reserve balances to other depository institutions overnight on an uncollateralized basis \u2013 to a rate of zero to 0.25%. During the first quarter of 2022, the FOMC raised the federal funds target rate by 0.25% and\n          multiple members of the FOMC have signaled an intent to increase further the federal funds target rate during 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture Regulation\n. From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state\n          legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution\n          regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or\n          expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. The Company cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the\n          effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company or the Bank (or Trust) could have a\n          material effect on our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "item1a": ">Item 1A.\n                \n\n    \n\n\n\u00a0Risk Factors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the other information contained in this report, including the information contained in \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d investors in the Company\u2019s\n          securities should carefully consider the factors discussed below. An investment in the Company\u2019s securities involves risks. The factors below, among others, could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition,\n          results of operations, liquidity or capital position, or cause the Company\u2019s results to differ materially from its historical results or the results expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements contained in this report, in which case\n          the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline. The risk factors discussed below highlight the risks that the Company believes are material to the Company, but do not necessarily include all risk that an investor may face, and\n          investors should not interpret the disclosure of a risk to state or imply that the risk has not already materialized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Factors Related to our Lending Activities and Economic Conditions\n\n\nU.S. and international economic conditions and credit markets pose challenges for the Company and could adversely affect the results of\n            operations, liquidity and financial condition.\n In recent years, economic growth and business activity in the Company's local markets as well as in the broader national and international economies, has been modest. In addition, domestic\n          and foreign policies and the level of U.S. debt may present challenges to businesses and have a destabilizing effect on financial markets. Unfavorable or uncertain economic conditions generally could cause a decline in the value of the Company's\n          securities portfolio and could increase the regulatory scrutiny of financial institutions. Another deterioration of local economic conditions could again lead to declines in real estate values and home sales and increases in the financial stress\n          on borrowers and unemployment rates, all of which could lead to increases in loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures and reductions in loan collateral value. Such a deterioration of local economic conditions could cause the level of\n          loan losses to exceed the level the Company has provided in its allowance for loan losses which, in turn, would reduce the Company's earnings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal credit market conditions could return to being disrupted and volatile. Although the Company remains well capitalized and has not suffered any liquidity issues, the cost and availability\n          of funds may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets. Any future turbulence in the U.S. and international markets and economy may adversely affect the Company's liquidity, financial condition and profitability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeaknesses in the commercial real estate markets could negatively affect the Company's financial performance due to the Company's\n            concentration in commercial real estate loans. \nAt December 31, 2021, the Company had $460.1 million, or 54.5%, of total loans concentrated in commercial real estate, which includes, for purposes of this concentration, all construction\n          loans, loans secured by multifamily residential properties, loans secured by farmland and loans secured by nonfarm, nonresidential properties. Commercial real estate loans expose the Company to a greater risk of loss than residential real estate\n          and consumer loans. Commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential real estate and consumer loans. Consequently, an adverse development with respect\n          to one commercial real estate loan or credit relationship exposes the Company to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to one residential real estate loan. Commercial real estate loans carry risks\n          associated with the successful operation of a business if the properties are owner occupied. If the properties are non-owner occupied, the repayment of these loans may be dependent upon the profitability and cash flow from rent receipts.\n          Repayment of commercial real estate loans may, to a greater extent than residential real estate loans, be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or economy. Weak economic or market conditions may impair a borrower's business\n          operations, slow the execution of new leases and lead to turnover in existing leases. The combination of these factors could result in deterioration in value of some of the Company's loans. The deterioration of one or more of the Company's\n          significant commercial real estate loans could cause a significant increase in nonaccrual loans. An increase in nonaccrual loans could result in a loss of interest income from those loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses, and an\n          increase in loan charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company's profitability depends significantly on local economic conditions and changes in the federal government's military or defense\n            spending may negatively affect the local economy. \nThe Company's success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the markets in which the Company operates. Unlike larger financial institutions that are more geographically\n          diversified, the Company provides banking and financial services to customers primarily in the Hampton Roads MSA. The local economic conditions in this area have a significant impact on the demand for loans, the ability of the borrowers to repay\n          these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. A significant decline in general economic conditions, caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, an outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic calamities,\n          unemployment or other factors beyond the Company's control could impact these local economic conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, Hampton Roads is home to one of the largest military installations in the world and one of the largest concentrations of Department of Defense personnel in the United States. Some\n          of the Company's customers may be particularly sensitive to the level of federal government spending on the military or on defense-related products. Federal spending is affected by numerous factors, including macroeconomic conditions,\n          presidential administration priorities, and the ability of the federal government to enact relevant appropriations bills and other legislation. Any of these factors could result in future cuts to military or defense spending or increased\n          uncertainty about federal spending, which could have a severe negative impact on individuals and businesses in the Company's primary service area. Any related increase in unemployment rates or reduction in business development activities in the\n          Company's primary service area could lead to reductions in loan demand, increases in loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures and reductions in loan collateral value, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's\n          operating results and financial condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoans that the Bank has made through federal programs are dependent on the federal government\u2019s continuation and support of these programs\n              and on the Bank\u2019s compliance with program requirements. \nThe Bank participates in various U.S. government agency loan guarantee programs, including programs operated by the SBA. If the Bank fails to follow any applicable regulations,\n            guidelines or policies associated with a particular guarantee program, any loans the Bank originates as part of that program may lose the associated guarantee, exposing the Bank to credit risk it would not otherwise be exposed to or have\n            underwritten, or result in the Bank\u2019s inability to continue originating loans under such programs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFederal and state governments enacted laws and implemented programs intending to stimulate the economy in light of the business and market disruptions that were related to COVID-19, including\n            the PPP. The Bank participated as a lender in both rounds of the PPP. The PPP loans are fully guaranteed as to payment of principal and interest by the SBA and the Bank believes that the significant majority of these loans have been or will be\n            forgiven. However, there can be no assurance that the borrowers will use or have used the funds appropriately or will have satisfied the staffing or payment requirements to qualify for forgiveness in whole or in part. Any portion of the loan\n            that is not forgiven must be repaid by the borrower. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded or serviced\n            by the Bank, which may or may not be related to an ambiguity in the laws, rules or guidance regarding operation of the PPP, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if the Bank has already been\n            paid under the guaranty, seek recovery from the Bank of any loss related to the deficiency.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company is subject to losses resulting from fraudulent and negligent acts on the part of loan applicants, correspondents or other third\n            parties.\n The Company relies heavily upon information supplied by third parties, including the information contained in credit applications, employment and income documentation, property appraisals, title information, and equipment\n          pricing and valuation, in deciding which loans to originate, as well as in establishing the terms of those loans. If any of the information upon which the Company relies during the loan approval process is misrepresented, either fraudulently or\n          inadvertently, and the misrepresentation is not detected prior to asset funding, the value of the asset may be significantly lower than expected, the Company may fund a loan that it would not have otherwise funded or the Company may fund a loan\n          on terms that it would not have otherwise extended. Whether a misrepresentation is made by the applicant or by another third party, the Company generally bears the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. In addition, a loan subject to\n          a material misrepresentation is typically unsellable or subject to repurchase if it is sold prior to detection of the misrepresentation. The sources of the misrepresentation are often difficult to locate, and it may be difficult to recover any\n          monetary loss the Company may suffer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeclines in loans outstanding could have a material adverse impact on the Company's operating results and financial condition.\n\n          Growing and diversifying the loan portfolio is part of the Company's strategic initiative.\u00a0 If quality loan demand does not continue to increase and the Company's loan portfolio begins to decline, the Company expects that excess liquidity will be\n          invested in marketable securities. Because loans typically yield higher returns than the Company's securities portfolio, a shift towards investments in the Company's asset mix would likely result in an overall reduction in net interest income and\n          the net interest margin. The principal source of earnings for the Company is net interest income, and as discussed above, the Company's net interest margin is a major determinant of the Company's profitability. The effects of a reduction in net\n          interest income and the net interest margin may be exacerbated by the intense competition for quality loans in the Company's primary service area and by rate reductions on loans currently held in the portfolio. As a result, a reduction in loans\n          could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operating results and financial condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe small-to-medium size businesses the Company targets may have fewer financial resources to weather a downturn in the economy, which could\n            materially harm operating results. \nThe Company targets individual and small-to-medium size business customers. Small-to-medium size businesses frequently have smaller market shares than their competitors, may be more vulnerable to\n          economic downturns or periods of significant inflation, often need substantial additional capital to expand and compete and may experience significant volatility in operating results. Any one or more of these factors may impair a borrower's\n          ability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small-to-medium size business often depends on the management talents and efforts of one person or a small group of persons, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these\n          persons could have a material adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay a loan. Economic downturns and other events that negatively impact businesses in the Company's primary service area could have a proportionately greater impact\n          on small-to-medium-size businesses and accordingly could cause the Company to incur substantial credit losses that could negatively affect its results of operations and financial condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses.\n A significant source of risk arises from the possibility\n          that losses could be sustained because borrowers, guarantors, and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans and leases. There is no precise method to predict loan losses. Like all financial institutions, the\n          Company maintains an allowance for loan losses (ALL) to provide for loan defaults and non-performance. Accounting measurements related to impairment and the allowance for loan losses require significant estimates that are subject to uncertainty\n          and changes relating to new information and changing circumstances. The allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses. In addition, future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect, and have in\n          recent years materially and adversely affected, the Company's operating results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe allowance for loan losses is determined by analyzing historical loan losses, current trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, plans for problem loan resolutions, changes in the size and\n          composition of the loan portfolio and industry information. Also included in management's estimates for loan losses are considerations with respect to the impact of economic events that management believes may cause future losses to deviate from\n          historical experience, the outcome of which are uncertain. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment. The amount of future losses is susceptible to\n          changes in economic and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, that may be beyond the Company's control and these future losses may exceed current estimates. If management's assumptions prove to be incorrect or if the Company\n          experiences significant loan losses in future periods, the current level of the allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses and adjustments may be necessary. In addition, federal regulatory agencies, as an integral\n          part of their examination process, review the Company's loans and allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses or recognition of additional loan charge-offs, based on judgments different from those of\n          management. While management believes that the Company's allowance is adequate to cover current losses, the Company cannot assure investors that it will not need to increase the allowance or that regulators will not require the allowance to be\n          increased. Either of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect earnings and profitability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued a new accounting standard that will be effective for the Corporation for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2023. This standard,\n          Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 326, \u201c\nFinancial Instruments\u2014Credit Losses\n\u201d (ASC 326) will require the Company to record an allowance for credit losses that represents expected credit losses\n          over the lifetime of all loans in its portfolio. This represents a change from the current method of providing for an allowance for loan losses that have been incurred. The Company has not yet determined the impact that ASC 326 will have on the\n          consolidated financial statements and regulatory capital. While the adoption of ASC 326 will not affect ultimate loan performance or cash flows of the Company from making loans, the period in which expected credit losses affect net income of the\n          Company may not be similar to the recognition of loan losses under current accounting guidance. If recognition of the allowance for credit losses results in a reduction of the regulatory capital of the Bank, the initial reduction in regulatory\n          capital will be phased in over three years under regulatory guidance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Factors Related to our Industry\n\n\nThe Company is subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may negatively affect its financial performance. \nThe\n          Company's profitability depends in substantial part on its net interest margin, which is the difference between the rates received on loans and investments and the rates paid for deposits and other sources of funds. The net interest margin\n          depends on many factors that are partly or completely outside of the Company's control, including competition; federal economic, monetary and fiscal policies; market interest rates; and economic conditions. Because of the differences in the\n          maturities and repricing characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on\n          interest-bearing liabilities. If the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, the Company may\u00a0 not be able to reflect increasing market interest rates in rates charged on loans due to competitive pressures. Accordingly, fluctuations in interest\n          rates could adversely affect the Company's net interest margin and, in turn, its profitability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company generally seeks to maintain a neutral position in terms of the volume of assets and liabilities that mature or re-price during any period so that it may reasonably maintain its net\n          interest margin; however, interest rate fluctuations, loan prepayments, loan production, deposit flows, and competitive pressures are constantly changing and influence the ability to maintain a neutral position. Generally, the Company's earnings\n          will be more sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates depending upon the variance in volume of assets and liabilities that mature and re-price in any period. The extent and duration of the sensitivity will depend on the cumulative variance\n          over time, the velocity and direction of changes in interest rates, shape and slope of the yield curve, and whether the Company is more asset sensitive or liability sensitive. Accordingly, the Company may not be successful in maintaining a\n          neutral position and, as a result, the Company's net interest margin may be affected. For additional details, See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2013 Interest Sensitivity\" in Item 7 of this\n          report on Form 10-K.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, any substantial and prolonged increase in market interest rates could reduce the Company's customers' desire to borrow money or adversely affect their ability to repay their\n          outstanding loans by increasing their credit costs. Interest rate changes could also affect the fair value of the Company's financial assets and liabilities. Accordingly, changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely\n          affect the Company's net interest margin, asset quality, loan origination volume, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe rely substantially on deposits obtained from customers in our target markets to provide liquidity and support growth.\n\n\nThe Bank\u2019s business strategies are based on access to funding from local customer deposits. Deposit levels may be affected by a number of factors, including interest rates paid by competitors,\n          general interest rate levels, returns available to customers on alternative investments and general economic conditions that affect savings levels and the amount of liquidity in the economy, including government stimulus efforts in response to\n          economic crises. If deposit levels fall, reliance on a relatively low-cost source of funding could be reduced and interest expense would likely increase as alternative funding is obtained to replace lost deposits. If local customer deposits are\n          not sufficient to fund normal operations and growth, the Company will look to outside sources, such as borrowings from the FHLB, which is a secured funding source. Ability to access borrowings from the FHLB will be dependent upon whether and the\n          extent to which collateral is held or can be provided to secure FHLB borrowings. Other sources may be federal funds purchased and brokered deposits, although the use of brokered deposits may be limited or discouraged by our banking regulators.\n          The Company may also seek to raise funds through the issuance of shares of common stock, or other equity or equity-related securities, or debt securities including subordinated notes as additional sources of liquidity. If the Company is unable to\n          access funding sufficient to support business operations and growth strategies or are unable to access such funding on attractive terms, we may not be able to implement our business strategies which may negatively affect financial performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation which could adversely affect them.\n The Company is subject to\n          extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities and is subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on part or all of operations, including those referenced\n          above. Regulations adopted by these agencies, which are generally intended to protect depositors and customers rather than to benefit stockholders, govern a comprehensive range of matters including, without limitation, ownership and control of\n          the Company's shares, acquisition of other companies and businesses, permissible activities that the Company and its subsidiaries may engage in, maintenance of adequate capital levels and other aspects of operations. These regulations could limit\n          the Company's growth by restricting certain of its activities. The laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Company are subject to regular modification and change. Regulatory changes could subject the Company to more demanding regulatory\n          compliance requirements which could affect the Company in unpredictable and adverse ways. Such changes could subject the Company to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products it may offer and/or increase the ability of\n          non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or damage to the Company's\n          reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Legislation and regulatory initiatives containing wide-ranging proposals for altering the structure, regulation and\n          competitive relationship of financial institutions are introduced regularly. The Company cannot predict in what form or whether a proposed statute or regulation will be adopted or the extent to which such adoption may affect its business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket risk affects the earnings of Trust. \nThe fee structure of Trust is generally based upon the market value of accounts under\n          administration. Most of these accounts are invested in equities of publicly traded companies and debt obligations of both government agencies and publicly traded companies. As such, fluctuations in the equity and debt markets in general have had\n          a direct impact upon the earnings of Trust.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompliance with the CFPB regulations aimed at the mortgage banking industry may require substantial changes to mortgage lending systems and\n            processes that may adversely affect income from the Company's residential mortgage activities. \nThe CFPB has finalized a number of significant rules that impact nearly every aspect of the lifecycle of a residential real estate loan.\n          Among other things, the rules adopted by the CFPB require mortgage lenders either to make a reasonable and good faith determination, based on verified and documented information, that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable\n          ability to repay the loan according to its terms, or to originate \"qualified mortgages.\" In June 2015, the CFPB issued rules that combined disclosures previously established by the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures\n          Act into a single disclosure referred to as the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure, or TRID. TRID applies to most closed-end mortgage loans and overhauls the manner in which mortgage loan origination disclosures are made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company does originate first mortgage loans. TRID also applies to second mortgages originated by the Company (but not to equity lines of credit). In recent years, the Company has made\n          significant changes to its residential real estate business, including investments in technology and employee training. These CFPB rules, in addition to other previously-issued and to-be-issued CFPB regulations, could materially affect the\n          Company's ability to originate and sell residential real estate loans or limit the terms on which the Company may offer products, which could adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Basel III Capital Rules require higher levels of capital and liquidity, which could adversely affect the Company's net income and return\n            on equity.\n The capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines under the Basel III Capital Rules began to be phased in beginning in 2015. The Basel III Capital Rules, fully phased in as of January 1, 2019, require bank holding companies and\n          banks to maintain substantially more capital as a result of higher minimum capital levels and more demanding regulatory capital risk-weightings and calculations. . The Basel III Capital Rules apply to the Bank but, because the Company expects to\n          qualify under the Federal Reserve\u2019s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement, the Company is not subject to the Basel III Capital Rules. The changes to the standardized calculations of risk-weighted assets are complex and may create additional\n          compliance burdens for the Company and the Bank. The Basel III Capital Rules require the Company and the Bank to substantially change the manner in which they collect and report information to calculate risk-weighted assets and may increase\n          dramatically risk-weighted assets as a result of applying higher risk weightings to many types of loans and securities. As a result, the Bank may be forced to limit originations of certain types of commercial and mortgage loans, thereby reducing\n          the amount of credit available to borrowers and limiting opportunities to earn interest income from the loan portfolio, which may have a detrimental impact on the Company's net income.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Company were to require additional capital, including to fund additional capital contributions to the Bank, as a result of the Basel III Capital Rules, it could be required to access the\n          capital markets on short notice and in relatively weak economic conditions, which could result in raising capital that significantly dilutes existing stockholders. Additionally, the Company may be forced to limit banking operations and\n          activities, and growth of loan portfolios and interest income, to focus on retention of earnings to improve capital levels. Higher capital levels may also lower the Company's return on equity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company may be adversely affected by changes in government monetary policy. \nAs a bank holding company, the Company's business is\n          affected by the monetary policies established by the FRB, which regulates the national money supply in order to mitigate recessionary and inflationary pressures. In setting its policy, the FRB may utilize techniques such as the following: (i)\n          engaging in open market transactions in U.S. Government securities; (ii) setting the rate on member bank borrowings; and (iii) determining reserve requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese techniques determine, to a significant extent, the Company's cost of funds for lending and investing. These techniques, all of which are outside the Company's control, may have an adverse\n          effect on deposit levels, net interest margin, loan demand or the Company's business and operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeposit insurance premiums could increase in the future, which may adversely affect future financial performance. \nThe FDIC insures\n          deposits at FDIC insured financial institutions, including the Bank. The FDIC charges insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the DIF at a certain level. Economic conditions from 2008 to 2011 increased the rate of bank failures and\n          expectations for further bank failures, requiring the FDIC to make payments for insured deposits from the DIF. If the FDIC takes action to replenish the DIF, or if the Bank's asset size increases, the Bank's FDIC insurance premiums could\n          increase, which could have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Factors Related to our Operations and Technology\n\n\nSystem failures, interruptions, breaches of security, or the failure of a third-party provider to perform its obligations could adversely\n            impact the Company's business operations and financial condition.\n Communications and information systems are essential to the conduct of the Company's businesses, as such systems are used to manage customer relationships, general ledger,\n          deposits and loans. While the Company has established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures, interruptions and security breaches, the Company's information, security, and other systems may stop operating\n          properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events beyond the Company's control, such as sudden increases in customer transaction volume, electrical or telecommunications outages, natural disasters, and\n          cyber-attacks. Information security risks have increased in recent years and hackers, activists and other external parties have become more technically sophisticated and well-resourced. These parties use a variety of methods to attempt to breach\n          security systems and access the data of financial services institutions and their customers.\u00a0 The Company may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. In addition, any\n          compromise of the security systems could deter customers from using the Bank's website and online banking service, both of which involve the transmission of confidential information. The security and authentication precautions imposed by the\n          Company and the Bank may not protect the systems from compromises or breaches of security, which would adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, the Company outsources certain data processing to certain third-party providers. Accordingly, the Company's operations are exposed to risk that these third-party providers will not\n          perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service agreements. If the third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if the Company has difficulty in communicating with them, the Company's ability to adequately process and\n          account for customer transactions could be affected, and the Company's business operations could be adversely impacted. Further, a breach of a third-party provider's technology may cause loss to the Company's customers. Replacing these\n          third-party providers could also create significant delay and expense. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe occurrence of any systems failure, interruption or breach of security, or the failure of a third-party provider to perform its obligations, could expose the Company to risks of data loss or\n          data misuse, could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, could damage the Company's reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, could subject it to additional regulatory scrutiny or could expose it to civil\n          litigation, possible financial liability and costly response measures. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries, including the Bank, and its and their employees and customers may in the future be the target of\n              criminal cyberattacks; and we could be exposed to liability and remedial costs, and our reputation and business could suffer. \nLike many major financial institutions, we are, from time to time, a target of criminal cyber-attacks,\n            phishing schemes and similar fraudulent activity and cyber incidents, and we expect these threats to continue.\u00a0 As the numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats, including advanced and persistent cyber-attacks and schemes, utilized by\n            cybercriminals in attempts to obtain unauthorized access to our systems or our customers\u2019 accounts have become increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may \u2013 like many other major\n            financial institutions \u2013\u00a0 not anticipate, safeguard against, or respond to, these acts adequately.\u00a0 As these threats continue to evolve and increase, we \u2013 like many other major financial institutions \u2013 may be required to devote significant\n            additional resources in order to modify and enhance our security controls and to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough it is difficult to determine what, if any, harm may directly result from any specific cyber incident or cyber-attack, any failure to maintain the security of, or any actual or perceived\n          loss or unauthorized disclosure or use of, customer or account information likely may lead to our customers losing trust and confidence in us.\u00a0 Damage to our reputation could adversely affect deposits and loans and otherwise negatively affect the\n          Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\u00a0 In addition, it is possible that a cyber incident and any material fraudulent activity, cyber-attacks, breaches of our information security or successful penetration or\n          circumvention of our system security may cause us significant negative consequences, including loss of Bank customers and financial assets and business opportunities, disruption to our operations and business, or misappropriation of our and/or\n          our customers\u2019 confidential information, and may expose us to additional regulatory scrutiny or may result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of\n          confidence in our security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, devotion of substantial management time, increased costs to maintain insurance coverage (including increased deposit insurance premiums), or\n          additional compliance costs, all of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFailure to comply with the USA Patriot Act, OFAC, the Bank Secrecy Act and related FinCEN guidelines and related regulations could have a\n              material impact on the Company. \nBank regulatory agencies routinely examine financial institutions for compliance with the USA Patriot Act, OFAC, the Bank Secrecy Act and related FinCEN guidelines and related regulations. Failure to\n            maintain and implement adequate programs as required by these obligations to combat terrorist financing, elder abuse, human trafficking, anti-money laundering and other suspicious activity and to fully comply with all of the relevant laws or\n            regulations, could have serious legal, financial and reputational consequences for the Company. Such a failure could cause a bank regulatory agency not to approve a merger or acquisition transaction or to prohibit such a transaction even if\n            formal approval is not required. In addition, such a failure could result in a regulatory authority imposing a formal enforcement action or civil money penalty for regulatory violations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe Company's accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting models.\n\u00a0\nProcesses that management uses to measure the fair value of financial instruments, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on the Company's earnings performance\n          and liquidity, depend upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if these assumptions are accurate,\n          the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the models that management uses for interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, the Company may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest\n          rates or other market measures and may be unable to maintain sufficient liquidity. If the models that management uses to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate\n          unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what the Company could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments. Any such failure in management's analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on the\n          Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company is dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel could harm its business. \nThe banking\n          business in Virginia, and in the Company's primary service area in the Hampton Roads MSA, is highly competitive and dominated by a relatively small number of large banks. Competition for qualified employees and personnel in the banking industry\n          is intense and there are a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of and experience in the Virginia community banking industry. The Company's success depends to a significant degree upon its ability to attract and retain qualified\n          management, loan origination, administrative, marketing and technical personnel and upon the continued contributions of and customer relationships developed by management and personnel. In particular, the Company's success is highly dependent\n          upon the capabilities of its senior executive management. The Company believes that its management team, comprised of individuals who have worked in the banking industry for many years, is integral to implementing the Company's business plan. The\n          Company has not entered into employment agreements with any of its executive management employees, and the loss of the services of one or more of them could harm the Company's business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company's future success depends on its ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive financial services industry. \nThe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Company faces substantial competition in all phases of its operations from a variety of different competitors. Growth and success depend on the Company's ability to compete effectively in this highly competitive financial services environment.\n          Many competitors offer products and services that are not offered by the Company, and many have substantially greater resources, name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business. In addition, larger competitors may be\n          able to price loans and deposits more aggressively and may have larger lending limits that would allow them to serve the credit needs of larger customers. In addition, financial technology start-ups are emerging in key areas of banking.\u00a0 Some of\n          the financial services organizations with which the Company competes are not subject to the same degree of regulation as is imposed on bank holding companies and federally insured national banks, and may have broader geographic services areas and\n          lower cost structures.\u00a0 As a result, these non-bank competitors have certain advantages over the Company in accessing funding and in providing various services. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of\n          legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Failure to compete effectively to attract new and retain current customers in the Company's markets could cause it to lose market share, slow its growth rate and may\n          have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company may not be able to compete effectively without the appropriate use of current technology.\n The use of technology in the\n          financial services market, including the banking industry, evolves frequently. The Company may be unable to attract and maintain banking relationships with certain customers if it does not offer appropriate technology-driven products and\n          services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology may increase efficiency and reduce costs. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products or services or be successful in\n          marketing these products and services to its customers. As a result, the Company's ability to compete effectively may be impaired, which could lead to a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s common stock price may be volatile, which could result in losses to investors. \nThe common stock price has been\n          volatile in the past, and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate in the future. These factors include, but are not limited to, actual or anticipated variations in earnings, changes in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections with\n          regard to the Company\u2019s common stock or the markets and businesses in which the Company operates, operations and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers, and reports of trends and concerns and other issues related to the financial\n          services industry. Fluctuations in our common stock price may be unrelated to the Company\u2019s performance. General market declines or market volatility in the future, especially in the financial institutions sector, could adversely affect the price\n          of our common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company's substantial dependence on dividends from its subsidiaries may prevent it from paying dividends to its stockholders and\n            adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition. \nThe Company is a separate legal entity from its subsidiaries and does not have significant operations or revenues of its own. The Company substantially depends\n          on dividends from its subsidiaries to pay dividends to stockholders and to pay its operating expenses. The availability of dividends from the subsidiaries is limited by various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the\n          financial condition of the Company and other factors, that the Comptroller could assert that payment of dividends by the subsidiaries is an unsafe or unsound practice. In the event the subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends to the Company, the\n          Company may not be able to pay dividends on the Company's common stock, service debt or pay operating expenses. Consequently, the inability to receive dividends from the subsidiaries could adversely affect the Company's financial condition,\n          results of operations, cash flows and limit stockholders' return, if any, to capital appreciation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture sales of the Company's common stock by stockholders or the perception that those sales could occur may cause the common stock price\n            to decline. \nAlthough the Company's common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ stock market, the trading volume in the common stock may be lower than that of other larger financial institutions. A public trading market having the\n          desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of the common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general\n          economic and market conditions over which the Company has no control. Given the potential for lower relative trading volume in the common stock, significant sales of the common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales may\n          occur, could cause the trading price of the Company's common stock to decline or to be lower than it otherwise might be in the absence of these sales or perceptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture issuances of the Company's common stock could adversely affect the market price of the common stock and could be dilutive. \nThe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Company may issue additional shares of common stock or securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, shares of the Company's common stock. Issuances of a substantial number of shares of common\n          stock, or the expectation that such issuances might occur, could materially adversely affect the market price of the common stock and could be dilutive to stockholders. Any decision the Company makes to issue common stock in the future will\n          depend on market conditions and other factors, and the Company cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of possible future issuances of common stock. Accordingly, holders of the Company's common stock bear the risk that future\n          issuances of securities will reduce the market price of the common stock and dilute their stock holdings in the Company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Factors Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the widespread government response and the impact on consumers and businesses have caused significant disruption in the United States and international\n          economies and financial markets and may have had or may have a significant impact on consumers and businesses in our market area and the operations and financial performance of the Company. Governments, businesses and the public initially\n          responded to the pandemic in ways that resulted in a significant disruption of economic activity, and the businesses of many of our customers have been adversely impacted, which could result in adverse impacts on our results of operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the scope, duration and full effects of the pandemic are evolving and cannot be fully known at this time, consequences of the pandemic have included and may include further market\n          volatility, lower interest rates, disrupted trade and supply chains, increased unemployment, rising prices, inflation and reduced economic activity. The period of recovery from the negative economic effects of the pandemic cannot be predicted and\n          may be protracted. The effects of the pandemic on our borrowers has been mitigated by loan payment deferral programs and government stimulus or relief efforts, such as the PPP. However, as these programs have largely ended, signs of credit\n          deterioration that were masked or obscured may emerge, and the Company can give no assurance that loan performance or net charge-offs will continue at the historically low levels experienced in 2021 and 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be\n          predicted, including, but not limited to the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the acceptance and continued effectiveness of vaccines and treatments for COVID-19, the effects of the pandemic on our customers and vendors, the short-\n          and long-term health impacts of the pandemic, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. If the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic worsens, additional actions may be taken by federal, state, and local\n          governments, or public behavior may change in response to evolving circumstances, to mitigate its effects. There can be no assurance that any efforts by the Company to address the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will be effective. Even\n          after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of changes in the behavior of customers, businesses and their employees. Furthermore, the financial condition of our customers and\n          vendors may be adversely impacted, which may result in an elevated level of loan losses, a decrease in demand for our products and services, or reduced availability of services provided by third parties on which we rely. Any of these events may,\n          in turn, have a material adverse impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to operational risk, which could adversely affect business, financial condition and results of\n            operation. \nThe Company and its subsidiaries, like all businesses, are subject to operational risk, including the risk of loss resulting from human error, fraud or unauthorized transactions due to inadequate or failed internal processes\n          and systems, and external events that are wholly or partially beyond the Company's control (including, for example, sudden increases in customer transaction volume, electrical or telecommunications outages, natural disasters, and cyber-attacks).\n          Operational risk also encompasses compliance (legal) risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards. The Company and its subsidiaries have established\n          a system of internal controls to address these risks, but there are inherent limitations to such risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that are not anticipated, identified or monitored. Any losses\n          resulting from operational risk could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, litigation costs, harm to reputation or forgone opportunities, loss of customer business, or the unauthorized release, misuse, loss or\n          destruction of proprietary information, any and all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNegative public opinion could damage the Company's reputation and adversely impact the Company's business, financial condition and results\n            of operation. \nReputation risk, or the risk to the Company's business, financial condition and results of operation from negative public opinion, is inherent in the financial services industry. Negative public opinion can result from\n          actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending or foreclosure practices, regulatory compliance, corporate governance and sharing or inadequately protecting customer information, and from actions taken by government\n          regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion could adversely affect the Company's ability to keep and attract customers and employees, could expose it to litigation and regulatory action, and\n          could adversely affect its access to the capital markets. Damage to the Company's reputation could adversely affect deposits and loans and otherwise negatively affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company may need to raise additional capital in the future and such capital may not be available when needed or at all. \nThe\n          Company may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide it with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet its commitments and business needs, particularly if its asset quality or earnings were to deteriorate significantly.\n          Economic conditions and the loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase the Company's cost of funding and limit access to certain customary sources of capital, including inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings\n          from the Federal Reserve Bank's discount window. The Company's ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of the Company's control, and the\n          Company's financial performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company cannot assure that such capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may limit the Company's access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the\n          confidence of debt purchasers, depositors of the Bank or counterparties participating in the capital markets, or a downgrade of the parent company or the Bank's ratings, may adversely affect the Company's capital costs and its ability to raise\n          capital and, in turn, its liquidity. Moreover, if the Company needs to raise capital in the future, it may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would have to compete with those institutions\n          for investors. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on the Company's liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNatural disasters, severe weather events, acts of war or terrorism, pandemics or endemics, climate change and other external events could\n            significantly impact our business. \nNatural disasters, including severe weather events of increasing strength and frequency due to climate change, acts of war (including the ongoing conflict in Ukraine) or terrorism, pandemics (including\n          the COVID-19 pandemic) or endemics and other adverse external events could have a significant adverse impact on the business operations of the Company, third parties who perform operational services for the Company or its customers and the\n          Company\u2019s borrowers and customers. Such events could affect the stability of the Company\u2019s deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage,\n          result in lost revenue or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. Although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s\n          business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate change or societal responses to climate change could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and performance, including indirectly\n            through impacts on its customers and vendors.\nClimate change can increase the likelihood of the occurrence and severity of natural disasters and can also result in longer-term shifts in climate patterns such as extreme heat, sea level\n          rise and more frequent and prolonged drought. The effects of climate change may have a significant effect on the Company\u2019s geographic markets, and could disrupt the operations of the Company, its customers, third parties on which it relies, or\n          supply chains more generally. Those disruptions could result in declines in economic conditions in geographic markets or industries in which the Company\u2019s borrowers operate and impact their ability to repay loans or maintain deposits. Climate\n          change could also impact the Company\u2019s assets or employees directly or lead to changes in customer preferences that could negatively affect the Company\u2019s growth or the Company\u2019s business strategies. In addition, the Company\u2019s reputation and\n          customer relationships could be damaged due to its practices related to climate change, including its or its customers\u2019 involvement in certain industries or projects associated with causing or exacerbating climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "item7": ">Item 7.\n\n    \n\n\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe following discussion is intended to assist readers in understanding and evaluating the financial condition, changes in financial condition and the results of operations of the Company,\n          consisting of the parent company (the Parent) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Bank and Trust. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information contained elsewhere in\n          this report.\u00a0 In addition to current and historical information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to\n          future business, financial condition or results of operations. For a description of certain factors that may have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s future business, financial condition or results of operations, see \u201cCautionary Statement\n          Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d prior to Item 1. \u201cBusiness.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s primary goals are to maximize earnings by maintaining strong asset quality and deploying capital in profitable growth initiatives that will enhance long-term stockholder value.\n          The Company operates in three principal business segments: the Bank, the Trust, and the Company as a separate segment, the Parent. Revenues from the Bank\u2019s operations consist primarily of interest earned on loans and investment securities, fees\n          earned on deposit accounts, debit card interchange, and treasury and commercial services and mortgage banking income.

Capital growth resulted primarily from earnings for the year ended December 31, 2021,\n          partially offset by increased cash dividends and net unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities, a component of accumulated comprehensive income.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company declared dividends of $0.50 per share. Annual dividends per share increased 4.2% over dividends of $0.48 per share declared in\n            2020. The Board of Directors of the Company continually reviews the amount of cash dividends per share and the resulting dividend payout ratio. T\nhe Company\u2019s principal goals related to the maintenance of capital are to provide adequate\n          capital to support the Company\u2019s risk profile consistent with the board approved risk appetite, provide financial flexibility to support future growth and client needs, comply with relevant laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance, and provide\n          a competitive return to stockholders. Risk-based capital ratios, which include CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital for the Bank are calculated based on regulatory guidance related to the measurement of capital and risk-weighted assets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffective October 19, 2021, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program. The Company is authorized pursuant to this program to repurchase up to 10% of the Company\u2019s issued and outstanding\n          common stock through November 30, 2022. Repurchases under the program may be made through privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions, including pursuant to a trading plan in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 and/or Rule 10b-18 under\n          the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and shares repurchased will be returned to the status of authorized and unissued shares of common stock. The timing, number and purchase price of shares repurchased under the program, if any, will\n          be determined by management in its discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of the shares as a percentage of tangible book value, general market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other\n          conditions, and there is no assurance that the Company will purchase any shares under the program.\n During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company repurchased 6,600 shares, or $150 thousand of its common\n            stock under the 2021 repurchase program. \nDuring the first quarter of 2022, approximately 111,000 shares were repurchased by the Company under this plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the book value per share of the Company\u2019s common stock was $23.06, and tangible book value per share (non-GAAP) was $22.69, compared to $22.42 and $22.05, respectively, at\n          December 31, 2020. Refer to \u201cNon-GAAP Financial Measures,\u201d below, for information about non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\n\nThe accounting and reporting policies of the Company are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and conform to general practices within the banking industry.\n          The Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations are affected by management\u2019s application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts\n          reported for revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial position and/or results of operations. Those accounting\n          policies with the greatest uncertainty and that require management\u2019s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments affecting the application of these policies, and the greatest likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported\n          under different conditions, or using different assumptions, are described below\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllowance for Loan Losses\n\n\nThe allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when it is believed the\n          collection of the principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries of losses previously charged against the allowance are credited to the allowance. The allowance represents an amount that, in the Company\u2019s judgment, will be adequate to absorb\n          probable and estimable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The judgment in determining the level of the allowance is based on evaluations of the collectability of loans while taking into consideration such factors as trends in delinquencies\n          and charge-offs for relevant periods of time, changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions that may affect a borrower\u2019s ability to repay and the value of collateral, overall portfolio quality and review of\n          specific potential losses. This evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. In evaluating the level of the allowance, management considers a\n          range of possible assumptions and outcomes related to the various factors identified above. Under alternative assumptions that we considered in developing our estimate of an allowance that will be adequate to absorb probable and estimable losses\n          inherent in the loan portfolio at December 31, 2021, our estimate of the allowance varied between $7 million and $10 million.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor further information concerning accounting policies, refer to Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. \u201cFinancial\n          Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report on Form 10-K.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults of Operations\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNet Interest Income\n\n\nThe principal source of earnings for the Company is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest and fees generated by earning assets and interest expense paid to\n          fund them. Changes in the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as their respective yields and rates, have a significant impact on the level of net interest income. The NIM is calculated by dividing\n          tax-equivalent net interest income by average earning assets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet interest income was $38.8 million in 2021, an increase of $4.1 million from 2020. The NIM was 3.24% in 2021 as compared to 3.18% in 2020. Net interest income, on a fully\n            tax-equivalent basis, was $39.0 million in 2021, an increase of $4.2 million from 2020. On a fully tax-equivalent basis, NIM was 3.26% in 2021 as compared to 3.19% in 2020. Year-over-year, average loan yields were higher by 19 basis points.\n            While the lower interest rate environment during 2021 resulted in lower average yields on new loan originations, including PPP loans, which earn interest at a fixed 1%, and repricing within the existing loan portfolio, average loan yields were\n            higher due to accelerated recognition of deferred fees and costs related to PPP forgiveness and the collection of prepayment penalties on one commercial relationship. Loan fees and costs related to PPP loans are deferred at time of loan\n            origination, are amortized into interest income over the remaining terms of the loans and accelerated upon forgiveness or repayment of the PPP loans. Net PPP fees of $3.2 million and $813 thousand were recognized in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n            As of December 31, 2021, unamortized net deferred PPP fees were $630 thousand. High levels of liquidity invested at lower yielding short-term levels in the low interest rate environment also continue to impact the NIM.\n For more\n          information about these FTE financial measures, please see \u201cNon-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage loans, which includes both loans held for investment and loans held for sale, increased $7.5 million to $841.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020. Average loans held for\n          investment included $53.5 million and $63.8 million of average balances of loans originated under the PPP for 2021 and 2020, respectively. The remaining increase in average loans outstanding 2021 compared to 2020 was due primarily to growth in\n          the commercial real estate segment of the loan portfolio. Average securities available for sale increased $42.5 million for 2021, compared to 2020, due primarily to higher purchases of securities. The average yield on the securities portfolio on\n          a taxable-equivalent basis decreased 22 basis points for 2021, compared to 2020, due to purchases of securities in 2020 and 2021 at lower average yields relative to the average yield of the portfolio as a whole.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage money market, savings and interest-bearing demand deposits increased $99.3 million and average time deposits decreased $29.5 million, for the year ended 2021, respectively, compared to the same periods in\n          2020, due to growth in consumer and business deposits primarily as a result of new accounts and liquidity from government stimulus programs as well as a shift from time deposits as a result of lower interest rates. Average noninterest-bearing\n          demand deposits increased $66.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased 27 basis points for 2021 compared to the same 2020 period, due primarily to lower\n          rates on deposits and a shift in composition from time deposits. While changes in rates take effect immediately for interest checking, money market and savings accounts, changes in the average cost of time deposits lag changes in pricing based on\n          the repricing of time deposits at maturity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage borrowings decreased $44.8 million year-over-year due primarily to the repayment of PPPLF borrowings during 2021 and long-term borrowings in 2020. The average cost of borrowings increased 87 basis points\n          during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to the issuance of subordinated notes by the Company during July 2021 partially offset by the repayment of higher-cost long-term borrowings during 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following table shows an analysis of average earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and rates and yields.

in future periods by several factors that are difficult to predict, including (1) changes in interest rates, which may depend on the\n            severity of adverse economic conditions, the timing and extent of any economic recovery, and the extent or continuing impact of government stimulus measures, which are inherently uncertain, (2) possible changes in the composition of earning\n            assets which may result from decreased loan demand as a result of the current economic environment; and (3) the recognition of net deferred fees on PPP loans, which is subject to the timing of repayment or forgiveness.\n\u00a0\nHowever, if market interest rates rise to a meaningful degree in 2022, as some financial markets predict, the Company may benefit from higher yields on certain interest earning assets, which would be expected to\n            outpace any increases in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion of net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 has been omitted as such discussion was provided in Part II, Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis,\u201d under the\n          heading \u201cNet Interest Income\u201d in the \nCompany\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K\n, which was filed with the SEC on March 30, 2021, and is incorporated herein\n          by reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvision for Loan Losses\n\n\nThe provision for loan losses is a charge against earnings necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level consistent with management's evaluation of the portfolio. This expense\n          is based on management's estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Management\u2019s evaluation included credit quality trends, collateral values, discounted cash flow analysis, loan volumes, geographic, borrower and industry\n          concentrations, the findings of internal credit quality assessments and results from external regulatory examinations. These factors, as well as identified impaired loans, historical losses and current economic and business conditions including\n          uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, were used in developing estimated loss factors for determining the loan loss provision. Based on its analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, management concluded that the\n          provision was appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe provision for loan losses was $794 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $1.0 million for 2020. Historical loss rates, levels of non-performing assets, and credit\n          quality continued to improve in 2021 and contributed to a lower provision recognized in 2021; however, these developments were partially offset by the impact of two commercial relationships that were downgraded during 2021 and qualitative factor\n          adjustments for loan volume trends. During 2020, increased qualitative reserves primarily related to uncertainties associated with expected asset quality deterioration as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruption offset by\n          improvements in qualitative historical loss factors.\u00a0 Charged-off loans totaled $1.1 million in 2021, compared to $2.0 million in 2020. Recoveries amounted to $649 thousand in 2021 and $886 thousand in 2020. The Company\u2019s net loans charged off to\n          average loans were 0.06% in 2021 as compared to 0.13% in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe state of the local economy can have a significant impact on the level of loan charge-offs. If the economy begins to contract, nonperforming assets could increase as a result of declines in\n          real estate values and home sales or increases in unemployment rates and financial stress on borrowers. Increased nonperforming assets would increase charge-offs and reduce earnings due to larger contributions to the loan loss provision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoninterest Income\n\n\nUnless otherwise noted, all comparisons in this section are between the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoninterest income increased $187 thousand or 1.3% for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. In 2021, increases in fiduciary and asset management\n          fees ($321 thousand or 8.3%), other service charges, commissions and fees ($141 thousand or 3.50%), bank-owned life insurance income ($175 thousand or 20.9%), and mortgage banking income ($499 thousand or 28.0%) were partially offset by\n          nonrecurring gains on sale of real estate ($818 thousand) which occurred in 2020. Trust\u2019s operating results improved significantly from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to increased fiduciary and asset management fees across Trust\u2019s retirement\n          solutions, wealth management and trust business lines, as well as strong market performance during 2021 that increased Trust client account balances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther service charges, commissions and fees increased primarily due to growth in merchant processing income, debit card fee income, and telephone payment fees.\u00a0 \nMortgage\n          banking income increased primarily due to (i) higher volume resulting from the current low interest rate environment, (ii) higher gains on sales of loans as a result of higher margins on loan originated for resale and (iii) expansion of the\n          mortgage lending team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company continues to focus on diversifying noninterest income through efforts to expand Trust, insurance, and mortgage banking activities, and a continued focus on business checking and other corporate\n          services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion of noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 has been omitted as such discussion was provided in Part II, Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis,\u201d under the heading \u201cNoninterest\n          Income\u201d in the \nCompany\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K\n. which was filed with the SEC on March 30, 2021, and is incorporated by reference herein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoninterest Expense\n\n\nUnless otherwise noted, all comparisons in this section are between the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s noninterest expense increased $644 thousand or 1.5%. Year-over-year increases were primarily related to data processing, professional services and, other operating expense\n          partially offset by decreased ATM and other losses and losses related to FHLB prepayments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring 2021, data processing expenses increased $1.1 million or 31.0% as the Company fully executed and implemented multiple solutions as part of the ongoing roadmap for bank-wide technology\n          and operating efficiency initiatives. Initiatives completed during 2021 include a new loan origination system, new online appointment scheduling system, bank-wide ATM upgrades, a new deposit origination platform, a new data analytics solution,\n          and a new payments platform. Critical infrastructure software related to imaging, a new teller platform, and a new online account opening solution are expected to reach completion in first quarter 2022. These initiatives have driven\n          period-over-period increases in data processing costs during the implementation and transition time frames as our operational structure pivoted from in-house to outsourced environments and shifted costs previously included in occupancy and\n          equipment expense. Implementing, integrating, and leveraging these digital and technological strategies as fully implemented and integrated solutions to gain operational efficiencies will remain one area of focus in 2022. The Company is actively\n          engaged in assessing major vendor contracts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the remaining categories of noninterest expense, the most significant changes when comparing 2021 to 2020 were in:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nProfessional services, which increased $325 thousand primarily due to higher legal costs, audit expense and expenses related to the transition from in-house to outsourced data processing environments, and\n                  an increased OCC assessment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nATM and other losses, which decreased $367 thousand primarily due to lower impairment of certain low-income housing equity investments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nLoss on extinguishment of borrowings, which is related to FHLB advance prepayments of $38.5 million and was recognized in 2020. There were no similar losses during 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nOther operating expenses, which increased $260 thousand or 7.7% due primarily to an increase in FDIC insurance expense, telephone and courier expense, and other loan expenses due to costs associated with\n                  higher loan volumes.\u00a0 The Company recognized a single loss event of $85 thousand in the first quarter of 2020, which did not impact 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company also continues to focus on balance sheet repositioning, exploring disposition opportunities of under-utilized real estate and branch optimization with two branch closures completed\n          in the first quarter of 2022, as well as digital initiatives that complement this repositioning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe provision for income taxes is based upon the results of operations, adjusted for the effect of certain tax-exempt income, non-deductible expenses, and tax credits. In addition, certain\n          items of income and expense are reported in different periods for financial reporting and tax return purposes. The tax effects of these temporary differences are recognized currently in the deferred income tax provision or benefit. Deferred tax\n          assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using the applicable enacted marginal tax rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were 13.3% and 8.8%, respectively. The effective tax rate was affected by to higher pre-tax income.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion of noninterest expense and income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 has been omitted as such discussion was provided in Part II, Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and\n          Analysis,\u201d under the heading \u201cNoninterest Expense\u201d in the \nCompany\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K\n, which was filed with the SEC on March 30, 2021, and\n          in incorporated by reference herein.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance Sheet Review\n\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company had total assets of $1.3 billion, an increase of $112.0 million or 9.1% compared to assets as of December 31, 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet loans held for investment increased $6.9 million or 0.8%, from $826.8 million at December 31, 2020 to $833.7 million at December 31, 2021. The change in net loans held for\n            investment was primarily affected by a decline of $67.0 million in the PPP loan segment due to forgiveness of $115.3 million of PPP loans, partially offset by new PPP originations of $48.3 million.\u00a0 Loans held for investment, excluding PPP,\n            grew 9.9%, or $74.2 million, driven by loan growth in the following segments: commercial real estate of $66.6 million, construction, land development, and other land loans of $14.9 million, and automobile of $4.7 million. This segmented growth\n            was partially offset by decreases in commercial and industrial and multi-family residential real estate. Cash and cash equivalents increased $67.5 million or 56.0% from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021, and securities available for sale\n            increased $47.9 million or 25.7% over the same period\n as\n additional liquidity provided by growth in deposit accounts was deployed in the Company\u2019s investment portfolio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal deposits of $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2021 increased $109.9 million, or 10.3%, from December 31, 2020. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased $60.9 million, or 16.9%, savings\n          deposits increased $73.5 million, or 14.3%, and time deposits decreased $24.5 million, or 12.7%. Liquidity continues to be impacted by record cumulative levels of consumer savings, government stimulus, and PPP loan related deposits. Expanding the\n          low-cost deposit base and re-pricing to reduce interest expense to buffer NIM compression during the low rate environment were key strategies in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company utilized the PPPLF initiated by the Federal Reserve Bank to partially fund PPP loan originations. PPPLF borrowings were $480 thousand at December 31, 2021 compared to $28.6 million\n          as of December 31, 2020.\u00a0 The Company also utilizes FHLB advances as a source of liquidity as needed. At December 31, 2021, the Company had no FHLB advances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurities Portfolio\n\n\nWhen comparing December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2020, securities available-for-sale increased $47.9 million, or 25.7%. The majority of the change was due primarily to purchases of U.S.\n          Treasury securities, securities issued by state and political subdivisions, and mortgage-backed securities to deploy additional liquidity provided by growth in deposit accounts rather than holding in lower yielding cash reserves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s strategy for the securities portfolio is primarily intended to manage the portfolio\u2019s susceptibility to interest rate risk and to provide liquidity to fund loan growth. The\n          securities portfolio is also adjusted to achieve other asset/liability objectives, including pledging requirements, and to manage tax exposure when necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following

of nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest, nonperforming restructured loans, and other real estate owned (OREO). Restructured loans\n          are loans with terms that were modified in a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) for borrowers experiencing financial difficulties.

The 2021 total consisted of $1.0 million in loans still\n          accruing interest but past due 90 days or more and $478 thousand in nonaccrual loans. All of the nonaccrual loans are classified as impaired and 63.6% of the nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2021 were secured by real estate. Impaired loans are a\n          component of the allowance for loan losses. When a loan changes from \u201c90 days past due but still accruing interest\u201d to \u201cnonaccrual\u201d status, the loan is normally reviewed for impairment. If impairment is identified, then the Company records a\n          charge-off based on the value of the collateral or the present value of the loan\u2019s expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's effective interest rate. If the Company is waiting on an appraisal to determine the collateral\u2019s value,\n          management allocates funds to cover the deficiency to the allowance for loan losses based on information available to management at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recorded investment in impaired loans decreased to $1.3 million as of December 31, 2021 from $2.1 million as of December 31, 2020 as detailed in Note 4, Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses\n          of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report on Form 10-K.

For additional information, refer to Note 4, Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses of the Notes to Consolidated Financial\n                  Statements included in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this report on Form 10-K.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\nAmounts listed represent restructured loans that are in compliance with their modified terms as of the date presented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in the table above, as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020, the nonaccrual loan category decreased by $736 thousand or 60.6% and the 90-days past due and still accruing\n          interest category increased by $281 thousand or 37.8%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2021 were related to four credit relationships. All loans in these relationships have been analyzed to determine whether the cash flow of the borrower and\n          the collateral pledged to secure the loans is sufficient to cover outstanding principal balances. The Company has set aside specific allocations for those loans without sufficient cash flow or collateral and charged off any balance that\n          management does not expect to collect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of the loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest at December 31, 2021 ($711 thousand) were small business and student loans. The federal government has provided\n          guarantees of repayment of these small business and student loans in an amount ranging from 97% to 100% of the total principal and interest of the loans; as such, management does not expect even a significant increase in past due small business\n          or student loans to have a material effect on the Company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement believes the Company has excellent credit quality review processes in place to identify problem loans quickly. For a detailed discussion of the Company\u2019s nonperforming assets, refer\n          to Note 4, Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses and Note 5, Other Real Estate Owned (OREO) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report on Form 10-K.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Allowance for Loan Losses\n\n\nThe allowance for loan losses is based on several components. In evaluating the adequacy of the allowance, each segment of the loan portfolio is divided into several pools of loans:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\n\u00a0 \nSpecific identification (regardless of risk rating)\n\n\n2.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \nPool\u2013substandard\n\n\n3.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \nPool\u2013other assets especially mentioned (OAEM) (rated just above substandard)\n\n\n4.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \nPool\u2013pass loans (all other rated loans)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first component of the allowance for loan losses is determined based on specifically identified loans that may become impaired. These loans are individually analyzed for impairment and\n          include nonperforming loans and both performing and nonperforming TDRs. This component may also include loans considered impaired for other reasons, such as outdated financial information on the borrower or guarantors or financial problems of the\n          borrower, including operating losses, marginal working capital, inadequate cash flow, or business interruptions. Changes in TDRs and nonperforming loans affect the dollar amount of the allowance. Increases in the impairment allowance for TDRs and\n          nonperforming loans are reflected as an increase in the allowance for loan losses except in situations where the TDR or nonperforming loan does not require a specific allocation (i.e., the discounted present value of expected future cash flows or\n          the collateral value is considered sufficient).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of the Company's TDRs and nonperforming loans are collateralized by real estate. When reviewing loans for impairment, the Company obtains current appraisals when applicable. If the\n          Company has not yet received a current appraisal on loans being reviewed for impairment, any loan balance that is in excess of the estimated appraised value is allocated in the allowance. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the\n          impaired loan component of the allowance for loan losses amounted to $128 thousand and $11 thousand, respectively. The increase in the impaired loan component is due primarily to the impairment of one credit relationship. The impaired loan\n          component of the allowance for loan losses is reflected as a valuation allowance related to impaired loans in Note 4, Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements\n          and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report on Form 10-K.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second component of the allowance consists of qualitative factors and includes items such as economic conditions, growth trends, loan concentrations, changes in certain loans, changes in\n          underwriting, changes in management and legal and regulatory changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical loss is the final component of the allowance for loan losses. The calculation of the historical loss component is conducted on loans evaluated collectively for impairment and uses\n          migration analysis with eight migration periods covering twelve quarters each on pooled segments. These segments are based on the loan classifications set by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council in the instructions for the Call\n          Report applicable to the Bank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsumer loans not secured by real estate and made to individuals for household, family and other personal expenditures are segmented into pools based on whether the loan's payments are current\n          (including loans 1 \u2013 29 days past due), 30 \u2013 59 days past due, 60 \u2013 89 days past due, or 90 days or more past due. All other loans, including loans to consumers that are secured by real estate, are segmented by the Company's internally assigned\n          risk grades: substandard, other assets especially mentioned (rated just above substandard), and pass (all other loans). The Company may also assign loans to the risk grades of doubtful or loss, but as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020,\n          the Company had no loans in these categories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe overall historical loss rate from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021, improved 12 basis points as a percentage of loans evaluated collectively for impairment as a result of overall\n          improving asset quality combined with continued improvement in non-performing assets. For the same period, the qualitative factor components increased 3 basis points as a percentage of loans evaluated collectively for impairment overall. This\n          increase was primarily due to segment adjustments for economic conditions and uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic and change in volume for certain segments. While there have not been significant changes in overall credit quality of the\n          loan portfolio from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021, management will continue to monitor economic recovery challenges at macro and micro levels, including levels of inflation, the impacts of new COVID-19 variants, expansion and contraction\n          of pandemic-related government stimulus efforts, supply chain disruption, and employment levels, which may be delaying signs of credit deterioration. If there are further challenges to the economic recovery, elevated levels of risk within the\n          loan portfolio may require additional increases in the allowance for loan losses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a combined basis, the historical loss and qualitative factor components amounted to $9.7 million as of December 31, 2021 and $9.4 million at December 31, 2020. Management is monitoring\n          portfolio activity, such as levels of deferral and/or modification requests, deferral and/or modification concentration levels by collateral, as well as industry concentration levels to identify areas within the loan portfolio which may create\n          elevated levels of risk should the economic environment created by uncertainty related to COVID-19 pandemic present indications of economic instability that is other than temporary in nature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcquired loans are recorded at their fair value at acquisition date without carryover of the acquiree's previously established ALLL, as credit discounts are included in the determination of\n          fair value. The fair value of the loans is determined using market participant assumptions in estimating the amount and timing of both principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected on the loans and then applying a market-based\n          discount rate to those cash flows. During evaluation upon acquisition, acquired loans are also classified as either purchased credit impaired or purchased performing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcquired impaired loans reflect credit quality deterioration since origination, as it is probable at acquisition that the Company will not be able to collect all contractually required\n          payments. These acquired impaired loans are accounted for under ASC 310-30, \nReceivables \u2013 Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality\n. The acquired impaired loans are segregated\n          into pools based on loan type and credit risk. Loan type is determined based on collateral type, purpose, and lien position. Credit risk characteristics include risk rating groups, nonaccrual status, and past due status. For valuation purposes,\n          these pools are further disaggregated by maturity, pricing characteristics, and re-payment structure. Acquired impaired loans are written down at acquisition to fair value using an estimate of cash flows deemed to be collectible. Accordingly,\n          such loans are no longer classified as nonaccrual even though they may be contractually past due because the Company expects to fully collect the new carrying values of such loans, which is the new cost basis arising from purchase accounting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcquired performing loans are accounted for under ASC 310-20, \nReceivables \u2013 Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs\n. The difference between the fair value\n          and unpaid principal balance of the loan at acquisition date (premium or discount) is amortized or accreted into interest income over the life of the loans. If the acquired performing loan has revolving privileges, it is accounted for using the\n          straight-line method\u037e otherwise the effective interest method is used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall Change in Allowance\n\n\nAs a result of management's analysis, the Company added, through the provision, $794 thousand to the ALLL for the year ended December 31, 2021. The ALLL, as a percentage of\n            year-end loans held for investment, was 1.17% in 2021 and 1.14% in 2020. The increase in the ALLL as a percentage of loans held for investment at December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to an increase in loans\n            held for investment, excluding PPP loans, the downgrade of two commercial relationships and qualitative factor adjustments for economic conditions, uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and change in volume for certain segments\n            partially offset by improvement in historical loss rates. Excluding PPP loans, the ALLL as a percentage of loans held for investment was 1.20% and 1.27% at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\u00a0 Loans held for investment excluding PPP loans\n            is a non-GAAP financial measure.\n For more information about financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, please see \u201cNon-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below.\n Management believes that\n            the allowance has been appropriately funded for losses on existing loans, based on currently available information. Low levels of past dues, NPAs, and year-over-year quantitative historical loss rates continue to demonstrate improvement. The\n            Company will continue to monitor the loan portfolio, levels of nonperforming assets, and the sustainability of improving asset quality trends experienced in 2021 closely and make changes to the allowance for loan losses when necessary. As the\n            economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, elevated levels of risk within the loan portfolio may require additional increases in the ALLL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe allowance for loan losses represents an amount that, in management\u2019s judgement, will be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio.\u00a0 The provision for loan losses\n          increase the allowance and loans charged-off, net of recoveries, reduce the allowance.\u00a0 The following table presents

   2020. Demand deposit and money market account categories had the largest increases, totaling $66.1 million and $65.0 million, respectively. Average time deposits, which is the Company\u2019s most expensive deposit category, decreased by a total of\n          $29.5 million as seen in the table above. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits by the Company in 2021 was 0.39% compared to 0.66% in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe impact of government stimulus, PPP loan related deposits, and higher levels of consumer savings were primary drivers of the increase in total deposits. The Company remains focused on\n          increasing lower-cost deposits by actively targeting new noninterest-bearing deposits and savings deposits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the estimated amounts of total uninsured deposits were $271.7 million and $209.5 million, respectively.\u00a0 The following table shows maturities of the estimated\n          amounts of uninsured time deposits at December 31, 2021.\u00a0 The estimate of uninsured deposits generally represents the portion of deposit accounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000 and is calculated based on the same methodologies\n          and assumptions used for purposes of the Bank\u2019s regulatory reporting requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 11: MATURITIES OF UNINSURED TIME DEPOSITS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAs of December 31,\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(dollars in thousands)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaturing in:\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin 3 months\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17,994\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15,916\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 through 6 months\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2,330\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2,934\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 through 12 months\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n9,476\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n6,348\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreater than 12 months\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n10,123\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n19,177\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n39,923\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n44,375\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapital Resources\n\n\nTotal stockholders' equity as of December 31, 2021 was $120.8 million, up 3.1% from $117.1 million on December 31, 2020 as \nthe result of increased retained earnings\n          partially offset by net unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheets. The change in the unrealized gain/loss position was driven by changes in market\n          rates and shift in portfolio composition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe assessment of capital adequacy depends on such factors as asset quality, liquidity, earnings performance, and changing competitive conditions and economic forces. The adequacy of the\n          Company\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s capital is regularly reviewed. The Company targets regulatory capital levels that will assure an adequate level of capital to support anticipated asset growth and to absorb potential losses. While the Company will\n          continue to look for opportunities to invest capital in profitable growth, the Company will also consider investing capital in other transactions, such as share repurchases, that facilitate improving shareholder return, as measured by ROE and\n          earnings per share.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bank\u2019s capital position remains strong as evidenced by the regulatory capital measurements. Under the banking regulations, Total Capital is composed of core capital (Tier 1) and supplemental capital (Tier 2).\n          Tier 1 capital consists of common stockholders' equity less goodwill. Tier 2 capital consists of certain qualifying debt and a qualifying portion of the allowance for loan losses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn June 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted the Basel III Capital Rules (i) to implement the Basel III capital framework and (ii) for calculating risk-weighted\n            assets. These rules became effective January 1, 2015, subject to limited phase-in periods. The EGRRCPA, enacted in May 2018, \nrequired action by the FRB to expand the applicability of its Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement,\n          which, among other things, exempts certain bank holding companies from reporting consolidated regulatory capital ratios and from minimum regulatory capital requirements that apply to other bank holding companies. In August 2018, the FRB issued an\n          interim final rule provisionally expanding the applicability of the small bank holding company policy statement to bank holding companies with consolidated total assets of less than $3 billion.\u00a0 The statement previously applied only to bank\n          holding companies with consolidated total assets of less than $1 billion. As a result of the interim final rule, which was effective upon its issuance, the Company expects that it will be treated as a small bank holding company and will not be\n          subject to regulatory capital requirements.\u00a0 \nFor an overview of the Basel III Capital Rules and the EGRRCPA, refer to \u201cRegulation and Supervision\u201d included in Item 1, \u201cBusiness\u201d of this report on Form 10-K.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn September 17, 2019 the FDIC finalized a rule that introduces an optional simplified measure of capital adequacy for qualifying community banking organizations (i.e., the community bank\n          leverage ratio (CBLR) framework), as required by the EGRRCPA. The CBLR framework is designed to reduce burden by removing the requirements for calculating and reporting risk-based capital ratios for qualifying community banking organizations that\n          opt into the framework.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to qualify for the CBLR framework, a community banking organization must have a Tier 1 leverage ratio of greater than 9%, less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, and\n          limited amounts of off-balance-sheet exposures and trading assets and liabilities. A qualifying community banking organization that opts into the CBLR framework and meets all requirements under the framework will be considered to have met the\n          well-capitalized ratio requirements under the Prompt Corrective Action regulations and will not be required to report or calculate risk-based capital. The CBLR framework was available for banks to begin using in their March 31, 2020, Call Report.\n          The Bank did not opt into the CBLR framework.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the Bank\u2019s capital ratios for the past two years. As shown below, these ratios were all well above the recommended regulatory minimum levels.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nTABLE 12: REGULATORY CAPITAL\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n 2021\n\n\nRegulatory\n\n\nMinimums\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n                \nDecember 31, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n 2020\n\n\nRegulatory\n\n\nMinimums\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n                \nDecember 31, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n4.500\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n12.57\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n4.500\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n11.69\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTier 1 Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n6.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n12.57\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n6.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n11.69\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTier 1 Leverage to Average Assets\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n4.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n9.09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n4.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n8.56\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n8.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n13.61\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n8.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n12.77\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapital Conservation Buffer\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2.500\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n5.61\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2.500\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n4.77\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk-Weighted Assets (in thousands)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n952,218\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n890,091\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn July 14, 2021, the Company issued $30.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.50% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2031 (the Notes) \nin a private\n          placement transaction.\u00a0 The Notes initially bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.50% for five years and convert to three month SOFR plus 286 basis points, resetting quarterly, thereafter.\u00a0 The Notes were structured to qualify as Tier 2 capital for\n          regulatory purposes and are included in the Company\u2019s Tier 2 capital as of December 31, 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffective October 19, 2021, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program. The Company is authorized pursuant to this program to repurchase up to 10% of the Company\u2019s\n          issued and outstanding common stock through November 30, 2022. Repurchases under the program may be made through privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions, including pursuant to a trading plan in accordance with Rule 10b5-1\n          and/or Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and shares repurchased will be returned to the status of authorized and unissued shares of common stock. The timing, number and purchase price of shares repurchased under\n          the program, if any, will be determined by management in its discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of the shares as a percentage of tangible book value, general market and economic conditions, applicable\n          legal requirements and other conditions, and there is no assurance that the Company will purchase any shares under the program. The Company repurchased 6,600 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at an aggregate cost of $150,000 under this plan\n          during 2021. During the first quarter of 2022, approximately 111,000 shares were repurchased by the Company under this plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear-end book value per share was $23.06 in 2021 and $22.42 in 2020. The common stock of the Company has not been extensively traded. The stock is quoted on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the\n          symbol \u201cOPOF.\u201d There were 1,568 stockholders of record of the Company as of March 15, 2022. This stockholder count does not include stockholders who hold their stock in a nominee registration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiquidity\n\n\nLiquidity is the ability of the Company to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through\n          liability management. Liquid assets include cash, interest-bearing deposits with banks, federal funds sold, investments in securities and loans maturing within one year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s major source of liquidity is its large, stable deposit base. In addition, secondary liquidity sources are available through the use of borrowed funds if the need should arise,\n          including secured advances from the FHLB and FRB. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $391.3 million in FHLB borrowing availability. The Company believes that the availability at the FHLB is sufficient to meet future cash-flow needs. As of\n          year-end 2021 and 2020, the Company had $115.0 million and $100.0 million available in federal funds lines of credit to address any short-term borrowing needs, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result of the Company\u2019s management of liquid assets, the availability of borrowed funds and the ability to generate liquidity through liability funding, management believes that the\n          Company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositors\u2019 requirements and to meet its customers\u2019 future borrowing needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain sufficient liquidity may be affected by numerous factors, including economic conditions nationally and in the Company\u2019s markets.\n          Depending on its liquidity levels, its capital position, conditions in the capital markets and other factors, the Company may from time to time consider the issuance of debt, equity, other securities or other possible capital markets\n          transactions, the proceeds of which could provide additional liquidity for the Company\u2019s operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following table sets forth information relating to the Company\u2019s sources of liquidity and the outstanding commitments for use of liquidity at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\n          Dividing the total short-term sources of liquidity by the outstanding commitments for use of liquidity derives the liquidity coverage ratio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 13:

increase in the securities portfolio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement is not aware of any market or institutional trends, events or uncertainties, other than potential impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, that are expected to have a material effect on\n          the liquidity, capital resources or operations of the Company. Nor is management aware of any current recommendations by regulatory authorities that would have a material effect on liquidity or operations. The Company\u2019s internal sources of\n          liquidity are deposits, loan and investment repayments and securities available-for-sale. The Company\u2019s primary external source of liquidity is advances from the FHLB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s operating activities provided $23.2 million of cash during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $8.6\n            million used during 2020.\u00a0 The Company\u2019s investing activities used $60.7 million of cash during 2021, compared to $122.2 million of cash used during 2020. The Company\u2019s financing activities provided $105.0 million of cash during 2021 compared\n            to $161.4 million of cash provided during 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into contractual obligations and has made other commitments to make future payments. For further information concerning the Company\u2019s\n          expected timing of such payments as of December 31, 2021, refer to Note 7, Leases, Note 10, Borrowings, and Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. \u201cFinancial Statements and\n          Supplementary Data\u201d of this report on Form 10-K.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\n\nTo meet the financing needs of customers, the Company is a party, in the normal course of business, to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk. These financial instruments include\n          commitments to extend credit, commitments to sell loans and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in addition to the amount on the balance sheet. The Company\u2019s exposure to credit loss in\n          the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit written is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments. The same credit policies are used in\n          making these commitments and conditional obligations as used for on-balance-sheet instruments. Collateral is obtained based on the credit assessment of the customer in each circumstance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoan commitments are agreements to extend credit to a customer provided that there are no violations of the terms of the contract prior to funding. Commitments have fixed expiration dates or\n          other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee by the customer. Since many of the commitments may expire without being completely drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The\n          total amount of unused loan commitments at the Bank was $167.1 million at December 31, 2021, and $151.6 million at December 31, 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of\n          credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. The total contract amount of standby letters of credit was $3.6 million at December 31, 2021 and $4.8 million at December 31, 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement believes that the Company has the liquidity and capital resources to handle these commitments in the normal course of business. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial\n          Statements included in Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report on Form 10-K.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\n\nRecent accounting pronouncements affecting the Corporation are described in Item 8. \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d under the heading \u201cNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting\n          Policies-Recent Significant Accounting Pronouncements.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\n\nIn reporting the results of the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company has provided supplemental financial measures on a tax-equivalent or an adjusted basis. These non-GAAP financial\n          measures are a supplement to GAAP, which is used to prepare the Company\u2019s financial statements, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the Company\u2019s\n          non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. The Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures discussed herein in its analysis of the Company\u2019s performance. The Company\u2019s management believes\n          that these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional understanding of ongoing operations and enhance comparability of results of operations with prior periods presented without the impact of items or events that may obscure trends in the\n          Company\u2019s underlying performance.\u00a0 A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company to evaluate and measure the Company\u2019s performance to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is presented below.\n\n\n
