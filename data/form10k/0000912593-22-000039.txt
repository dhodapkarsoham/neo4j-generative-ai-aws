{"item1": ">ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGENERAL OVERVIEW\nSun Communities, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and all wholly-owned or majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries, including Sun Communities Operating Limited Partnership, a Michigan limited partnership (the \"Operating Partnership\"), Sun Home Services, Inc., a Michigan corporation (\"SHS\") and Safe Harbor Marinas, LLC (\"Safe Harbor\") are referred to herein as the \"Company,\" \"us,\" \"we,\" and \"our.\"\nWe are a fully integrated real estate investment trust (\"REIT\"). We own manufactured housing (\"MH\") communities and recreational vehicle (\"RV\") resorts throughout the United States and in Ontario, Canada. We self-administer, self-manage, and operate or hold an interest in, and develop the majority of our MH communities and RV resorts. A select number of our communities and resorts are operated by independent third party contractors on our behalf under a management agreement. Others are operated by a lessee under a ground lease arrangement. Through Safe Harbor, we own, operate, develop and manage marinas throughout the United States (\"U.S.\") and Puerto Rico, with the majority of such marinas concentrated in coastal regions and others located in various inland regions. We are a fully-integrated real estate company which, together with our affiliates and predecessors, has been in the business of acquiring, operating, developing and expanding MH communities and RV resorts since 1975 and marinas since 2020. We lease individual parcels of land, or sites, with utility access for the placement of manufactured homes and RVs to our MH and RV customers. Our MH communities are designed to offer affordable housing to individuals and families, while also providing certain amenities. Our RV resorts are designed to offer affordable vacation opportunities to individuals and families complemented by a diverse selection of high-quality amenities. Our marina offerings include wet slip and dry storage space leases, end-to-end service (such as routine maintenance, repair and winterization), fuel sales and other high-end amenities. These services and amenities offer convenience and resort-quality experiences.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we owned and operated, directly or indirectly, or had an interest in, a portfolio of 602 MH communities, RV resorts and marinas (collectively, the \"properties\") located in 39 states, Ontario, Canada and Puerto Rico, including 284 MH communities, 160 RV resorts, 33 properties containing both MH and RV sites, and 125 marinas. As of December 31, 2021, the properties contained an aggregate of 204,163 developed sites comprised of 98,621 developed MH sites, 30,540 annual RV sites (inclusive of both annual and seasonal usage rights), 29,847 transient RV sites, and 45,155 wet slips and dry storage spaces. Additionally, there are nearly 11,000 additional MH and RV sites suitable for development.\nWe are engaged through SHS, a taxable REIT subsidiary, in the marketing, selling, and leasing of new and pre-owned homes to current and future residents in our communities. The operations of SHS support and enhance our occupancy levels, property performance and cash flows.\nOur executive and principal property management office is located at 27777 Franklin Road, Suite 200, Southfield, Michigan 48034 and our telephone number is (248) 208-2500. Our Safe Harbor marina segment principal office is located in Dallas, Texas. We have regional property management offices throughout the United States. We employed an aggregate of 5,961 full and part time employees as of December 31, 2021.\nOur website address is www.suncommunities.com and we make available, free of charge, on or through our website all of our periodic reports, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). Additionally, the SEC maintains a website at https://www.sec.gov, that contains reports, proxy information statements and other information about Sun.\n1\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nSTRUCTURE OF THE COMPANY\nThe Operating Partnership is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT. We conduct substantially all of our operations through the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership owns, either directly or indirectly through other subsidiaries, substantially all of our assets. This UPREIT structure enables us to comply with certain complex requirements under the federal tax rules and regulations applicable to REITs, and to acquire MH communities, RV resorts and marinas in transactions that defer some or all of the sellers' tax consequences. The financial results of the Operating Partnership and our other subsidiaries are consolidated in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The financial results include certain activities that do not necessarily qualify as REIT activities under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"). We have formed taxable REIT subsidiaries, as defined in the Code, to engage in such activities. We use taxable REIT subsidiaries to offer certain services to our residents and engage in activities that would not otherwise be permitted under the REIT rules if provided directly by us or by the Operating Partnership. The taxable REIT subsidiaries include our home sales business, SHS, which provides manufactured home sales, leasing, and other services to current and prospective tenants of our properties.\nUnder the partnership agreement, the Operating Partnership is structured to make distributions with respect to certain of the Operating Partnership units (\"OP units\") at the same time that distributions are made to our common stockholders. The Operating Partnership is structured to permit limited partners holding certain classes or series of OP units to exchange those OP units for shares of our common stock (in a taxable transaction) and achieve liquidity for their investment.\nAs the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, we generally have the power to manage and have complete control over the conduct of the Operating Partnership's affairs and all decisions or actions made or taken by us as the general partner pursuant to the partnership agreement are generally binding upon all of the partners and the Operating Partnership.\n2\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nWe do not own all of the OP units. \nThe following table sets forth:\n\u2022\nThe various series of OP units and the number of units of each series outstanding as of December 31, 2021;\n\u2022\nThe relative ranking of the various series of OP units with respect to rights to the payment of distributions and the distribution of assets in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Operating Partnership;\n\u2022\nThe number of shares of our common stock issuable upon the exchange of each OP unit of the applicable series;\n\u2022\nThe annual distribution rate on each series of OP Units; and\n\u2022\nInformation regarding the terms of redemption rights for each series of OP units, as applicable.\nRanking\nDescription\nOP Units Outstanding at December 31, 2021\nExchange Rate\n(1)\nAnnual Distribution Rate\n(2)\nCash Redemption\n(3)\nRedemption Period\n1\nPreferred OP units (or \"Aspen preferred OP units\")\n1,283,819\n(4)\nVariable\n(5)\nVariable\n(6)\nMandatory\nVariable\n(7)\n1\nSeries A-1 preferred OP units\n275,024\u00a0\n2.439\n6.0\u00a0\n%\nN/A\nN/A\n2\nSeries C preferred OP units\n306,163\u00a0\n1.11\nVariable\n(8)\nN/A\nN/A\n3\nSeries D preferred OP units\n488,958\u00a0\n0.8\nVariable\n(9)\nHolder's Option\nAny time after earlier of January 31, 2024 or death of holder\n4\nSeries E preferred OP units\n90,000\u00a0\n0.6897\nVariable\n(10)\nN/A\nN/A\n5\nSeries F preferred OP units\n90,000\u00a0\n0.625\n3.0\u00a0\n%\nHolder's Option\nAny time after earlier of May 14, 2025 or death of holder\n6\nSeries G preferred OP units\n240,710\u00a0\n0.6452\n3.2\u00a0\n%\nHolder's Option\nAny time after earlier of September 30, 2025 or death of holder\n7\nSeries H preferred OP units\n581,407\u00a0\n0.6098\n3.0\u00a0\n%\nHolder's Option\nAny time after earlier of October 30, 2025 or death of holder\n8\nSeries I preferred OP units\n922,000\u00a0\n0.6098\n3.0\u00a0\n%\nHolder's Option\nAny time after earlier of December 31, 2025 or death of holder\n9\nSeries J preferred OP units\n240,000\u00a0\n0.6061\n2.85\u00a0\n%\nHolder's Option\nDuring the 30-day period following a change of control of the Company or any time after April 21, 2026.\n10\nSeries A-3 preferred OP units\n40,268\u00a0\n1.8605\n4.5\u00a0\n%\nN/A\nN/A\n11\nCommon OP units\n118,514,363\n(11)\n1.0\nSame distribution rate for common stock and common OP units\nN/A\nN/A\n(1)\n Exchange rates are subject to adjustment upon stock splits, recapitalizations and similar events. The exchange rates of certain series of OP units are approximated to four decimal places.\n(2)\n Except for common OP units, distributions are payable on the issue price of each OP unit, which is $27.00 per unit for all Aspen preferred OP units and $100.00 per unit for all other preferred OP units.\n(3)\n The redemption price for each OP unit redeemed will be equal to its issue price plus all accrued but unpaid distributions.\n(4) \nOf the outstanding Aspen preferred OP units, 270,000 are designated as \"Aspen 2034 Units.\"\n(5)\n At any time prior to January 1, 2024 (or prior to January 1, 2034 with respect to the Aspen 2034 Units), at the holder's option, each Aspen preferred OP unit may be exchanged into: (a) if the average closing price of our common stock for the preceding ten trading days is $68.00 per share or less, 0.397 common OP units, or (b) if the average closing price of our common stock for the preceding ten trading days is greater than $68.00 per share, the number of common OP units determined by dividing (i) the sum of (A) $27.00 plus (B) 25 percent of the amount by which the average closing price of our common stock for the preceding ten trading days exceeds $68.00 per share, by (ii) the average closing price of our common stock for the preceding ten trading days.\n(6)\n The annual distribution rate for Aspen 2034 Units is 3.8 percent. The annual distribution rate on all other Aspen preferred OP units is equal to the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield plus 239 basis points; provided, however, that such aggregate distribution rate shall not be less than 6.5 percent nor more than 9.0 percent.\n(7) \nWe are required to redeem all outstanding Aspen preferred OP units other than the Aspen 2034 Units on January 2, 2024. We are required to redeem all outstanding Aspen 2034 Units on January 2, 2034. In addition, we are required to redeem the Aspen preferred OP units (including Aspen 2034 Units) of any holder thereof within five days after receipt of a written demand during the existence of certain uncured Aspen preferred OP unit defaults, including our failure to pay distributions on the Aspen preferred OP units when due and our failure to provide certain security for the payment of distributions on the Aspen preferred OP units.\n(8)\n 4.5 percent until April 1, 2020 and 5.0 percent thereafter.\n(9) \n3.75 percent until January 31, 2021 and 4.0 percent thereafter.\n(10)\n 5.25 percent until January 9, 2022 and 5.5 percent thereafter.\n(11)\n Of the 118,514,363 common OP units, 115,976,408, or 97.9 percent were held by us, and 2,537,955, or 2.1 percent were owned by the limited partners.\n3\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nREAL PROPERTY OPERATIONS\nMH communities and RV resorts\nAn MH community is a residential subdivision with sites for the placement of manufactured homes, related improvements and amenities. Manufactured homes are detached single\u2011family homes which are produced off\u2011site by manufacturers and installed on site within the community. Manufactured homes are available in a wide array of designs, providing owners with a level of customization generally unavailable in multi-family housing developments. Modern MH communities contain improvements similar to other garden\u2011style residential developments, including centralized entrances, paved streets, curbs, gutters and parkways. In addition, these communities also often provide a number of amenities, such as a clubhouse, a swimming pool, basketball courts, shuffleboard courts, tennis courts and laundry facilities.\nAn RV resort is a resort with sites for the placement of RVs for varied lengths of time. RV resorts may also provide vacation rental homes and may include a number of amenities such as restaurants, golf courses, swimming pools, water parks, tennis courts, fitness centers, planned activities and spacious social facilities.\nRenters at our MH and RV properties lease the site on which a manufactured home, RV or vacation rental home is located. We typically own the underlying land, utility connections, streets, lighting, driveways, common area amenities, and other capital improvements and are responsible for enforcement of community guidelines and maintenance. In certain MH and RV properties, we do not own all of the underlying land and operate the communities pursuant to ground leases. Certain of the properties provide water and sewer service through public or private utilities companies, while others provide these services to residents from on-site facilities. Each owner of a home within our properties is responsible for the maintenance of the home and leased site. As a result, our capital expenditure needs tend to be less significant relative to multi-family rental apartment complexes.\nIn 2021, we began to rebrand certain of our RV resorts under the \"Sun Outdoors\" umbrella. Sun Outdoors offers tent camping, RV sites and vacation rentals with world-class amenities throughout the U.S. and in Ontario, Canada. We believe this rebranding under the Sun Outdoors umbrella will allow us to gain a competitive advantage in the outdoor recreation market. We are in the process of implementing the Sun Outdoors brand at certain of our RV resorts and expect implementation to be substantially completed by the end of 2022. Implementation consists of conversion of digital presence (Website, Facebook, Rezplot reservation software and other internal systems) and signage replacement at the resorts.\nWe compete with other available MH communities and RV resorts, and alternative forms of housing (such as on-site constructed homes, apartments, condominiums and townhouses) as they provide housing alternatives to potential tenants of MH communities and RV resorts.\nMarina\nA marina is a specially-designed harbor that can be located on oceans, lakes, bays or rivers and typically includes dry storage systems that provide storage solutions for the placement of vessels ranging in size from small boats to super yachts for varied lengths of time. Dry storage systems also allow for the required maintenance to the vessels that we store. Marinas also provide ancillary services, such as fuel stations, ship stores, restaurants, swimming pools, cabin and lodging rentals, boat rentals, tennis courts, fitness centers, shower and laundry facilities, planned activities and other services to create a robust member experience.\nRenters at our marinas lease the wet slip or dry storage space on which the vessel is stored. We typically own the underlying land, building improvements, dock improvements, site improvements and other on-site amenity structures. Because we own the facilities and improvements on the land or submerged land at those marinas, we are responsible for the capital improvements and maintenance. In certain marinas, we do not own all of the underlying land and operate the marinas pursuant to ground leases.\nWe compete with other available marinas in the U.S. and Puerto Rico.\nPROPERTY MANAGEMENT\nOur property management strategy emphasizes intensive, detail-oriented, hands-on management by dedicated, on-site community, resort and marina managers. We believe our focus on creating an exceptional resident, guest and member experience creates a competitive advantage. It enables us to continually monitor and address concerns, the performance of competitive properties and local market conditions. As of December 31, 2021, of our 5,961 employees, 4,145 were located on-site as property managers, support staff or maintenance personnel, and of those, approximately 83.0 percent were full-time employees.\n4\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nOur MH and RV property managers are overseen by John B. McLaren, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who has been in the MH industry since 1995, Bruce Thelen, our Executive Vice President of Operations and Sales, who has led our manufactured home sales and leasing subsidiary, SHS, since January 2018, three Senior Vice Presidents of Operations and Sales, 11 Divisional Vice Presidents and 45 Regional Vice Presidents. Each Regional Vice President oversees one to 16 properties and is responsible for regular property inspections, oversight of property operations and sales functions, semi-annual market surveys of competitive communities and interaction with local manufactured home dealers.\nEach property manager performs regular inspections in order to monitor the physical condition of properties and to effectively address tenant concerns. In addition to an on-site manager, each district or property has on-site maintenance personnel and management support staff. We hold mandatory training sessions for all new property management personnel to ensure that policies and procedures are executed effectively and professionally. All of our property management personnel participate in on-going training to ensure that changes to policies and procedures are implemented consistently. Our internal training program has led to increased knowledge and accountability for daily operations and policies and procedures.\nOur marina business is overseen by Baxter Underwood, the Chief Executive Officer of Safe Harbor, who has been in the marina business since 2006, two Chief Operating Officers and 17 Regional Vice Presidents who are responsible for regular marina inspections and oversight of operations.\nHOME SALES AND RENTALS\nSHS is engaged in the marketing, selling and leasing of new and pre-owned homes to residents in our communities. Because tenants often purchase a home already on-site within a community, such services enhance occupancy and property performance. Additionally, because many of the homes on the properties are sold through SHS, better control of home quality in our communities can be maintained than if sales services were conducted solely through third-party brokers.\nSHS also leases homes to prospective tenants. At December 31, 2021, SHS had 9,870 occupied leased homes in its portfolio. New and pre-owned homes are purchased for the Rental Program. Leases associated with the Rental Program generally have a term of one year. The Rental Program requires management of costs associated with repair and refurbishment of these homes as the tenants vacate and the homes are re-leased, similar to apartment rentals. We received approximately 55,500 applications during 2021 to live in our MH and RV properties, providing a significant \"resident onboarding\" system that allows us to market the purchase of a home to qualified applicants. Through the Rental Program we demonstrate our product and lifestyle to the renters, while monitoring their payment history and converting qualified renters to owners.\nOur home sales and leasing operations compete with other local and national MH dealers and MH community owners.\nMARINA MEMBER BASE\nWe are engaged in the marketing and leasing of wet slips and dry storage spaces and have approximately 45,000 members throughout our marina network as of December 31, 2021.\nSITE LEASES OR USAGE RIGHTS\nTypical tenant leases for MH sites are year-to-year or month-to-month, renewable upon the consent of both parties, or, in some instances, as provided by statute. Certain of our leases, mainly at our Florida and California properties, are tied to the consumer price index or other indices as they relate to rent increases. Generally, market rate adjustments are made on an annual basis. These leases are cancellable for non-payment of rent, violation of community rules and regulations or other specified defaults. During the five calendar years ended December 31, 2021, on average less than 1.0 percent of the homes in our MH communities have been removed by their owners and 6.5 percent of the homes have been sold by their owners to a new owner who then assumes rental obligations as a community resident. The average cost to move a home is approximately $7,000.\u00a0On average, our residents remain in our communities for approximately 14 years.\nTypical resident agreements for RV sites are year-to-year or from move-in date until the end of the current calendar year. Generally, increases and market rate adjustments are made on an annual basis. These agreements are cancellable for non-payment of rent, violation of resort rules and regulations or other specified defaults.\nLeases for wet slips and dry storage spaces at our marinas are year-to-year, season-to-season, month-to-month, or transient by night, renewable upon the consent of both parties. On average, our members maintain leases in our marinas for approximately eight years.\n5\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nACQUISITIONS\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we acquired 35 MH communities and RV resorts, totaling 9,277 sites and 19 marinas totaling 6,539 wet slips and dry storage spaces for a total purchase price of approximately $1.4\u00a0billion.\nOn November 13, 2021, we entered into an agreement to acquire Tiger Topco 1 Limited (together with its subsidiaries, \"Park Holidays\"), an owner and operator of holiday communities in the United Kingdom. The transaction values Park Holidays at an enterprise value of \u00a3950 million (or approximately $1.3 billion). We anticipate that the acquisition of Park Holidays will close within the three months ending March 31, 2022. However, the closing is subject to the approval of the UK Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates certain loan brokering activities of Park Holidays.\nWe are also currently pursuing additional significant acquisition opportunities outside the United States, including in the United Kingdom and Europe.\nEXPANSION / DEVELOPMENT\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed the construction of over 1,030 sites in eight ground-up developments and re-developments, and nearly 580 expansion sites in six MH communities and five RV resorts.\nREGULATIONS AND INSURANCE\nGeneral\nMH, RV and marina properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to recreational facilities such as swimming pools, clubhouses and other common areas. Each property has the necessary operating permits and approvals.\nInsurance\nOur management believes that the properties are covered by adequate fire, property, business interruption, general liability, and (where appropriate) flood and earthquake insurance provided by reputable companies with commercially reasonable deductibles and limits. We maintain a blanket policy that covers all of our properties. We have obtained title insurance insuring fee title to the properties in an aggregate amount which we believe to be adequate. Claims made to our insurance carriers that are determined to be recoverable are classified in other receivables as incurred.\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nHuman capital management is key to our success and focuses on diversity, equity and inclusion, employee retention and talent development practices. We are committed to building an equitable and inclusive culture that inspires and supports the growth of our employees, serves our communities and shapes a more sustainable business. The most significant measures and objectives that we focus on in managing our business and our related human capital initiatives include the following:\nCULTURE \nWe are taking deliberate actions to foster a growth culture that is grounded in our vision and culture statements: We are an inspired, engaged and collaborative team committed to providing extraordinary service to our residents, customers and team members. Together as one team, we embrace the following seven key behaviors that make our company a great place to work:\n\u2022\nLive the Golden Rule: Treat others the way you want to be treated;\n\u2022\nDo the right thing;\n\u2022\nWe over me;\n\u2022\nNothing changes if nothing changes;\n\u2022\nMindset is everything;\n\u2022\nKeep it simple; and\n\u2022\nBe yourself and thrive.\n6\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nLEADERSHIP, TALENT, TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT\nWe expect our leaders to be role models and lead in a way that enables our organization to achieve success. Our strategy is anchored in promoting the right internal talent and hiring the right external talent for career opportunities across our organization. We are focused on hiring and developing talent that mirrors the markets we serve, and investing in learning opportunities and capabilities that equip our workforce with the skills they need while improving engagement and retention.\n\u2022\nOur internal training program, Sun University, offers over 100 courses to our MH and RV team members on a range of topics, including leadership, communications, inclusion and diversity, software and operations. Our internal training program has led to increased knowledge and accountability for daily operations and policies and procedures. In 2021, team members logged 52,506 learning hours;\n\u2022\nWe hold mandatory ongoing training sessions for all property management personnel to ensure that policies and procedures are executed effectively, professionally and consistently; and\n\u2022\nNew team members are required to complete information security training, and safety and compliance-related training, with routine refreshers at least annually on critical topics.\nWe are dedicated to the attraction, development and retention of our talent, focusing our efforts on ensuring that the returning seasonal team member pipeline remains robust each year and our annual talent management processes focus on the professional development of salaried team members. As of December 31, 2021, nearly 10 percent of our employees had over 10 years tenure.\nOur compensation philosophy, aimed to apply merit-based, equitable compensation practices, is designed to attract and retain top talent. For eligible team members, we offer competitive salary, health, welfare, retirement and pet insurance benefits, tuition reimbursement and rent / vacation discounts at our properties.\nDIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION (\"DEI\")\nWe make it a priority to recognize and appreciate the diverse characteristics that make individuals unique in an atmosphere that promotes and celebrates individual and collective achievement. We believe it's not just about gender or race, but about being diverse in thoughts, life and work experiences. Our inclusive environment challenges, inspires, rewards, and transforms our team to be the best. We do not tolerate harassing, discriminatory, or retaliatory conduct as such conduct is prohibited and inconsistent with our policies, practices and philosophy. We continue to put our resources and energy into strategies and initiatives to create a more equitable environment.\nWorkforce Diversity\nWe believe we are a stronger organization when our workforce represents a diversity of ideas and experiences. We value and embrace diversity in our employee recruiting, hiring and development practices. As of December 31, 2021, 41 percent of our employees were female, 21 percent of our employees were racially or ethnically diverse, and 47 percent of our employees were aged 50 years and older, with approximately 24 percent being aged 60 years and older.\nTraining and Resources\nWe offer trainings and resources on diversity, equity and inclusion to our employees. Diversity education and training programs for our team focus on unconscious bias, gender identity and transitions, generational differences, religion in the workplace, and self-awareness and self-assessments.\n\u2022\nWe launched our formal initiative for Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Accountability (\"IDEA\") focused on enhancing diversity through education, awareness and outreach throughout our company, communities and resorts;\n\u2022\nWe engaged a third-party DEI consultant who conducted a company-wide training on DEI-related key foundational terms and helped develop an organization-wide IDEA strategy for Sun; and\n\u2022\nWe set the foundation with senior leaders at our 2021 Elevate conference where we held break out sessions on allyship with inclusion and belonging, continuing the IDEA conversation, inclusive leadership, introduction to IDEA, and workplace microaggressions and unconscious bias.\n7\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nIn order to implement and sustain this initiative, in 2021:\n\u2022\nWe created our IDEA council to help implement Sun's IDEA Strategy;\n\u2022\nOur Chief Executive Officer signed a pledge for the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion, a commitment to advance diversity and inclusion within the workplace;\n\u2022\nWe made Juneteenth an annual company holiday to celebrate the end of slavery in the United States;\n\u2022\nWe launched an anti-racism resource center for employees inclusive of videos, podcasts, articles, books, films and television series; and\n\u2022\nWe implemented \"Job Analyzer\" in our applicant tracking system to proactively identify and address gender bias in job postings.\nEQUITY PAY\nWe are committed to providing a total compensation package that is market-based, performance driven, fair and internally equitable. Our goal is to be competitive both within the general employment market as well as with our competitors in the real estate industry, with our strongest performers being paid more.\n\u2022\nCompensation for each position is determined by utilizing reliable third-party compensation surveys to obtain current market data. Additionally, position descriptions and compensation are routinely reviewed for market competitiveness.\n\u2022\nOn an annual basis, the performance of all team members is evaluated and merit increases are allocated based on performance. This process ensures equitable performance review and corresponding pay practices that attract, retain, and reward top talent.\n\u2022\nIn 2021, we conducted an analysis on data related to open positions, retention, market compensation pay gaps, and internal equity, and remediated any identified pay gaps. A total of 3,300 team members received some level of pay increase apart from their normal merit-based increase.\nBUSINESS INTEGRITY\nOur Code of Conduct and Business Ethics is grounded in our commitment to do the right thing. It serves as the foundation of our approach to ethics and compliance, and our anti-corruption compliance program is focused on conducting business in a fair, ethical and legal manner.\nWORKPLACE HEALTH AND SAFETY\nSun actively seeks opportunities to minimize health, safety and environmental risks to our team members, residents, and guests we serve in our communities and resorts by utilizing safe operating procedures and practices:\n\u2022\nAs part of our commitment to safety, Sun oversees annual safety training programs for all employees to provide tools and safeguards for accident prevention. Our managers are responsible for ensuring that team members receive the appropriate training to perform their jobs safely;\n\u2022\nAll team members participate in safety training during the onboarding process, and thereafter, team members in the field complete an annual safety training course;\n\u2022\nWe work hard to uphold a safe workplace by complying with safety and health laws and regulations, maintaining internal requirements and remediating risks. Each community is regularly inspected to ensure safety standards are being met, with comprehensive safety inspections completed annually; and\n\u2022\nOur COVID-19 Response and Action Plan, described below, continues to serve as a guideline for the safe operation of our communities, resorts and main office.\n8\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (\"ESG\")\nWe uphold a company-wide commitment to ESG goals through various programs and everyday business practices. We are fully committed to reducing our environmental impact across the scope of our operations and through the services we deliver to our residents and guests. We continue to identify opportunities to invest in energy-efficient technology, water efficiency and waste reduction strategies throughout our communities, resorts and corporate headquarters. By conserving natural resources, reducing our carbon footprint and participating in efforts to protect the environment through our Sun Unity program, we are striving to achieve our environmental sustainability goals.\nWe recognize the important opportunity of providing access to affordable and sustainable housing. Our business contributes to a vitally important function in our economy by providing high-quality, yet affordable, housing for both all-age and age-restricted needs. Manufactured homes cost approximately 52 percent less per square foot than conventional site-built homes, expanding the opportunity for residents to own their home, despite an ever-increasing housing affordability gap. Our homes provide more space at less cost per square foot compared to other options.\nAs a nationwide provider of affordable housing, and a leader in the marina business, we believe we have a responsibility not only to our residents, guests and team members, but also to the communities in which we live and work. These social responsibility efforts are initiated through our Sun Unity program, so we can join together as a team and give back to these communities to achieve goals like promotion, education and waste reduction.\nCOVID-19 RELIEF AND SUPPORT\nThe health and safety of our residents, guests and team members is our top priority. In 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, we instituted our COVID-19 Response and Action Plan which established guidelines for safe operations of our communities, resorts and our main office. We continue to revise our guidelines to be in line with revised government and regulatory mandates. Content contained within this plan includes:\n\u2022\nMethods for preventing and reducing exposure and transmission of COVID-19 among individuals;\n\u2022\nMethods for identification and isolation of sick persons;\n\u2022\nOperational protocols for social distancing, including reduced occupancy requirements;\n\u2022\nSanitation policies and procedures, including cleaning, disinfecting and decontamination;\n\u2022\nCommunications and training for team members and leaders that are necessary to implement the plan; and\n\u2022\nProcedures to ensure effective ongoing implementation of the plan.\nTemporary relief measures extended to residents and guests include:\n\u2022\nEnhanced cleaning procedures, as well as additional signage, and changes to policies and procedures further promoting social distancing.\n\u2022\nAmenity kits are being provided to guests upon check-in which include hand sanitizer, face masks and sanitation wipes.\n\u2022\nContactless processes are put in place for rent collection, lease renewals, reservations and guest check-ins.\n\u2022\nLarge quantities of personal protection equipment and cleaning products are distributed to all of Sun's locations.\nWhile COVID-19 had a material effect on our employees, residents and guests during 2021, it did not materially impact our financial performance.\n9\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nCOMMITMENT TO A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE\nWhile the pandemic has been the defining issue of the last two years, climate change is the challenge of our lifetime. Climate change poses a clear threat and challenge to the real estate sector, as buildings contribute up to 30 percent of global annual greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions. Climate change impacts are material to our overall value as well as our ability to serve our residents, guests, employees, investors and other stakeholders. We are committed to reducing our GHG emissions and working to improve upon the environmental performance of the communities and properties within our portfolio. We are at the very beginning of this process with a focus on expanding our climate analysis to be more comprehensive and integrated into our overall business strategy. Some of our accomplishments include:\nClimate Risk Assessment \n- In 2021, we performed an analysis of the climate risk impact on our properties. Various models were used to determine risks related to the sea-level rise, flooding, wildfire, water scarcity, cold waves and heat waves across three timeframes (2020, 2030 and 2050). We reviewed the results of this assessment and are using them to develop our risk mitigation and resilience (climate change adaptation) strategies. We are now integrating a climate risk analysis in the due diligence process during acquisitions of properties.\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions \n- We created a framework to track the GHG emissions across our portfolio. We are implementing GHG emissions-reduction strategies where feasible to reduce emissions and their negative impact on climate change. The framework allows us to track, monitor and evaluate current performance, and make adjustments to our GHG emissions-reduction strategies.\nPlease see the Risk Factors in Item 1A, and our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more detailed information.\n10\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains various \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), and we intend that such forward-looking statements will be subject to the safe harbors created thereby.

This summary does not contain all of the information that may be important to you, and you should read the more detailed discussion of risks that follows this summary.\nSUMMARY OF RISK FACTORS\nMATERIAL RISKS RELATING TO OUR MH, RV AND MARINA BUSINESSES\n\u2022\nThe geographic concentration of our properties in specific regions exposes us to the risks of downturns in local economies or other local real estate market conditions;\n\u2022\nWe build and develop new MH communities, RV resorts and marinas and expand our existing properties, which exposes us to risks relating to zoning and permit laws, construction delays, unexpected development costs and fluctuations in occupancy rates at our newly developed properties;\n\u2022\nThe industries in which we operate are highly-fragmented and we are subject to competition with national and regional players that may have greater resources than us;\n\u2022\nThe cyclical and seasonal nature of the RV and marina industries lead to fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nOur continued growth is subject to our ability to successfully integrate and finance our acquisitions on favorable terms.\n\u2022\nThe successful operation of our marinas depends on our ability to retain key employees with experience in the marina business, including Baxter R. Underwood, who is the Chief Executive Officer of Safe Harbor;\n\u2022\nMany of our properties are in areas that experience extreme weather conditions like floods, hurricanes, wildfires, sea-level rises or earthquakes and climate change could exacerbate these weather conditions;\n\u2022\nMarinas are specific-use properties and may contain features or assets that have limited alternative uses;\n\u2022\nMany of our marinas are situated on land controlled by governmental bodies and we must lease this land from them. These governmental authorities may terminate, fail to renew, or interpret in ways unfavorable to us, any of the permits, licenses, leases and approvals necessary for the operation of our marinas;\n\u2022\nOur properties are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and we may incur liability under these environmental laws for remediation and disposal of hazardous materials located on our properties;\n\u2022\nWe may not complete our previously announced acquisition of Park Holidays and, even if we complete the acquisition, we may not realize the intended benefits of the Park Holidays acquisition;\n\u2022\nWe will be subject to additional legal, regulatory, tax, supply chain, political and economic risks as we continue to expand our international investments;\n\u2022\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and performance in unanticipated ways; and\n\u2022\nState and local rent control laws may inhibit our ability to increase rents to recover increases in our operating expenses.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR DEBT FINANCINGS\n\u2022\nWe have a significant amount of debt which could limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition;\n\u2022\nAny failure to meet our obligations on our secured debt could result in foreclosure on the collateral securing the debt; and\n\u2022\nIncreases in market interest rates could materially increase our costs associated with existing and future debt. We mitigate the risks underlying increases in interest rates through hedging activities, but no hedging activity can protect us completely.\nTAX RISKS RELATED TO OUR STATUS AS A REIT\n\u2022\nIf we fail to qualify as a REIT our taxable income would be subject to federal income tax at a regular corporate rate which would materially and adversely affect our financial condition;\n\u2022\nThe Operating Partnership could be classified as a \"publicly traded partnership\" which would subject it to taxation as a corporation and lead to substantial tax liabilities; and\n\u2022\nCompliance with the complex requirements and tests that are applied to REITs may hinder our ability to operate solely to maximize profits.\n12\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nRISKS RELATED TO RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OUR STRUCTURE\n\u2022\nSome of our directors and officers may have conflicts of interest with respect to certain related party transactions and other business interests;\n\u2022\nOur governing documents prohibit, with limited exceptions, a single stockholder from owning more than 9.8 percent of our capital stock, which may discourage a change of control of the Company; and\n\u2022\nCertain provisions of Maryland law may discourage third parties from conducting a tender offer or otherwise acquiring us via a change of control transaction that could be beneficial to our stockholders.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\n\u2022\nOur share price is subject to fluctuations that could be caused by a wide range of factors that could ultimately lead to a complete loss on our shareholders' investment;\n\u2022\nThe sale or issuance of substantial amounts of our common or preferred stock could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common or preferred stock;\n\u2022\nWe may not generate cash flows in an amount sufficient enough to make distributions on our stock, to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs;\n\u2022\nA failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls may cause our financial reports to become inaccurate which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our operating results;  \n\u2022\nOur, or our third party vendors', networks could become compromised, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen;\n\u2022\nWe may experience losses in excess of our insurance coverages;\n\u2022\nAdverse content about us on social media platforms could result in damage to our reputation or brand; and\n\u2022\nWe may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\n13\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.", "item1a": ">ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur prospects are subject to certain uncertainties and risks. Our future results could differ materially from current results, and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements as a result of certain risk factors. These risk factors include, but are not limited to, those set forth below, other one-time events, and important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in our other filings with the SEC.\nMATERIAL RISKS RELATING TO OUR MH, RV AND MARINA BUSINESSES\nGeneral economic conditions and the concentration of our MH, RV and Marina properties in certain geographic areas may affect our ability to generate sufficient revenue.\nThe market and economic conditions in our current markets generally, and specifically in metropolitan areas of our current markets, may significantly affect occupancy or rental rates. Occupancy and rental rates, in turn, may significantly affect our revenues, and if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, our cash flow and ability to pay or refinance our debt obligations could be adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2021, 152 MH and RV properties, representing 25.5 percent of developed sites, are located in Florida; 90 properties, representing 17.8 percent of developed sites, are located in Michigan; 33 properties, representing 6.3 percent of developed sites, are located in Texas; and 45 properties, representing 6.3 percent of developed sites, are located in California. As of December 31, 2021, we have revenue concentrations of marinas in Florida, Rhode Island and California of approximately 22.6 percent, 8.0 percent and 6.5 percent, respectively. As a result of the geographic concentration of our MH and RV properties in Florida, Michigan, Texas and California, and geographic concentration of our marinas in Florida, Rhode Island and California, we are exposed to the risks of downturns in local economies or other local real estate market conditions which could adversely affect occupancy rates, rental rates and property values in these markets.\nOur revenue would also be adversely affected if tenants were unable to pay rent or if sites were unable to be rented on favorable terms. If we were unable to promptly relet or renew the leases for a significant number of the sites, or if the rental rates upon such renewal or reletting were significantly lower than expected rates, then our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, certain expenditures associated with each property (such as real estate taxes and maintenance costs) generally are not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property. Furthermore, real estate investments are relatively illiquid and, therefore, will tend to limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.\nThe following factors, among others, may adversely affect the revenues generated by our properties:\n\u2022\nOutbreaks of disease, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and related stay-at-home orders, quarantine policies and restrictions on travel, trade and business operations;\n\u2022\nThe national and local economic climate which may be adversely impacted by, among other factors, plant closings and industry slowdowns;\n\u2022\nLocal real estate market conditions such as the oversupply of MH and RV sites or a reduction in demand for MH and RV sites in an area;\n\u2022\nA decrease in the number of people interested in the RV lifestyle or boating;\n\u2022\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates, including between the U.S. dollar and each of the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar and the British pound;\n\u2022\nThe number of repossessed homes in a particular market;\n\u2022\nAn oversupply of, or a reduced demand for, manufactured homes;\n\u2022\nThe difficulty facing potential purchasers in obtaining affordable financing as a result of heightened lending criteria;\n\u2022\nAn increase or decrease in the rate of manufactured home repossessions which provide aggressively priced competition to new manufactured home sales;\n\u2022\nThe lack of an established MH dealer network;\n\u2022\nThe housing rental market which may limit the extent to which rents may be increased to meet increased expenses without decreasing occupancy rates;\n\u2022\nThe perceptions by prospective tenants of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of our MH properties and the neighborhoods where they are located;\n14\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\n\u2022\nZoning or other environmental regulatory restrictions;\n\u2022\nCompetition from other available MH communities and RV resorts and alternative forms of housing (such as apartment buildings and site-built single-family homes) and from other marinas;\n\u2022\nOur ability to effectively manage, maintain and insure our properties;\n\u2022\nIncreased operating costs, including insurance premiums, real estate taxes and utilities; and\n\u2022\nThe enactment of rent control laws or laws taxing the owners of manufactured homes.\nWe may not be able to integrate or finance our expansion and development activities.\nWe build and develop new MH communities, RV resorts and marinas and we expand existing communities and marinas. Our construction and development pipeline may be exposed to the following risks which are in addition to those risks associated with the ownership and operation of established MH communities, RV resorts and marinas:\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to obtain financing with favorable terms for development which may make us unable to proceed with the development;\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, building and other governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs and delays, and even require us to abandon development of the property entirely if we are unable to obtain such permits or authorizations;\n\u2022\nWe may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore and as a result we may not recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring such development opportunities;\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of a property on schedule resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs;\n\u2022\nWe may incur construction and development costs for a property which exceed our original estimates due to increased materials, labor or other costs, which could make completing the development uneconomical and we may not be able to increase rents to compensate for the increase in development costs which may impact our profitability;\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to secure long-term financing on completion of development resulting in increased debt service and lower profitability;\n\u2022\nOccupancy rates and rents at a newly developed property may fluctuate depending on several factors, including market and economic conditions, which may result in the property not being profitable; and\n\u2022\nClimate change may cause new marina developments to be paused or restricted.\nIf any of the above risks occur, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nCompetition affects occupancy levels and rents, which could adversely affect our revenues.\nThe MH, RV and marina industries are highly-fragmented. There is competition within the MH, RV and marina markets we currently serve and in new markets that we may enter. We have both national and regional competitors in the MH, RV and marina markets. Our properties are located in developed areas that include other MH communities, RV resorts and marinas. The number of competitive MH communities, RV resorts and marinas in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease sites and increase rents charged at our properties or at any newly acquired properties. We may be competing with others with greater resources. In addition, other forms of multi\u2011family residential properties, such as private and federally funded or assisted multi-family housing projects and single\u2011family housing, provide housing alternatives to potential tenants of MH communities and RV resorts.\nThe cyclical and seasonal nature of the RV and marina industries may lead to fluctuations in our operating results\n.\nThe RV and marina industries can experience cycles of growth and downturn due to seasonality patterns. Results of operations in any one period may not be indicative of results in future periods. In the RV market, certain properties maintain higher occupancy during the summer months, while other properties maintain higher occupancy during the winter months. The RV market typically shows a decline in demand over the winter months, yet usually produces higher growth in the spring and summer months due to higher use by vacationers. In the marina market, demand for wet slip storage increases during the summer months as customers contract for the summer boating season, which also drives non-storage revenue streams such as service, fuel and on-premise restaurants or convenience storage. Demand for dry storage increases during the winter season as seasonal weather patterns require boat owners to store their vessels on dry docks and within covered racks. Our results on a quarterly basis can fluctuate due to this cyclicality and seasonality.\n15\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nWe may not be able to integrate or finance our acquisitions and our acquisitions may not perform as expected.\nWe have acquired and intend to continue to selectively acquire MH, RV and marina properties. Our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other well-capitalized real estate investors, including both publicly traded REITs and institutional investment funds;\n\u2022\nEven if we enter into an acquisition agreement for a property, it is usually subject to customary conditions to closing, including completion of due diligence investigations to our satisfaction, which may not be satisfied;\n\u2022\nEven if we are able to acquire a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price;\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to finance acquisitions on favorable terms;\n\u2022\nAcquired properties may fail to perform as expected;\n\u2022\nAcquired properties may be located in new markets where we face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, lack of business relationships in the area, and unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations.\nIf any of the above risks occur, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and we may be left with no, or limited, recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, we may have to pay substantial sums to settle any liabilities asserted against us based upon ownership of newly acquired properties, which could adversely affect our cash flow.\nWe depend on Safe Harbor's management to operate our marina business, and our acquisition of Safe Harbor presents us with new risks.\nBefore we acquired Safe Harbor in October 2020, we did not own or operate any marinas. Safe Harbor's operations are separate from our other operations. The successful operation of our marinas depends on our ability to retain key employees with experience in the marina business, including Baxter R. Underwood, who is the Chief Executive Officer of Safe Harbor. The loss of services of Mr. Underwood or other key employees could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to operate Safe Harbor. Although Mr. Underwood has entered into an employment and non-competition agreement, upon certain events he will have the option to eliminate the non-competition covenant by foregoing certain compensation and other benefits.\nWe do not currently maintain or contemplate obtaining any \"key-man\" life insurance on any of the key employees of Safe Harbor. Our entry into the marina business also subjects us to new laws and regulations and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk including but not limited to statutes and government regulations that govern the use of, and construction on, rivers, lakes and other waterways. Exposure to the marina industry may expose us to certain weather events and risks to which we have not previously been exposed. Additionally, the marina business may be affected in different ways or to a greater extent than our existing MH and RV business by the COVID-19 pandemic with respect to infection control, facility and work-site access, or other related issues.\nInvestments through joint ventures involve risks not present for properties in which we are the sole owner.\nWe have invested and may continue to invest as a joint venture partner in joint ventures. These investments involve risks, including, but not limited to, the possibility the other joint venture partner may have business goals which are inconsistent with ours, possess the ability to take or force action or withhold consent contrary to our requests, fail to provide capital or fulfill its obligations, or become insolvent and require us to assume and fulfill the joint venture's financial obligations. Conflicts arising between us and our joint venture partners may be difficult to manage or resolve and it could be difficult to manage or otherwise monitor the existing business arrangements.\n \nWe and our joint venture partners may each have the right to initiate a buy-sell arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire a joint venture partner's interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have entered into such a transaction. Each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated, and our ability to operate, finance or dispose of a property in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the applicable joint venture agreement.\n16\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nMany of our properties are located in areas that experience extreme weather conditions and natural disasters and climate change may adversely affect our business.\nExtreme weather or weather-related conditions and other natural disasters, including hurricanes, flash floods, sea-level rise, tornadoes, wildfires or earthquakes, may interrupt our operations, damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who utilize our properties in the affected areas. Many of our properties are on coastlines that are subject to hurricane seasons, flash flooding and sea-level rise; in areas adversely affected by wildfires, such as the western United States; and in earthquake-prone areas, such as the West Coast. If there are prolonged disruptions at our properties due to extreme weather or natural disasters, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWhile we maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain of the costs and loss of revenue associated with the effect of extreme weather and natural disasters at our properties, our coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits. We cannot assure you that we will be able to fully collect, if at all, on any claims resulting from extreme weather or natural disasters.\nIf any of our properties are damaged or if their operations are disrupted as a result of extreme weather or natural disasters, or if extreme weather or natural disasters adversely impact general economic or other conditions in the areas in which our properties are located or from which they draw their tenants and customers, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nSignificant changes in the climate could exacerbate extreme weather conditions or natural disasters that may occur in areas where our properties are located, all of which may result in additional physical damage to, or a decrease in demand for, properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions. If the impact of climate change is material in nature, including significant property damage to or destruction of our properties, or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, changes in federal, state, local and foreign legislation and regulation based on concerns about climate change could result in increased capital expenditures on our properties (for example, to improve their energy efficiency and / or resistance to inclement weather) without a corresponding increase in revenue, resulting in adverse impacts to our net income.\nMarinas may not be readily adaptable to other uses.\nMarinas are specific-use properties and may contain features or assets that have limited alternative uses. These properties may also have distinct operational functions that involve specific procedures and training. If the operations of any of our marinas become unprofitable due to industry competition, operational execution or otherwise, then it may not be feasible to operate the property for another use, and the value of certain features or assets used at the property, or the property itself, may be impaired. Should any of these events occur, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nWe may be unable to obtain, renew or maintain permits, licenses and approvals necessary for the operation of our marinas.\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Coast Guard and other governmental bodies control much of the land located beneath and surrounding many of our marinas and lease such land to Safe Harbor under leases that typically range from five to 50 years. As a result, it is unlikely that we can obtain fee-simple title to the land on or near these marinas. If these governmental authorities terminate, fail to renew, or interpret in ways that are materially less favorable any of the permits, licenses and approvals necessary for operation of these properties, then our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nSome marinas must be dredged from time to time to remove silt and mud that collect in harbor-areas in order to assure that boat traffic can safely enter the harbor. Dredging and disposing of the dredged material can be very costly and require permits from various governmental authorities. If the permits necessary to dredge marinas or dispose of the dredged material cannot be timely obtained after the acquisition of a marina, or if dredging is not practical or is exceedingly expensive, the operations of such property would be materially and adversely affected.\n17\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nWe may incur liability under environmental laws arising from conditions at properties we acquire or operations at the properties we own and operate.\nUnder various federal, state, local and foreign laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner or operator of real estate is liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances at, on, under, or in such property. Such hazardous substances may be used at or located on our properties, especially our marinas. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous substances. The presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner's ability to sell or rent the property, to borrow using the property as collateral or to develop the property. Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances also may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility owned or operated by another person. In addition, certain environmental laws impose liability for the management and disposal of asbestos-containing materials and for the release of such materials into the air. These laws may result in fines or penalties and may permit third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with asbestos-containing materials.\nAs the purchaser of properties we acquire or in connection with the operation of properties we own or manage, we may be liable for removal or remediation costs, governmental fines and injuries to persons and property. When we arrange for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances at landfills or other facilities owned by other persons, we may be liable for the removal or remediation costs at such facilities.\nWe subject our properties to a Phase I or similar environmental assessment as well as limited compliance evaluations (which involve general inspections without soil sampling or ground water analysis) completed by independent environmental and engineering consultants. In some cases, where these evaluations have recommended further, invasive investigations, those have also been conducted. These environmental evaluations have not revealed any significant environmental liability that would have a material adverse effect on our business. These audits cannot reflect conditions arising after the studies were completed, and no assurances can be given that existing environmental studies reveal all environmental liabilities, that any prior owner or operator of a property or neighboring owner or operator did not create any material environmental condition not known to us, or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more properties.\nMoreover, we cannot be sure that: (a) future laws, ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability; or (b) the current environmental condition of our properties will not be affected by tenants and occupants of the properties, by the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of our properties (such as the presence of underground storage tanks), or by unrelated third parties. Environmental liabilities that we may incur could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not complete our previously-announced acquisition of Park Holidays.\nIn November 2021, we entered into an agreement to acquire Park Holidays which owns, operates and manages 42 holiday communities in the United Kingdom. The acquisition values Park Holidays at an enterprise value of \u00a3950 million (or approximately $1.3 billion). While we anticipate that the Park Holidays acquisition will close in the first quarter of 2022, the closing is subject to the approval of the UK Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates certain loan brokering activities of Park Holidays. If this condition is not satisfied or waived, or if the Park Holidays purchase agreement is otherwise terminated in accordance with its terms, then we will not complete the Park Holidays acquisition. If we do not complete the acquisition, our common stock will not reflect any interest in Park Holidays; if the closing is delayed, this interest will not be reflected during the period of delay; and if the acquisition is restructured, it is uncertain as to whether this interest will be adversely affected. In addition, the price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects a market assumption that the acquisition will be completed and that we will realize certain anticipated benefits of acquiring Park Holidays.\nThe closing of the Proposed Loan Amendment is subject to, among other things, the closing of our acquisition of Park Holidays. Therefore, if we are unable to complete the acquisition of Park Holidays then we will be unable to complete the Proposed Loan Amendment. Refer to Note 19, \"Subsequent Events,\" in our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the Proposed Loan Amendment. \n18\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nThe intended benefits of the Park Holidays acquisition may not be realized.\nThe Park Holidays acquisition poses risks for our ongoing operations, including, among others:\n\u2022\nThat senior management's attention may be diverted from the management of daily operations in our U.S. and Canadian properties to the integration of the Park Holidays properties;\n\u2022\nCosts and expenses associated with any undisclosed or potential liabilities that are not covered by our transaction insurance;\n\u2022\nThat the Park Holidays properties may not perform as well as anticipated; and\n\u2022\nUnforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating operations in the United Kingdom into our company.\nAs a result of the foregoing, we cannot assure you that the Park Holidays acquisition will be accretive to us in the near term or at all. Furthermore, if we fail to realize the intended benefits of the Park Holidays properties, the market price of our common stock could decline to the extent that the market price reflects those benefits.\nWe will be subject to additional risks from our investment in Park Holidays and any other international investments.\nPark Holidays will be our first major investment in the United Kingdom. We are also pursuing other significant acquisition opportunities outside the United States, including in the United Kingdom and elsewere in Europe, although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in completing any of these prospective acquisitions. These investments may expose us to a variety of risks that are different from and in addition to those commonly found in our current markets. Our ownership of Park Holidays and any other international investments will subject us to additional risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe laws, rules and regulations applicable in such jurisdictions outside of the United States, including those related to property ownership by foreign entities, consumer and data protection, privacy, network security, encryption, payments and restricting us from removing profits earned from activities within the country to the United States (i.e., nationalization of assets located within a country);\n\u2022\ncomplying with a wide variety of foreign laws;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar, and exchange controls;\n\u2022\nlimited experience with local business and cultural factors that differ from our usual standards and practices;\n\u2022\nchanges in the availability, cost and terms of mortgage funds and other borrowings resulting from varying national economic policies or changes in interest rates;\n\u2022\nreliance on local management;\n\u2022\nchallenges in establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate operations in different regions and to monitor and ensure compliance with applicable regulations, such as applicable laws related to corrupt practices, employment, licensing, construction, climate change or environmental compliance;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tax, tariffs, trade barriers and other laws within jurisdictions outside the United States or between the United States and such jurisdictions;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences with respect to our properties;\n\u2022\nthe impact of regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability, including deterioration in political relations with the United States, instability in, or further withdrawals from, the European Union or other international trade alliances or agreements;\n\u2022\nthe impact of extreme weather or weather-related conditions and other natural disasters that may affect specific locations in which our properties are located, including hurricanes, flash floods, sea-level rise and coastal erosion, that may affect Park Holidays' properties;\n\u2022\nthe impact of disruptions in global, regional or local supply chains, including disruptions occurring during and after the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022\npolitical instability, uncertainty over property rights, civil unrest, drug trafficking, political activism or the continuation or escalation of terrorist activities.\nIf we are unable to adequately address these risks, they could have a significant adverse effect on our operations.\n19\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nThe United Kingdom's departure from the European Union could increase volatility in the financial markets and currency exchange rates, including the British pound.\nThe United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as \"Brexit,\" has created an uncertain political and economic environment in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. The consequences of Brexit, and continuing uncertainties related to Brexit, could negatively affect taxes and costs of business, diminish travel to and from the United Kingdom, cause volatility in currency exchange rates, interest rates, and European, United Kingdom or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions, and contribute to instability in political institutions, regulatory agencies, and financial markets. Brexit could also lead to legal uncertainty arising from divergence of the laws of the United Kingdom from those of the European Union. Any of these effects of Brexit, and others that cannot be anticipated, could adversely effect our existing and planned expansion in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, and therefore, could have a material adverse effect on us. \nThe current pandemic of the coronavirus, or COVID-19, may materially and adversely impact and disrupt our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and performance.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic at times has had, and in the future it could continue to have, or a future pandemic could have, material and adverse effects on our ability to successfully operate, and on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including in the following possible ways, among others:\n\u2022\nA downturn in the economy may affect the ability of the residents or customers in our MH communities and marinas to pay their rent.\n\u2022\nTravel restrictions may affect the ability of potential guests to travel to and use our RV resorts and marinas. A downturn in the economy may independently reduce demand for our RV resorts and marinas, and our RV revenue may decrease if we cannot convert as many transient RV sites to annual RV sites as planned.\n\u2022\nCertain properties may be subject to government restrictions which limit the ability to operate or provide certain amenities.\n\u2022\nWe may have difficulty accessing debt and equity capital on attractive terms, or at all, and a severe disruption and instability in the global financial markets or deterioration in credit and financing conditions may result in insufficient liquidity or affect our access to capital necessary to fund and grow our business and address maturing liabilities on a timely basis. As of December 31, 2021, we had drawn $1.0 billion on our senior credit facility, of which the total capacity, excluding the unexercised accordion feature, is $2.0\u00a0billion.\n\u2022\nThe financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact our future compliance with financial covenants of our debt agreements and result in a default and potentially an acceleration of indebtedness, which non-compliance could negatively impact our ability to make additional borrowings under our senior credit facility.\n\u2022\nOur ground up development and expansion activities, and conversions of transient RV sites to annual RV sites may be disrupted, and we may be delayed in our current projects and timelines, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the current governmental restrictions or limitations implemented in the future.\n\u2022\nThe ancillary revenue from amenities at our properties, such as restaurants, golf courses, resort and marina activities, may decrease.\n\u2022\nThe operation of our marinas may be disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic with respect to infection control, facility and work-site access, or other related issues. As result, we may experience delays in our current projects and timelines, the magnitude of which will depend on governmental restrictions or limitations implemented in the future.\n\u2022\nNegative impacts on our results of operations and our access to capital could cause us to eliminate or reduce the amount of our distributions to stockholders, or to pay some or all of our distributions in common stock rather than cash.\n\u2022\nA general decline in business activity and demand for real estate transactions could adversely affect our ability or desire to acquire additional properties.\n\u2022\nA recession or additional market corrections resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could affect the value of our common stock. We expect our stock price to continue to be volatile.\n\u2022\nGovernmental agencies that permit and approve our projects, suppliers, homebuilders, and other business partners and third parties may be prevented from conducting business activities in the ordinary course for an indefinite period of time, which could in turn negatively affect our business.\n\u2022\nDisruptions in the global supply-chain could negatively impact our ability to secure the volume of homes and vacation rentals we need to meet market demand. These disruptions also could drive up costs across our business including capital expenditures, homes, home setups, and general property operations.\n20\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our operations, financial condition and financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others. The rapid development and fluidity of this situation precludes any prediction as to the full adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to our performance, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and performance. Moreover, many risk factors set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be interpreted as heightened risks as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRent control legislation may harm our ability to increase rents.\nState and local rent control laws in certain jurisdictions may limit our ability to increase rents at our MH properties to recover increases in operating expenses and the costs of capital improvements. Enactment of such laws has been considered from time to time in other jurisdictions. Certain properties are located, and we may purchase additional properties, in markets that are either subject to rent control or in which rent-limiting legislation exists or may be enacted.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR DEBT FINANCINGS\nOur significant amount of debt could limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition, and we may incur more debt in the future\n.\nWe have a significant amount of debt. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $5.7 billion of total debt outstanding, consisting of approximately $3.4 billion in debt that is secured by mortgage liens on 190 of our properties, $1.2 billion of senior unsecured notes, $1.0 billion on our line of credit and other debt, $35.2 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred equity and $34.7 million of preferred OP units that are mandatorily redeemable. If we fail to meet our obligations under our secured debt, the lenders would be entitled to foreclose on all or some of the collateral securing such debt which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make expected distributions, and could threaten our continued viability.\nWe are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the following risks:\n\u2022\nOur cash flow may be insufficient to meet required debt payments, or we may need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay our debt rather than to other areas of our business;\n\u2022\nOur existing indebtedness may limit our operating flexibility due to financial and other restrictive covenants, including restrictions on incurring additional debt;\n\u2022\nIt may be more difficult for us to obtain additional financing for our operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service or other general requirements;\n\u2022\nWe may be more vulnerable in the event of adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business;\n\u2022\nWe may be placed at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to refinance at all or on favorable terms, as our debt matures.\nIf any of the above risks occurred, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nDespite our current indebtedness levels, we may incur substantially more debt in the future. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, an even greater portion of our cash flow will be needed to satisfy our debt service obligations. As a result, the related risks that we now face could intensify and increase the risk of a default on our indebtedness.\nCovenants in our credit agreements and senior unsecured note indentures could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe terms of our financing agreements and other indebtedness require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants. These covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations, and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if we have satisfied our payment obligations. Our financing agreements contain certain cross-default provisions that could be triggered in the event that we default on our other indebtedness. These cross-default provisions may require us to repay or restructure our senior credit facility in addition to any mortgage or other debt that is in default. If our properties were foreclosed upon, or if we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, the amount of our distributable cash flows and our financial condition would be adversely affected.\n21\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nOur senior credit facility contains various restrictive corporate covenants including: minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, maximum leverage ratio, maximum dividend payout ratio and maximum secured leverage ratio. In addition to our senior credit facility, our senior unsecured notes also contain various covenants including: aggregate debt test, debt service test, maintenance of total unencumbered assets and a secured debt test. These covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain transactions that might otherwise be advantageous. Furthermore, failure to meet certain of these financial covenants could cause an event of default under and / or accelerate some or all of such indebtedness which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAn increase in market interest rates could raise our interest costs on existing and future debt or adversely affect our stock price, and a decrease in interest rates may lead to additional competition for the acquisition of real estate or adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur interest costs for any new debt and our current debt obligations may rise if interest rates increase. This increased cost could make the financing of any new acquisition more expensive as well as lower our current period earnings. Rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing. In addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the access third parties have to credit, thereby decreasing the amount they are willing to pay to lease our assets and limit our ability to reposition our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions. An increase in market interest rates may lead prospective purchasers of our common stock to expect a higher\n \ndividend yield, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Decreases in interest rates may lead to additional competition for the acquisition of real estate due to a reduction in desirable alternative income-producing investments. Increased competition for the acquisition of real estate may lead to a decrease in the yields on real estate targeted for acquisition. In such circumstances, if we are not able to offset the decrease in yields by obtaining lower interest costs on our borrowings, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our risks associated with interest rates and could reduce the overall returns on your investment.\nWe use various derivative financial instruments to provide a level of protection against interest rate risks, but no hedging strategy can protect us completely. These instruments involve risks, such as the risk that the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes, that a court could rule that such agreements are not legally enforceable and that we may have to post collateral to enter into hedging transactions, which we may lose if we are unable to honor our obligations. These instruments may also generate income that may not be treated as qualifying REIT income for purposes of the REIT income tests. In addition, the nature and timing of hedging transactions may influence the effectiveness of our hedging strategies. Poorly designed strategies or improperly executed transactions could actually increase our risk and losses. Moreover, hedging strategies involve transaction and other costs. We cannot assure you that our hedging strategy and the derivatives that we use will adequately offset the risk of interest rate volatility or that our hedging transactions will not result in losses that may reduce the overall return on your investment.\nThe phase out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the replacement of LIBOR with a different reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates.\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\"), the authority that regulates LIBOR, ceased publishing one-week and two-month LIBOR rates after December 31, 2021. All other LIBOR settings will effectively cease after June 30, 2023, and it is expected that LIBOR will no longer be used after this date. Many of our property-level real estate loans have fixed interest rates that will not be impacted by any change in LIBOR. Certain of our other loans, including our borrowings under our $2.0 billion senior credit facility, have interest rates based on LIBOR. Our senior credit facility provides that the administrative agent in consultation with us will endeavor to determine an interest rate to replace the current LIBOR based rate, and until the parties agree on a successor LIBOR rate we can continue to borrow under the senior credit facility using the prime rate. The replacement of LIBOR with an alternative rate or benchmark may adversely affect our interest rates and result in higher borrowing costs. This could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nA downgrade in our credit ratings could have material adverse effects on our business and financial condition.\nWe intend to manage our operations to maintain our investment grade credit ratings from S&P Global and Moody's. These ratings are based on a number of factors, which include assessments of our financial strength, liquidity, capital structure, asset quality, and sustainability of cash flow and earnings. Changes in these factors could lead to a downgrade of our ratings, leading to an adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\n22\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nTAX RISKS RELATED TO OUR STATUS AS A REIT\nWe may suffer adverse tax consequences and be unable to attract capital if we fail to qualify as a REIT.\nWe believe that since our taxable year ended December 31, 1994, we have been organized and operated, and intend to continue to operate, so as to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code. Although we believe that we have been and will continue to be organized and have operated and will continue to operate so as to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we cannot be assured that we have been or will continue to qualify as a REIT. Qualification as a REIT involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements (some on an annual and quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. In addition, frequent changes occur in the area of REIT taxation, which require us to monitor our tax status continually.\nIf we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, our taxable income could be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates. Moreover, unless entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we also would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost. This treatment would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability to us for the years involved. In addition, distributions to stockholders would no longer be required to be made.\nFederal, state and foreign income tax laws governing REITs and related interpretations may change at any time, and any such legislative or other actions affecting REITs could have a negative effect on us.\nFederal, state and foreign income tax laws governing REITs, or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time. Federal, state and foreign tax laws are under constant review by persons involved in the legislative process, at the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and at various state and foreign tax authorities. Changes to tax laws, regulations or administrative interpretations, which may be applied retroactively, could adversely affect us. We cannot predict whether, when, in what forms, or with what effective dates, the tax laws, regulations and administrative interpretations applicable to us may be changed. Accordingly, we cannot assert that any such change will not significantly affect either our ability to qualify for taxation as a REIT or the income tax consequences to us.\nWe intend for the Operating Partnership to be taxed as a partnership, but we cannot guarantee that it will qualify.\nWe believe that the Operating Partnership has been organized as a partnership and will qualify for treatment as such under the Code. However, if the Operating Partnership is deemed to be a \"publicly traded partnership,\" it will be treated as a corporation instead of a partnership for federal income tax purposes unless at least 90 percent of its income is qualifying income as defined in the Code. The income requirements applicable to REITs and the definition of \"qualifying income\" for purposes of this 90 percent test are similar in most respects. Qualifying income for the 90 percent test generally includes passive income, such as specified types of real property rents, distributions and interest. We believe that the Operating Partnership has and will continue to meet this 90 percent test, but we cannot guarantee that it has or will. If the Operating Partnership were to be taxed as a regular corporation, it would incur substantial tax liabilities, we would fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and our ability to raise additional capital could be significantly impaired.\nPartnership tax audit rules could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 changed the rules applicable to U.S. federal income tax audits of partnerships. Under the rules, effective for taxable years beginning in 2018, among other changes and subject to certain exceptions, any audit adjustment to items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit of a partnership (and a partner's allocable share thereof) is determined, and taxes, interest, and penalties attributable thereto are assessed and collected, at the partnership level. Unless the partnership makes an election permitted under the new law or takes certain steps to require the partners to pay their tax on their allocable shares of the adjustment, it is possible that partnerships in which we directly or indirectly invest, including the Operating Partnership, would be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties as a result of an audit adjustment. We, as a direct or indirect partner of the Operating Partnership and other partnerships, could be required to bear the economic burden of those taxes, interest and penalties even though the Company, as a REIT, may not otherwise have been required to pay additional corporate-level tax. The changes created by these rules are significant for collecting tax in partnership audits and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that these rules will not have a material adverse effect on us.\n23\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nOur ability to accumulate cash may be restricted due to certain REIT distribution requirements.\nIn order to qualify as a REIT, we must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 percent of our REIT taxable income (calculated without any deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain) and to avoid federal income taxation, our distributions must not be less than 100 percent of our REIT taxable income, including capital gains. As a result of the distribution requirements, we do not expect to accumulate significant amounts of cash. Accordingly, these distributions could significantly reduce the cash available to us in subsequent periods to fund our operations and future growth.\nOur taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, are subject to special rules that may result in increased taxes.\nAs a REIT, we must pay a 100 percent penalty tax on certain payments that we receive if the economic arrangements between us and any of our TRSs are not comparable to similar arrangements between unrelated parties. The Internal Revenue Service may successfully assert that the economic arrangements of any of our inter-company transactions are not comparable to similar arrangements between unrelated parties. This would result in unexpected tax liability which would adversely affect our cash flows.\nDividends payable by REITs do not qualify for the reduced tax rates applicable to certain dividends.\nThe maximum federal tax rate for certain qualified dividends payable to domestic stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates is 20 percent. Dividends payable by REITs, however, are generally not eligible for this reduced rate, although the Tax Cut and Jobs Act permits a 20 percent deduction equal to the amount of qualifying REIT dividends received, thus bringing the maximum federal tax rate on qualifying REIT dividends to 29.6 percent. While this rule does not adversely affect the taxation of REITs or dividends paid by REITs, the more favorable rates applicable to regular qualified corporate dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less competitive than investments in stock of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the comparative value of the stock of REITs, including our common stock and preferred stock.\nProspective investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of this change on their effective tax rate with respect to REIT dividends.\nComplying with REIT requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities.\nTo remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy requirements and tests under the tax law concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. In order to meet these tests, we may be required to forego or limit attractive business or investment opportunities and distribute all of our net earnings rather than invest in attractive opportunities or hold larger liquid reserves. Therefore, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely to maximize profits.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future tax payments may be limited if we experience a change in ownership, or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels.\nUnder Section 382 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \"ownership change\" (generally defined as a greater than 50 percent change (by value) in its equity ownership over a rolling three-year period), the corporation's ability to use its pre-ownership-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset its post-ownership-change income may be limited. We may experience ownership changes in the future. If an ownership change were to occur, we would be limited in the portion of net operating loss carryforwards that we could use in the future to offset taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n24\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nRISKS RELATED TO RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OUR STRUCTURE\nSome of our directors and officers may have conflicts of interest with respect to certain related party transactions and other business interests.\nLease of Executive Offices\n - Gary A. Shiffman, together with certain of his family members, indirectly owns an equity interest of approximately 28.1 percent in American Center LLC, the entity from which we lease office space for our principal executive offices. Each of Brian M. Hermelin, Ronald A. Klein and Arthur A. Weiss indirectly\n \nowns less than one percent interest in American Center LLC. Mr. Shiffman is our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. Each of Mr. Hermelin, Mr. Klein and Mr. Weiss is a director of the Company. Under this agreement, we lease approximately 103,100 rentable square feet of permanent space. The lease agreement includes annual graduated rent increases through the initial end date of October 31, 2026. As of December 31, 2021, the average gross base rent was $19.95 per square foot. Each of Mr. Shiffman, Mr. Hermelin, Mr. Klein and Mr. Weiss may have a conflict of interest with respect to his obligations as our officer and / or director and his ownership interest in American Center LLC.\nUse of Airplane\n - Gary A. Shiffman is the beneficial owner of an airplane that we use from time to time for business purposes. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we paid $0.7 million, $0.3\u00a0million and $0.4 million for the use of the airplane, respectively. Mr. Shiffman may have a conflict of interest with respect to his obligations as our officer and director and his ownership interest in the airplane.\nTelephone Services\n - Brian M. Hermelin is a principal and a beneficial owner of an entity that installs and maintains emergency telephone systems at our properties. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we paid $0.2 million for these services, respectively. Mr. Hermelin may have a conflict of interest with respect to his obligations as our director and his position with and ownership interest in the provider of these services.\nLegal Counsel\n - During 2019-2021, Jaffe, Raitt, Heuer, & Weiss, Professional Corporation acted as our general counsel and represented us in various matters. Arthur A. Weiss is the Chairman of the Board of Directors and a shareholder of such firm. We incurred legal fees and expenses owed to Jaffe, Raitt, Heuer, & Weiss of approximately $10.3 million, $13.3 million and $11.1 million in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nTax Consequences Upon Sale of Properties\n - Gary A. Shiffman holds limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership which were received in connection with the contribution of properties from partnerships previously affiliated with him. Prior to any redemption of these limited partnership interests for our common stock, Mr. Shiffman will have tax consequences different from those on us and our public stockholders upon the sale of any of these partnerships. Therefore, we and Mr. Shiffman may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any sale of those properties.\nCertain provisions in our governing documents may make it difficult for a third-party to acquire us.\n9.8 percent Ownership Limit.\n In order to qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT, not more than 50 percent of the outstanding shares of our capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals. Thus, ownership of more than 9.8 percent, in number of shares or value, of the issued and outstanding shares of our capital stock by any single stockholder has been restricted, with certain exceptions, for the purpose of maintaining our qualification as a REIT under the Code. Such restrictions in our charter do not apply to Milton M. Shiffman, Gary A. Shiffman and Robert B. Bayer; trustees, personal representatives and agents to the extent acting for them or their respective estates; or certain of their respective relatives.\nThe 9.8 percent ownership limit, as well as our ability to issue additional shares of common stock or shares of other stock (which may have rights and preferences over the common stock), may discourage a change of control of the Company and may also: (a) deter tender offers for the common stock, which offers may be advantageous to stockholders; and (b) limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their common stock that might otherwise exist if an investor were attempting to assemble a block of common stock in excess of 9.8 percent of our outstanding shares or otherwise effect a change of control of the Company.\nPreferred Stock.\n Our charter authorizes the Board of Directors to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, none of which is currently outstanding, and to establish the preferences and rights (including the right to vote and the right to convert into shares of common stock) of any shares issued. The power to issue preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company even if a change in control were in the stockholders' interest.\n25\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nCertain provisions of Maryland law could inhibit changes in control, which may discourage third parties from conducting a tender offer or seeking other change of control transactions that could involve a premium price for our common stock or that our stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interest.\nCertain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law (\"MGCL\") may have the effect of inhibiting a third-party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of shares of our capital stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of such shares, including:\n\u2022\n\"Business combination\" provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between us and an \"interested stockholder\" (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10 percent or more of the voting power of our shares or an affiliate thereof or an affiliate or associate of ours who was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10 percent or more of the voting power of our then outstanding voting stock at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date in question) for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter impose fair price and / or supermajority and stockholder voting requirements on these combinations; and\n\u2022\n\"Control share\" provisions that provide that \"control shares\" of our company (defined as shares that, when aggregated with other shares controlled by the stockholder, entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a \"control share acquisition\" (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of issued and outstanding \"control shares\") have no voting rights except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares.\nThe provisions of the MGCL relating to business combinations do not apply, however, to business combinations that are approved or exempted by our Board of Directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. As permitted by the statute, our Board of Directors has by resolution exempted Milton M. Shiffman, Robert B. Bayer and Gary A. Shiffman, their affiliates and all persons acting in concert or as a group with the foregoing, from the business combination provisions of the MGCL and, consequently, the five-year prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements will not apply to business combinations between us and these persons. As a result, these persons may be able to enter into business combinations with us that may not be in the best interests of our stockholders without compliance by our company with the supermajority vote requirements and the other provisions of the statute.\nAlso, pursuant to a provision in our bylaws, we have exempted any acquisition of our stock from the control share provisions of the MGCL. However, our Board of Directors may by amendment to our bylaws opt into the control share provisions of the MGCL at any time in the future.\nAdditionally, Subtitle 8 of Title 3 of the MGCL permits our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to elect to be subject to certain provisions relating to corporate governance that may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change of control of our company that might involve a premium to the market price of our common stock or otherwise be in our stockholders' best interests. These provisions include a classified board; two-thirds vote to remove a director; that the number of directors may only be fixed by the Board of Directors; that vacancies on the board as a result of an increase in the size of the board or due to death, resignation or removal can only be filled by the board, and the director appointed to fill the vacancy serves for the remainder of the full term of the class of director in which the vacancy occurred; and a majority requirement for the calling by stockholders of special meetings. Other than a classified board, the filling of vacancies as a result of the removal of a director and a majority requirement for the calling by stockholders of special meetings, we are already subject to these provisions, either by provisions of our charter and bylaws unrelated to Subtitle 8 or by reason of an election to be subject to certain provisions of Subtitle 8. In the future, our Board of Directors may elect, without stockholder approval, to make us subject to the provisions of Subtitle 8 to which we are not currently subject.\nOur Board of Directors has power to adopt, alter or repeal any provision of our bylaws or make new bylaws, provided, however, that our stockholders may alter or repeal any provision of our bylaws and adopt new bylaws if any such alteration, repeal or adoption is approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the matter.\n26\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nOur share price could be volatile and could decline, resulting in a substantial or complete loss on our stockholders' investment.\nThe stock markets, including the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\"), on which we list our common stock, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. As a result, the market price of our common stock and preferred stock could be similarly volatile, and investors in our common stock and preferred stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. The price of our common stock and preferred stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nOutbreaks of disease, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and related stay-at-home orders, quarantine policies and restrictions on travel, trade and business operations;\n\u2022\nIssuances of other equity securities in the future, including new series or classes of preferred stock;\n\u2022\nOur operating performance and the performance of other similar companies;\n\u2022\nOur ability to maintain compliance with covenants contained in our debt facilities and our senior unsecured notes;\n\u2022\nActual or anticipated variations in our operating results, funds from operations, cash flows or liquidity;\n\u2022\nChanges in expectations of future financial performance or changes in our earnings estimates or those of analysts;\n\u2022\nChanges in our distribution policy;\n\u2022\nPublication of research reports about us or the real estate industry generally;\n\u2022\nIncreases in market interest rates that lead purchasers of our common stock and preferred stock to demand a higher dividend yield;\n\u2022\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates, including between the U.S. dollar and each of the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar and the British pound;\n\u2022\nChanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nAdverse market reaction to the amount of our debt outstanding at any time, the amount of our debt maturing in the near-term and medium-term and our ability to refinance our debt, or our plans to incur additional debt in the future;\n\u2022\nAdditions or departures of key management personnel;\n\u2022\nSpeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nEquity issuances by us, or share resales by our stockholders or the perception that such issuances or resales may occur;\n\u2022\nActions by institutional stockholders; and\n\u2022\nGeneral market and economic conditions.\nMany of the factors listed above are beyond our control. Those factors may cause the market price of our common stock or preferred stock to decline significantly, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations and prospects. It is impossible to provide any assurance that the market price of our common stock or preferred stock will not fall in the future, and it may be difficult for holders to resell shares of our common stock or preferred stock at prices they find attractive, or at all. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention and resources.\nSubstantial sales or issuances of our common or preferred stock could cause our stock price to fall\n.\nThe sale or issuance of substantial amounts of our common stock or preferred stock, whether directly by us or in the secondary market, the perception that such sales could occur or the availability of future issuances of shares of our common stock, preferred stock, OP units or other securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock or preferred stock, could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock or preferred stock and our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities. In addition, we may issue capital stock that is senior to our common stock in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy, to adjust our ratio of debt to equity or for other reasons.\n27\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nBased on the applicable conversion ratios then in effect, as of February\u00a015, 2022, in the future we may issue to the limited partners of the Operating Partnership, up to approximately 5.7 million shares of our common stock in exchange for their OP units. The limited partners may sell such shares pursuant to registration rights, if available, or an available exemption from registration. As of February\u00a015, 2022, there were no outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock under our equity incentive plans, and we currently have the authority to issue restricted stock awards or options to purchase up to an additional 614,662 shares of our common stock pursuant to our equity incentive plans. In addition, we have entered into an At-the-Market Offering Sales Agreement to sell shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2021, we have remaining capacity to sell up to an additional $1.25 billion of common stock under this agreement. No prediction can be made regarding the effect that future sales of shares of our common stock or our other securities will have on the market price of shares.\nOur business operations may not generate the cash needed to make distributions on our capital stock or to service our indebtedness, and we may adjust our common stock distribution policy.\nOur ability to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock, and payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock or preferred stock, to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nThe decision to declare and pay distributions on shares of our common stock in the future, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future distributions, will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors in light of conditions then existing, including our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, debt maturities, the availability of debt and equity capital, applicable REIT and legal restrictions, general overall economic conditions and other factors. Any change in our distribution policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe rely on key management\n.\nWe depend on the efforts of our executive officers, Gary A. Shiffman, John B. McLaren, Karen J. Dearing, Bruce Thelen, Aaron Weiss and Baxter R. Underwood. The loss of services of one or more of these executive officers could have a temporary adverse effect on our operations. We do not currently maintain or contemplate obtaining any \"key-man\" life insurance on our executive officers.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report financial results, which could result in a loss of investor confidence and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are required to establish and maintain internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Disclosure controls and procedures are processes designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed is communicated to management and reported in a timely manner. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in continuing to maintain adequate control over our financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Deficiencies, including any material weakness, in our internal control over financial reporting that may occur could result in misstatements or restatements of our financial statements or a decline in the price of our securities. In addition, as our business continues to grow, and as we continue to make significant acquisitions, our internal controls will become more complex and may require significantly more resources to ensure that our disclosure controls and procedures remain effective. Acquisitions can pose challenges in implementing the required processes, procedures and controls in the operations of the companies that we acquire. Companies that are acquired by us may not have disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting that are as thorough or effective as those required by the securities laws that currently apply to us.  Moreover, the existence of any material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal controls and procedures would require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a timely manner. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports, our reputation and operating results could be materially adversely affected, which could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which in turn could result in a reduction in the trading price of our common stock.\n28\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nCybersecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nWe rely intensively on information technology to account for tenant transactions, manage the privacy of tenant data, communicate internally and externally, and analyze our financial and operating results. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and that of our tenants, clients, vendors and employees in our facilities and on our network. In addition, we engage third party service providers that may have access to such information in connection with providing necessary information technology and security and other business services to us. This information may include personally identifiable information such as social security numbers, banking information and credit card information.\nWe address potential breaches or disclosure of this confidential information by implementing a variety of security measures intended to protect the confidentiality and security of this information including (among others) engaging reputable, recognized firms to help us design and maintain our information technology and data security systems, including testing and verification of their proper and secure operations on a periodic basis. We also maintain cyber risk insurance to provide some coverage for certain risks arising out of data and network breaches. Our senior leadership regularly updates the Board of Directors on security matters and meets at least annually to review program progress and plans, incidents if any, and emerging risks.\nDespite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure, as well as that of our third-party vendors, may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers (including through malware, ransomware, computer viruses and email phishing schemes) or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, fire, flood or other physical event, or other disruptions. Any such breach or disruption could compromise our or a third-party vendor's network and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could:\n\u2022\nResult in legal claims or proceedings,\n\u2022\nDisrupt our operations, including our ability to service our tenants and our ability to analyze and report our financial and operating results,\n\u2022\nDecrease our revenues,\n\u2022\nDamage our reputation,\n\u2022\nCause a loss of confidence,\n\u2022\nIncrease our insurance premiums, or\n\u2022\nHave other material adverse effects on our business.\nWe depend on continuous access to the internet to use our cloud-based applications. Damage to, or failure of our information technology systems, including as a result of any of the reasons described above, could adversely affect our results of operations as we may incur significant costs or data loss. We continually assess new and enhanced information technology solutions to manage the risk of system failure or interruption.\nLosses in excess of our insurance coverage or uninsured losses could adversely affect our operating results and cash flow.\nWe have a significant concentration of MH and RV properties in Florida and California and marinas on coastlines, where natural disasters or other catastrophic events such as hurricanes, flash floods, sea-level rise, tornadoes, wildfires and earthquakes\n \ncould negatively impact our operating results and cash flows. We maintain comprehensive liability, fire, property, business interruption, general liability and (where appropriate) flood and earthquake insurance, and other lines of insurance we have determined to be appropriate for our business, provided by reputable companies with commercially reasonable deductibles and limits. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate and adequate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice. However, certain types of losses including, but not limited to, riots or acts of war, may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable. In the event an uninsured loss occurs, we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from the affected property. We would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. If an uninsured liability to a third party were to occur, we would incur the cost of defense and settlement with, or court ordered damages to, that third party. A significant uninsured property or liability loss could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition and results of operations.\n29\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nExpanding social media platforms present new challenges.\nSocial media outlets continue to grow and expand, which presents us with new risks. Adverse content about us and our properties on social media platforms could result in damage to our reputation or brand. Improper posts by employees or others could result in disclosure of confidential or proprietary information regarding our operations.\nOur operations are subject to regulation under various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nOur properties and the operations at them are subject to regulation under various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. Compliance with laws and regulations that govern our operations may require expenditures and modifications of development plans and operations that could have a detrimental effect on the operations of our properties and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. There can be no assurance that the application of laws, regulations or policies, or changes in such laws, regulations and policies, will not occur in a manner that could have a detrimental effect on any property.\nWe may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nOur current and future investments in and operations of Canadian, Australian and United Kingdom properties are or will be exposed to the effects of changes in the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and British pound, respectively, against the U.S. dollar. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates cannot always be predicted; as a result, substantial unfavorable changes in exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.", "item7": ">ITEM 7. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying footnotes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to the results presented in accordance with GAAP below, we have provided NOI and FFO as supplemental performance measures. Refer to \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n in this Item 7 for additional information.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a fully integrated REIT. As of December 31, 2021, we owned and operated, directly or indirectly, or had an interest in, a portfolio of 602 developed properties located in 39 states throughout the United States, Ontario, Canada and Puerto Rico, including 284 MH communities, 160 RV resorts, 33 properties containing both MH and RV sites, and 125 marinas. We have been in the business of acquiring, operating, developing and expanding MH communities and RV resorts since 1975 and marinas since 2020. We lease individual sites with utilities access for placement of manufactured homes, RVs or boats to our customers. We are also engaged in the marketing, selling and leasing of new and pre-owned homes to current and future residents in our MH communities. The Rental Program operations within our MH communities support and enhance our occupancy levels, property performance and cash flows.\nCOVID-19 IMPACT\nThe impact of COVID-19 in 2021 was minimal compared to 2020.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to provide essential services using social distancing techniques and minimal contact. To promote social distancing, we are encouraging our residents to use our online rent payment portals and other payment methods. We continue to follow the numerous health and safety measures we previously implemented at our communities and our main office to keep team members safe. These measures include increased cleaning and sanitation of shared spaces and social distancing protocols throughout our footprint. We closely monitor and track orders by federal, state and local authorities, provide status updates to our operations and main office leadership teams, and adjust our operating processes accordingly. We have implemented and continue to encourage remote working arrangements, wherever possible, to keep our team members safe and to do our part to promote social distancing.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our operations, financial condition and financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others. The uncertainty of this situation precludes any prediction as to the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n53\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n2021 General Overview\n\u2022\nTotal revenues for 2021 increased 62.5 percent to $2.3\u00a0billion.\n\u2022\nCore FFO for 2021 was $6.51 per diluted share and OP unit, an increase of 27.9 percent over 2020.\n\u2022\nAchieved MH and RV real property Same Community NOI growth of 11.2 percent over 2020.\n\u2022\nAttained MH and RV Same Community occupancy of 98.9 percent.\n\u2022\nHome sales volume increased 42.6 percent to 4,088 homes in 2021 as compared to 2,866 in 2020.\n\u2022\nBrokered homes sales increased by 38.0 percent to 3,528 in 2021 as compared to 2,557 in 2020.\n\u2022\nAchieved 1-year, 3-year and 5-year total shareholder return of 40.8 percent, 120.1 percent and 210.3 percent, respectively, outperforming or in-line with the MSCI US REIT, Russell 1000, U.S. REIT Residential and S&P 500 indexes.\n\u2022\nWe acquired 54 properties, totaling over 16,800 sites, wet slips and dry storage spaces, and sites for expansion for a total purchase price of $1.4\u00a0billion. \n\u2022\nCompleted the construction of over 1,030 total sites at eight ground-up developments and re-development properties.\n\u2022\nDelivered nearly 580 total expansion sites in 11 MH and RV properties.\n\u2022\nSuccessfully integrated Safe Harbor, which contributed 16.5 percent of the real property NOI - Total Portfolio in 2021.\n\u2022\nReceived investment grade ratings of BBB and Baa3 with a stable outlook from S&P Global and Moody's, respectively, which provides us with an additional source of financing.\n\u2022\nClosed two underwritten senior unsecured note offerings for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion.\n\u2022\nClosed an underwritten registered public offering, in which we sold 4,000,000 shares of our common stock and completed a forward sale agreement for an additional 4,050,000 shares of our common stock, for net proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion.\n\u2022\nCompleted two forward sale agreements relating to an underwritten registered public offering of 4,025,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $185.00 per share.\n\u2022\nEntered into a definitive agreement to acquire Park Holidays, the second largest owner and operator of holiday communities in the United Kingdom for approximately \u00a3950.0\u00a0million, or $1.3\u00a0billion.\nProperty Operations\nOccupancy in our MH and annual RV properties, as well as our ability to increase rental rates, directly affect revenues.

The gain from the sale of the property was approximately $49.4\u00a0million.\nOn August 26, 2021, we sold four MH communities located in Arizona, Illinois and Missouri, containing a combined 1,137 sites, for $94.6\u00a0million. The gain from the sale of the property was approximately $58.7\u00a0million.\nConstruction Activity\nGround-up Developments\n - During the year ended December 31, 2021, we constructed over 1,000 total sites at seven ground-up development properties and one re-development located in California, Colorado, Texas, Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina.\nExpansions\n - We have been focused on expansion opportunities adjacent to our existing properties, and we have developed over 2,100 sites within the past three years. We have expanded nearly 580 total sites at 11 MH and RV properties in 2021. \nWe continue to expand our properties utilizing our inventory of owned and entitled land. We have 10,672 MH and RV sites suitable for future development.\nMarkets\nOur MH and RV properties are largely concentrated in Florida, Michigan, Texas and California, which contain 62.6 percent of our total MH and RV sites. We have expanded our market share in multiple states through recent acquisitions and increased our property holdings in high growth areas of the U.S. including retirement and vacation destinations.\nWe have also experienced strong revenue growth through recent acquisitions of RV resorts. The age demographic of RV resorts is attractive, as the population of retirement age adults in the U.S. is growing.

COMMUNITIES, INC.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nIn addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP in our \"Results of Operations\" below, we have provided information regarding net operating income (\"NOI\") and funds from operations (\"FFO\") as supplemental performance measures. We believe NOI and FFO are appropriate measures given their wide use by and relevance to investors and analysts following the real estate industry. NOI provides a measure of rental operations and does not factor in depreciation, amortization and non-property specific expenses such as general and administrative expenses. FFO, reflecting the assumption that real estate values rise or fall with market conditions, principally adjusts for the effects of GAAP depreciation / amortization of real estate assets. In addition, NOI and FFO are commonly used in various ratios, pricing multiples / yields and returns and valuation calculations used to measure financial position, performance and value.\nNOI is derived from operating revenues minus property operating expenses and real estate taxes. NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of operating performance because it is an indicator of the return on property investment and provides a method of comparing property performance over time. We use NOI as a key measure when evaluating performance and growth of particular properties and / or groups of properties. The principal limitation of NOI is that it excludes depreciation, amortization, interest expense and non-property specific expenses such as general and administrative expenses, all of which are significant costs. Therefore, NOI is a measure of the operating performance of our properties rather than of the Company overall.\nWe believe that GAAP net income (loss) is the most directly comparable measure to NOI. NOI should not be considered to be an alternative to GAAP net income (loss) as an indication of our financial performance or GAAP cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity; nor is it indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Because of the inclusion of items such as interest, depreciation and amortization, the use of GAAP net income (loss) as a performance measure is limited as these items may not accurately reflect the actual change in market value of a property, in the case of depreciation and in the case of interest, may not necessarily be linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset, as it is often incurred at a parent company level and not at a property level.\nFFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\") as GAAP net income (loss), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, real estate related impairments, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. By excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared period-over-period, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, and operating costs, providing perspective not readily apparent from GAAP net income (loss). Management believes the use of FFO has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. We also use FFO excluding certain gain and loss items that management considers unrelated to the operational and financial performance of our core business (\"Core FFO\"). We believe that Core FFO provides enhanced comparability for investor evaluations of period-over-period results.\nWe believe that GAAP net income (loss) is the most directly comparable measure to FFO. The principal limitation of FFO is that it does not replace GAAP net income (loss) as a performance measure or GAAP cash flow from operations as a liquidity measure. Because FFO excludes significant economic components of GAAP net income (loss) including depreciation and amortization, FFO should be used as a supplement to GAAP net income (loss) and not as an alternative to it.

Based on the location of our properties with transient RV sites, our portfolio generally produces higher revenues between April and September than between October and March. Real property - transient revenue is included in RV segment revenue. The following table presents the seasonality of real property-transient revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nReal property - transient revenue \n(in thousands)\nFor the Three Months Ended\nYear\nMarch 31\nJune 30\nSeptember 30\nDecember 31\nTotal\n2021\n$\n266,641\u00a0\n11.9\u00a0\n%\n27.3\u00a0\n%\n44.9\u00a0\n%\n15.9\u00a0\n%\n100.0\u00a0\n%\n2020\n$\n134,691\u00a0\n18.8\u00a0\n%\n15.6\u00a0\n%\n44.9\u00a0\n%\n20.7\u00a0\n%\n100.0\u00a0\n%\n2019\n$\n121,504\u00a0\n20.1\u00a0\n%\n23.2\u00a0\n%\n40.3\u00a0\n%\n16.4\u00a0\n%\n100.0\u00a0\n%\nIn the marina market, demand for wet slip storage increases during the summer months as customers contract for the summer boating season, which also drives non-storage revenue streams such as service, fuel and on-premise restaurants or convenience stores. Demand for dry storage increases during the winter season as seasonal weather patterns require boat owners to store their vessels on dry docks and within covered racks. Seasonal real property revenue was\u00a0approximately $246.6 million and $24.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2021, seasonal real property revenue was recognized 17.7 percent in the first quarter, 25.0 percent in the second quarter, 29.9 percent in the third quarter and 27.4 percent in the fourth quarter. In 2020, seasonal real property revenue was recognized 100 percent in the fourth quarter, given that the Safe Harbor acquisition closed during the fourth quarter.\n61\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 \nand \n2020\nReal Property Operations - Total Portfolio\nThe following tables reflect certain financial and other information for our Total Portfolio as of and for the years ended December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands, except for statistical information):\nYear Ended\nFinancial Information \nDecember 31, 2021\nDecember 31, 2020\nChange\n% Change\nRevenue\nReal property (excluding Transient)\n$\n1,166,704\u00a0\n$\n867,532\u00a0\n$\n299,172\u00a0\n34.5\u00a0\n%\nReal property - transient\n281,432\u00a0\n172,430\u00a0\n109,002\u00a0\n63.2\u00a0\n%\nOther\n151,720\u00a0\n90,157\u00a0\n61,563\u00a0\n68.3\u00a0\n%\nTotal Operating\n1,599,856\u00a0\n1,130,119\u00a0\n469,737\u00a0\n41.6\u00a0\n%\nExpense\nProperty Operating\n617,733\u00a0\n408,817\u00a0\n208,916\u00a0\n51.1\u00a0\n%\nReal Property NOI\n$\n982,123\u00a0\n$\n721,302\u00a0\n$\n260,821\u00a0\n36.2\u00a0\n%\n\u00a0\nAs of \nOther Information\nDecember 31, 2021\nDecember 31, 2020\nChange\nNumber of properties\n(1)\n602\u00a0\n552\u00a0\n50\u00a0\nWet slips and dry storage spaces\n45,155\u00a0\n38,739\u00a0\n6,416\u00a0\nMH occupancy\n96.6\u00a0\n%\nRV occupancy\n(2)\n100.0\u00a0\n%\nMH & RV blended occupancy\n(3)\n97.4\u00a0\n%\n97.3\u00a0\n%\n0.1\u00a0\n%\nSites available for MH & RV development\n10,672\u00a0\n10,025\u00a0\n647\u00a0\nMonthly base rent per site - MH\n$\n603\u00a0\n$\n589\u00a0\n(8)\n$\n14\u00a0\nMonthly base rent per site - RV\n(7)\n$\n526\u00a0\n$\n513\u00a0\n(8)\n$\n13\u00a0\nMonthly base rent per site - Total\n$\n585\u00a0\n$\n571\u00a0\n(8)\n$\n14\u00a0\n(1)\nIncludes MH communities, RV resorts and marinas.\n(2)\nOccupancy percentages include annual RV sites and exclude transient RV sites.\n(3)\nOccupancy percentages include MH and annual RV sites, and exclude transient RV sites.\n(4)\nAdjusted occupancy percentages include MH and exclude recently completed but vacant expansion sites.\n(5)\nAdjusted occupancy percentages include annual RV sites, and exclude transient RV sites and recently completed but vacant expansion sites.\n(6)\nAdjusted occupancy percentages include MH and annual RV sites, and exclude transient RV sites and recently completed but vacant expansion sites.\n(7)\nMonthly base rent pertains to annual RV sites and excludes transient RV sites.\n(8) \nCanadian currency figures included within the year ended December 31, 2020 have been translated at 2021 average exchange rates, respectively.\nThe $260.8 million increase in Real property NOI from 2020 to 2021 consists of $76.8\u00a0million from Same Community as detailed below, $148.0\u00a0million from the marinas and $36.0 million from recently acquired properties in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020.\n62\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nReal Property Operations - Same Community Portfolio\nA key management tool used when evaluating performance and growth of our properties is a comparison of the Same Community portfolio. Same Community refers to properties that we have owned for at least the preceding year, exclusive of properties recently completed or under construction, and other properties as determined by management. The Same Community data may change from time-to-time depending on acquisitions, dispositions, management discretion, significant transactions or unique situations. In order to evaluate the growth of the Same Community portfolio, management has classified certain items differently than our GAAP statements. The reclassification difference between our GAAP statements and our Same Community portfolio is the reclassification of utility revenues from real property revenue to operating expenses. A significant portion of our utility charges are re-billed to our residents.

We intend to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through available cash balances, cash flows generated from operations, draws on our line of credit, and the use of debt and equity offerings under our shelf registration statement. Refer to Note 8, \"Debt and Line of Credit,\" and Note 9, \"Equity and Temporary Equity,\" in our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nWe also intend to continue to strengthen our capital and liquidity positions by focusing on our core fundamentals, which are generating positive cash flows from operations, maintaining appropriate debt levels and leverage ratios, and controlling overhead costs. We take a disciplined approach to selecting the optimal mix of financing sources to meet our liquidity demands and minimize our overall cost of capital. In June 2021, we received investment grade ratings of BBB and Baa3 with a stable outlook from S&P Global and Moody's, respectively. We plan on leveraging this enhanced strength in the credit markets to utilize a greater proportion of unsecured debt to lower our cost of capital and increase our financial flexibility.\nAcquisitions\nSubject to market conditions, we intend to continue to identify opportunities to expand our development pipeline and acquire existing properties. We finance acquisitions through available cash, secured financing, draws on our lines of credit, the assumption of existing debt on properties, and the issuance of debt and equity securities. We will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that meet our criteria. Refer to Note 3, \"Real Estate Acquisitions and Dispositions,\" in our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recent property acquisitions.\nWe anticipate that our acquisition of Park Holidays will close within the three months ending March 31, 2022, subject to the approval of the UK Financial Conduct Authority. We anticipate that we will need approximately $1.3 billion in cash to fund the acquisition of Park Holidays.\nWe have obtained commitments from our lenders to amend, extend and upsize the Senior Credit Facility simultaneously with, and conditioned on, the closing of the acquisition of Park Holidays. The proposed amendment (the \"Proposed Loan Amendment\") would provide for borrowing up to an aggregate of $4.2 billion with the ability to upsize the total borrowing by an additional $800.0 million. The Proposed Loan Amendment would provide a revolving loan facility of up to $3.05 billion and a term loan facility of $1.15 billion. \nWe intend to use a portion of the proceeds from the Proposed Loan Amendment to fund the cash purchase price of Park Holidays. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully enter into the Proposed Loan Amendment on the terms described above or at all. If the Proposed Loan Amendment is not entered into, we may use our previously announced bridge loan, further described below, to fund all or a portion of the cash purchase price of Park Holidays.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures include\n \nexpansion sites and development construction costs, recurring capital expenditures, lot modifications, growth projects, acquisition-related capital expenditures, rental home purchases and rebranding cost.\n72\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nOur capital expenditure activity is summarized as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2021\nDecember 31, 2020\nExpansion and Development\n$\n201,601\u00a0\n$\n248,146\u00a0\nRecurring Capital Expenditures\n64,631\u00a0\n33,472\u00a0\nLot Modifications\n28,802\u00a0\n29,414\u00a0\nGrowth Projects\n77,037\u00a0\n28,315\u00a0\nAcquisition-related Capital Expenditures\n176,463\u00a0\n46,739\u00a0\nRental Program\n117,371\u00a0\n143,117\u00a0\nRebranding\n6,142\u00a0\nN/A\nOther\n524\u00a0\n9,320\u00a0\nTotal capital expenditures activity\n$\n672,571\u00a0\n$\n538,523\u00a0\nExpansion and development expenditures\n - consist primarily of construction costs such as roads, activities, and amenities, and costs necessary to complete home and RV site improvements, such as driveways, sidewalks and landscaping at our MH communities and RV resorts. Expenditures also include costs to rebuild after damage has been incurred at MH, RV or marina properties.\nRecurring capital expenditures\n - relate to our continued commitment to the upkeep of our MH and RV properties and include items such as dredging, dock repairs and improvements, and equipment maintenance and upgrades at our marinas.\nLot modification capital expenditures\n - are incurred to modify the foundational structures required to set a new home after a previous home has been removed. These expenditures are necessary to create a revenue stream from a new site renter and often improve the quality of the community. Other lot modification expenditures include land improvements added to annual RV sites to aid in the conversion of transient RV guests to annual contracts.\nGrowth projects\n - consist of revenue generating or expense reducing activities at MH communities, RV resorts and marinas. This includes, but is not limited to, utility efficiency and renewable energy projects, site, slip or amenity upgrades such as the addition of a garage, shed or boat lift, and other special capital projects that substantiate an incremental rental increase.\nAcquisition-related Capital Expenditures\n - consist of capital improvements identified during due diligence that are necessary to bring our communities, resorts, and marinas up to our operating standards. These include items such as: upgrading clubhouses; landscaping; new street light systems; new mail delivery systems; pool renovation including larger decks, heaters, and furniture; new maintenance facilities; lot modifications; and new signage.\nRental Program\n - investment in the acquisition of homes intended for the Rental Program and the purchase of vacation rental homes at our RV resorts. Expenditures for these investments depend upon the condition of the markets for repossessions and new home sales, rental homes and vacation rental homes.\nRebranding costs \n- includes new signage at our RV resorts and costs of building an RV mobile application and updated website.\nCash Flow Activities\nOur cash flow activities are summarized as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2021\nDecember 31, 2020\nDecember 31, 2019\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\n$\n753,572\u00a0\n$\n543,295\u00a0\n$\n476,734\u00a0\nNet Cash Used for Investing Activities\n$\n(2,338,249)\n$\n(2,486,517)\n$\n(1,010,457)\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\n$\n1,570,391\u00a0\n$\n2,000,844\u00a0\n$\n505,880\u00a0\nEffect of Exchange Rate Changes on Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\n$\n(157)\n$\n189\u00a0\n$\n411\u00a0\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash decreased by approximately $14.4 million from $92.6 million as of December 31, 2020, to $78.2 million as of December 31, 2021.\n73\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nOperating Activities\n - Net cash provided by operating activities increased $210.3 million to $753.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $543.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was driven by an increase in net income from property operations due to the acquisition of Safe Harbor in October 2020 and improved operating performance at our MH and RV properties.\nOur net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations may be adversely impacted by, among other things: (a) the market and economic conditions in our current markets generally, and specifically in metropolitan areas of our current markets; (b) lower occupancy and rental rates of our properties; (c) increased operating costs, such as wage and benefit costs, insurance premiums, real estate taxes and utilities, that cannot be passed on to our tenants; (d) decreased sales of manufactured homes; (e) current volatility in economic conditions and the financial markets; and (f) the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0Refer to \"Risk Factors\" in Part I, Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInvesting Activities\n - \nNet cash used for investing activities was $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $2.5 billion for year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in Net cash used for investing activities was driven by a reduction in cash outflows to acquire new properties due to the prior year acquisition of Safe Harbor. During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used for investing activities included the following:\n\u2022\nNet cash deployed of $1.6 billion to acquire 54 properties totaling over 16,800 sites, wet slips and dry storage spaces and sites for expansion, and 11 land parcels approved for development of nearly 4,000 MH sites.\n\u2022\nCash deployed of $672.6 million for capital expenditure activity.\n\u2022\nCash deployed of $242.6 million for issuance of notes receivable to real estate developers and operators.\n\u2022\nProceeds of $162.1 million from the disposition of six MH communities.\n\u2022\nProceeds of $113.8 million from sale of rental homes and equipment.\nRefer to Note 3, \"Real Estate Acquisitions and Dispositions,\" in our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nFinancing Activities\n - Net cash provided by financing activities decreased $430.5 million to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $2.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities included the following:\n\u2022\nProceeds of $1.1 billion from equity issuances, primarily due to the March 2021 underwritten public offering of an aggregate of 8,050,000 shares at a public offering price of $140.00 per share.\n\u2022\nIssuance of an aggregate of $1.2 billion of senior unsecured notes from issuances in June 2021 and October 2021.\n\u2022\nPayments of $390.8 million for distributions to holders of common stock and common OP units.\n\u2022\nNet payments of $198.9 million under our credit facility agreement, net of proceeds.\nRefer to Note 8, \"Debt and Line of Credit,\" and Note 9, \"Equity and Temporary Equity,\" in our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nEquity and Debt Activity\nRegistering of Debt Securities\nIn March 2020, the SEC adopted amendments to Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X and created Rule 13-01 to simplify disclosure requirements related to certain registered securities. The rule became effective January 4, 2021. In April 2021, we filed a new universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC registering, among other securities, debt securities of the Operating Partnership, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us.\n74\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nPublic Equity Offerings\nOfferings\nOn November 15 and 16, 2021, we entered into two forward sale agreements relating to an underwritten registered public offering of 4,025,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $185.00 per share. The offering closed on November 18, 2021. We did not initially receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by the forward purchaser or its affiliates. We intend to use the net proceeds, if any, received upon the future settlement of the forward sale agreements, which we expect to occur no later than November 18, 2022, to fund a portion of the Park Holidays total consideration, to repay borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facility, to fund possible future acquisitions of properties and / or for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nOn March 2, 2021, we priced a $1.1\u00a0billion underwritten public offering of an aggregate of 8,050,000 shares at a public offering price of $140.00 per share, before underwriting discounts and commissions. The offering consisted of 4,000,000 shares offered directly by us and 4,050,000 shares offered under a forward equity sales agreement. We sold the 4,000,000 shares on March 9, 2021 and received net proceeds of $537.6\u00a0million after deducting expenses related to the offering. In May and June 2021, we completed the physical settlement of the remaining 4,050,000 shares and received net proceeds of $539.7\u00a0million after deducting expenses related to the offering. Proceeds from the offering were used to acquire assets and pay down borrowings under our revolving line of credit.\nOn September 30, 2020 and October 1, 2020, we entered into two forward sale agreements (the \"September 2020 Forward Equity Offerings\") relating to an underwritten registered public offering of 9,200,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $139.50 per share. The offering closed on October 5, 2020. On October 26, 2020, we physically settled these forward sales agreements by the delivery of shares of our common stock. Proceeds from the offering were approximately $1.23\u00a0billion after deducting expenses related to the offering. We used the net proceeds of this offering to fund the cash portion of the acquisition of Safe Harbor, and for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nIn May 2020, we closed an underwritten registered public offering of 4,968,000 shares of common stock. Proceeds from the offering were $633.1\u00a0million after deducting expenses related to the offering. We used the net proceeds of this offering to repay borrowings outstanding under the revolving loan under our senior credit facility.\nAt the Market Offering Sales Agreements\nOn December 17, 2021, we entered into an At the Market Offering Sales Agreement with certain sales agents and forward sellers pursuant to which we may sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate gross sales price of $1.25\u00a0billion of our common stock (the \"December 2021 Sales Agreement\"), through the sales agents, acting as our sales agents or, if applicable, as forward sellers, or directly to the sales agents as principals for their own accounts. The sales agents and forward sellers are entitled to compensation in an agreed amount not to exceed 2.0 percent of the gross price per share for any shares sold under the December 2021 Sales Agreement. We simultaneously terminated our June 2021 Sales Agreement (as defined below) upon entering into the December 2021 Sales Agreement.\nOn June 4, 2021, we entered into an At the Market Offering Sales Agreement with certain sales agents and forward sellers pursuant to which we could sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate gross sales price of $500.0\u00a0million of our common stock (the \"June 2021 Sales Agreement\"), through the sales agents, acting as our sales agents or, if applicable, as forward sellers, or directly to the sales agents as principals for their own accounts. The sales agents and forward sellers are entitled to compensation in an agreed amount not to exceed 2.0 percent of the gross price per share for any shares sold under the Sales Agreement. We simultaneously terminated our previous At the Market Offering Sales Agreement entered into in July 2017 upon entering into the June 2021 Sales Agreement.\nThere were no sales of common stock under the December 2021 Sales Agreement as of December 31, 2021. We entered into forward sale agreements with respect to 1,820,109 shares of common stock under the June 2021 Sales Agreement for $356.5\u00a0million during the year ended December 31, 2021 prior to its termination. These forward sale agreements were not settled as of December 31, 2021 but we expect to settle them no later than September 2022. There were zero issuances of common stock under the prior At the Market Offering Sales Agreement entered into in July 2017, during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, and from inception through termination of such prior sales agreement, we sold shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of $163.8\u00a0million.\n75\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nOn October 5, 2021, we issued $450.0\u00a0million of senior unsecured notes with an interest rate of 2.3 percent and a seven-year term, due November 1, 2028 (the \"2028 Notes\"). Interest on the 2028 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on May 1, 2022. In addition, on October 5, 2021, we issued $150\u00a0million of senior unsecured notes with an interest rate of 2.7 percent and a ten-year term due July 15, 2031. These notes are additional notes of the same series as the $600.0\u00a0million aggregate principal amount of 2.7 percent senior unsecured notes due July 15, 2031 that we issued on June 28, 2021, described below. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $595.5\u00a0million after deducting underwriters' discounts and estimated offering expenses. The proceeds were used to pay down borrowings under our line of credit.\nOn June 28, 2021, we issued $600.0\u00a0million of senior unsecured notes with an interest rate of 2.7 percent and a ten-year term, due July 15, 2031 (the \"2031 Notes\"). Interest on the 2031 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2022. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $592.4\u00a0million, after deducting underwriters' discounts and estimated offering expenses. The proceeds were used to pay down borrowings under our line of credit.\nThe total outstanding balance on senior unsecured notes was $1.2\u00a0billion at December 31, 2021.\nThe obligations of the Operating Partnership to pay principal, premiums, if any, and interest on the 2031 and 2028 Notes are guaranteed on a senior basis by Sun Communities, Inc. The guarantee is full and unconditional, and the Operating Partnership is a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. Under Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X, as amended, subsidiary issuers of obligations guaranteed by the parent are not required to provide separate financial statements, provided that the subsidiary obligor is consolidated into the parent company's consolidated financial statements, the parent guarantee is \"full and unconditional\" and, subject to certain exceptions, the alternative disclosure required by Rule 13-01 is provided, which includes narrative disclosure and summarized financial information. Accordingly, separate consolidated financial statements of the Operating Partnership have not been presented. Furthermore, as permitted under Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi), we have excluded the summarized financial information for the Operating Partnership as the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the Operating Partnership are not materially different from the corresponding amounts presented in our consolidated financial statements and management believes such summarized financial information would be repetitive and not provide incremental value to investors.\nLine of Credit\nOn June 14, 2021, we entered into a new senior credit agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") with certain lenders. The Credit Agreement combined and replaced our prior $750.0 million credit facility, which was scheduled to mature on May 21, 2023, (the \"A&R Facility\"), and the $1.8\u00a0billion credit facility between Safe Harbor and certain lenders, which was scheduled to mature on October 11, 2024 (the \"Safe Harbor Facility\"). The Safe Harbor Facility was terminated in connection with the execution of the Credit Agreement. We repaid all amounts due and outstanding under the Safe Harbor Facility on or prior to June 14, 2021. We recognized a Loss on extinguishment of debt in our Consolidated Statement of Operations related to the termination of the A&R Facility and the Safe Harbor Facility of $0.2\u00a0million and $7.9\u00a0million, respectively.\nPursuant to the Credit Agreement, we may borrow up to $2.0\u00a0billion under a revolving loan (the \"Senior Credit Facility\"). The Senior Credit Facility is available to fund all of the Company's businesses, including its marina business conducted by Safe Harbor. The Credit Agreement also permits, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, additional borrowings (with the consent of the lenders) in an amount not to exceed $1.0\u00a0billion with the option to treat all, or a portion, of such additional funds as an incremental term loan.\nThe Senior Credit Facility has a four-year term ending June 14, 2025, and, at our option, the maturity date may be extended for two additional six-month periods, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. However, the maturity date with respect to $500.0\u00a0million of available borrowing under the Senior Credit Facility is October 11, 2024, which, under the terms of the Senior Credit Agreement, may not be extended. The Senior Credit Facility bears interest at a floating rate based on the Adjusted Eurocurrency rate or BBSY rate, plus a margin that is determined based on the Company's credit ratings calculated in accordance with the Senior Credit Agreement, which can range from 0.725 percent to 1.4 percent. As of December 31, 2021, the margin based on our credit ratings was 0.85 percent on the Senior Credit Facility.\n76\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nAt the lenders' option, the Senior Credit Facility will become immediately due and payable upon an event of default under the Credit Agreement. We had $1.0 billion of borrowings on the Senior Credit Facility as of December 31, 2021, all scheduled to mature June 14, 2025. As of December 31, 2020, we had $40.4\u00a0million of borrowings on the revolving loan and no borrowings on the term loan under our A&R Facility, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had $652.0\u00a0million and $500.0 million of borrowings under the revolving loan and term loan under the Safe Harbor Facility, respectively. These balances are recorded in the Unsecured debt line item on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Senior Credit Facility provides us with the ability to issue letters of credit. Our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility, but does reduce the borrowing amount available. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had approximately $2.2 million and $2.4 million (including none and $0.3\u00a0million associated with the Safe Harbor Facility) of outstanding letters of credit, respectively.\nWe have obtained commitments from our lender group to amend the Senior Credit Facility in connection with the acquisition of Park Holidays. Refer to Note 19, \"Subsequent Events,\" in our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the Proposed Loan Amendment.\nPotential Bridge Loan\nOn November 13, 2021, we entered into a commitment letter with Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (\"Citigroup\"), pursuant to which, and subject to certain terms and conditions (including the closing of the acquisition of Park Holidays), Citigroup (on behalf of its affiliates) committed to lend us up to \u00a3950.0\u00a0million, or approximately $1.3\u00a0billion converted at the December 31, 2021 exchange rate, under a new senior unsecured bridge loan (the \"Bridge Loan\"). If we enter into the Bridge Loan, the proceeds of the Bridge Loan will be used to finance a portion of the cash consideration payable for the acquisition of Park Holidays. As of December 31, 2021, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the Bridge Loan.\nFinancial Covenants\nPursuant to the terms of the Senior Credit Facility, we are subject to various financial and other covenants. The most restrictive financial covenants for the Senior Credit Facility are as follows:\nCovenant\nRequirement\nAs of December 31, 2021\nMaximum leverage ratio\n<65.0%\n28.4%\nMinimum fixed charge coverage ratio\n>1.40\n4.57\nMaximum dividend payout ratio\n<95.0%\n49.3%\nMaximum secured leverage ratio\n<40.0%\n15.3%\nIn addition, we are required to maintain the following covenants with respect to the senior unsecured notes payable:\nCovenant\nRequirement\nAs of December 31, 2021\nTotal debt to total assets\n\u2264 60.0%\n38.6%\nSecured debt to total assets\n\u2264 40.0%\n22.9%\nConsolidated income available for debt service to debt service\n\u2265 1.50\n5.81\nUnencumbered total asset value to total unsecured debt\n\u2265 150.0%\n431.7%\nAs of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the above covenants and do not anticipate that we will be unable to comply with these covenants in the near term.\n77\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nProactive management of transition away from LIBOR\nLIBOR has been used extensively in the U.S. and globally as a reference rate for various commercial and financial contracts, including variable-rate debt and interest rate swap contracts. However, based on an announcement made by the FCA on March 3, 2021, one-week and two-month LIBOR rates ceased to be published after December 31, 2021, and all other LIBOR settings will effectively cease after June 30, 2023, and it is expected that LIBOR will no longer be used after this date. In addition, it is expected that LIBOR will no longer be used in new contracts entered into after December 31, 2021. To address the impending discontinuation of LIBOR, in the U.S. the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\"ARRC\") was established to help ensure the successful transition from LIBOR to a more robust reference rate, its recommended alternative, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). SOFR is a new index calculated by reference to short-term repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury securities, as its preferred replacement for U.S. dollar LIBOR. We have been closely monitoring developments related to the transition away from LIBOR and have implemented proactive measures to minimize the potential impact of the transition to the Company, specifically:\n\u2022\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we issued two series of senior unsecured notes that each pay a fixed rate of interest. As of December 31, 2021, we have an aggregate balance $1.2\u00a0billion of senior unsecured notes.\n\u2022\nOur Senior Credit Facility agreement contains fallback language generally consistent with the ARRC's recommendation, which provides a streamlined amendment approach for negotiating a benchmark replacement.\n\u2022\nWe continue to monitor developments by the FCA, the ARRC, and other governing bodies involved in LIBOR transition.\nRefer to Item 1A. \"Risk factors\" in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information about our management of risks related to the transition away from LIBOR.\nInterest Rate Hedging\nDuring and subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2021, we entered into four treasury lock contracts with an aggregate notional value of $600.0 million to hedge interest rate risk associated with future issuances of fixed-rate long-term debt.\nLong-term Financing and Capital Requirements\nLong-term Financing\nWe anticipate meeting our long-term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled debt maturities, large property acquisitions, expansion and development of properties, other nonrecurring capital improvements and Operating Partnership unit redemptions through the long-term unsecured and secured indebtedness and the issuance of certain debt or equity securities subject to market conditions.\nWe had unrestricted cash on hand as of December 31, 2021, of approximately $65.8\u00a0million. As of December 31, 2021, there was approximately $994.5\u00a0million of remaining capacity on the Senior Credit Facility. At December 31, 2021 we had a total of 412 unencumbered MH, RV and marina properties.\nFrom time to time, we may also issue shares of our capital stock, issue equity units in our Operating Partnership, issue unsecured notes, obtain other debt financing or sell selected assets. Our ability to finance our long-term liquidity requirements in such a manner will be affected by numerous economic factors affecting the MH, RV and marina industries at the time, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the availability and cost of mortgage debt, our financial condition, the operating history of the properties, the state of the debt and equity markets, and the general national, regional and local economic conditions. When it becomes necessary for us to approach the credit markets, the volatility in those\u00a0markets could make borrowing more difficult to secure, more expensive, or effectively unavailable. In the event our current credit ratings are downgraded, it may become difficult or more expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing unsecured indebtedness as maturities become due. Refer to \"Risk Factors\" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If we are unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely impacted.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our net debt to enterprise value was approximately 18.0 percent (assuming conversion of all common OP units, Series A-1 preferred OP units, Series A-3 preferred OP units, Series C preferred OP units, Series D preferred OP units, Series E preferred OP units, Series F preferred OP units, Series G preferred OP units, Series H preferred OP units, Series I preferred OP units and Series J preferred OP units to shares of common stock). Our debt has a weighted average maturity of approximately 8.8 years and a weighted average interest rate of 3.0 percent.\n78\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.\nCapital Requirements\nOur capital requirements as of December 31, 2021 include both short and long term obligations: \nOur primary long-term liquidity needs are principal payments on outstanding indebtedness as summarized in the table below:\nPayments Due By Period (in thousands)\nOutstanding Indebtedness\n(1)\nTotal Due\nShort-term Obligation\n\u22641 Year\nLong-term Obligation After 1 Year\nRefer to \nPrincipal payments on long-term debt \n$\n5,698,458\u00a0\n$\n141,959\u00a0\n$\n5,556,499\u00a0\nNote 8.

Perpetual securities include one year of interest expense for payment due after five years.\nCertain of our nonconsolidated affiliates, which are accounted for under the equity-method of accounting, have incurred indebtedness. We have not guaranteed the debt of our nonconsolidated affiliates in the arrangements referenced below, nor do we have any obligations to fund this debt should the nonconsolidated affiliates be unable to do so. Refer to Note 6, \"Investments in Nonconsolidated Affiliates,\" in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about these entities.\nGTSC\n - During September 2019, GTSC, entered into a warehouse line of credit with a maximum loan amount of $125.0\u00a0million. During September 2020, May 2021 and December 2021, the maximum amount was increased to $180.0\u00a0million, $230.0\u00a0million and $255.0\u00a0million, respectively, with an option to increase to $275.0\u00a0million subject to the lender's consent.

We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to inherent uncertainties in making estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods.\nOur significant accounting estimates include acquisitions (of investment properties) and impairment (of long live assets or properties, right-of-use assets and goodwill). Refer to Note 1, \"Significant Accounting Policies,\" in our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our critical accounting estimates that affect the Consolidated Financial Statements and that use judgments and assumptions. In addition, the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under varied conditions and assumptions is discussed.\nImpact of New Accounting Standards\nRefer to Note 18, \"Recent Accounting Pronouncements,\" in our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements.\n80\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.", "item7a": ">ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur principal market risk exposure is interest rate risk. We mitigate this risk by maintaining prudent amounts of leverage, minimizing capital costs, and interest expense while continuously evaluating all available debt and equity resources and following established risk management policies and procedures, which include the periodic use of derivatives. Our primary strategy in entering into derivative contracts is to minimize the variability that interest rate changes could have on our future cash flows. From time to time, we employ derivative instruments that effectively convert a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes.\nOur variable rate debt totaled $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and at such dates bore interest at the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate or BBSY rate, plus a margin, and Prime or various LIBOR rates, respectively. If the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate or BBSY rates, and Prime or LIBOR rates increased or decreased by 1.0 percent, our interest expense would have increased or decreased by approximately $8.2 million and $3.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, based on the $821.2 million and $339.5 million average balances outstanding under our variable rate debt facilities, respectively.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nForeign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that fluctuations in currencies against the U.S. dollar will negatively impact our results of operations. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as a result of remeasurement and translation of the assets and liabilities of our Canadian properties, our Australian equity investment, and our United Kingdom assets and joint venture into U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in our results of operations and may adversely affect our financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, our stockholder's equity included $663.6 million and $250.8 million from our investments and operations in Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom, which collectively represented 9.9 percent and 4.5 percent of total stockholder's equity, respectively. Based on our sensitivity analysis, a 10.0 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and British pound would have caused a reduction of $66.4 million and $25.1 million to our total stockholder's equity at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nCapital Market Risk\nWe are exposed to risks related to the equity capital markets, and our related ability to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or other equity instruments. We are also exposed to risks related to the debt capital markets, and our related ability to finance our business through borrowings under other financing arrangements. As a REIT, we are required to distribute a significant portion of our taxable income annually, which constrains our ability to accumulate operating cash flow and therefore requires us to utilize debt or equity capital to finance our business. We seek to mitigate these risks by monitoring the debt and equity capital markets to inform our decisions on the amount, timing and terms of capital we raise.\n81\nSUN COMMUNITIES, INC.", "companyName": "Sun communities inc", "cusip": "866796105"}
