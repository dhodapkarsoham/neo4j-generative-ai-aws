{"item1": ">Item 1. Business\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOverview\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nApplied Optoelectronics, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \"AOI\") is a leading, vertically integrated provider of fiber-optic networking products, primarily for four networking end-markets: internet data center, cable television, (\"CATV\"), telecommunications, (\"telecom\"), and fiber-to-the-home (\"FTTH\"). We design and manufacture a range of optical communications products at varying levels of integration, from components, subassemblies and modules to complete turn-key equipment.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIn designing products for our customers, we begin with the fundamental building blocks of lasers and laser components. From these foundational products, we design and manufacture a wide range of products to meet our customers\u2019 needs and specifications, and such products differ from each other by their end market, intended use and level of integration. We are primarily focused on the higher-performance segments within all four of our target markets, which increasingly demand faster connectivity and innovation.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe four end markets we target are all driven by significant bandwidth demand fueled by the growth of network-connected devices, video traffic, cloud computing and online social networking. To address this increased bandwidth demand, CATV and telecom service providers are competing directly against each other by providing bundles of voice, video and data services to their subscribers and investing to enhance the capacity, reliability and capability of their networks. The trend of rising bandwidth consumption also impacts the internet data center market, as reflected in the shift to higher speed server connections. As a result of these trends, fiber-optic networking technology is becoming essential in all four of our target markets, as it is often the only economical way to deliver the desired bandwidth.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe internet data center market is our largest market. Our customers in this market are generally large internet-based (\u201cWeb 2.0\u201d) data center operators, to whom we supply optical transceivers that plug into switches and servers within the data center and allow these network devices to send and receive data over fiber-optic cables. The majority of the data center optical transceivers that we sell utilize our own lasers and subassemblies (we refer to the transceivers subassemblies as \u201clight engines\u201d), and we believe that our in-house technology and manufacturing capability for these lasers and subassemblies gives us an advantage over many of our competitors who often lack either development or manufacturing capabilities for these advanced optical modules.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe CATV market is our most established market, for which we supply a broad array of products, including lasers, transmitters and transceivers, and turn-key equipment. Sales of headend, node and distribution equipment have contributed significantly to our revenue in recent years as a result of our ability to meet the needs of CATV equipment vendors who have continued to outsource both the design and manufacturing of this equipment.\u00a0\u00a0As the complexity of CATV networks has increased over the years, equipment vendors, many of whom are our customers, have been under pressure to supply a wider variety of increasingly complex equipment to CATV multiple system operators (\"MSOs\").\u00a0\u00a0In order to meet these demands, many equipment vendors have looked to engage with suppliers like AOI who have the capability to design and manufacture various network equipment or subassemblies, rather than always developing these devices themselves.\u00a0\u00a0This outsourcing trend has been a significant contributor to the revenue we derive from the CATV market.\u00a0\u00a0We believe that our extensive high-speed optical, mixed-signal semiconductor and mechanical engineering capabilities position us well to continue to benefit from these industry dynamics.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the telecom market we supply lasers and laser subassemblies as well as transceivers.\u00a0 Our customers in this segment consist mostly of network equipment manufacturers (\"NEMs\") and other manufacturers of optical transceivers.\u00a0 Our NEM customers manufacture equipment used in telecommunications networks and our transceiver manufacturer customers use our lasers and subassemblies in the manufacture of their optical transceivers.\u00a0 Most of our products in this segment are purchased for use in advanced 5G mobile network deployments.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOur vertically integrated manufacturing model provides us several advantages, including rapid product development, fast response times to customer requests and greater control over product quality and manufacturing costs. We design, manufacture and integrate our own analog and digital lasers using proprietary Molecular Beam Epitaxy, or MBE, and Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD)\u00a0fabrication process, which we believe is unique in our industry. We manufacture the majority of the laser chips and optical components that are used in our products. The lasers we manufacture are tested extensively to enable reliable operation over time and our devices are often highly tolerant of changes in temperature and humidity, making them well-suited to the CATV, FTTH and 5G markets where networking equipment is often installed outdoors.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn \n2021, 2020 and 2019\n, our revenue was $211.6 million, $234.6 million, and $190.9 million and our gross margin was 17.8%, 21.5%, and 24.2%. In the years ended \nDecember 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\n, we had net loss of $53.7 million, $58.5 million, and $66.0\u00a0million, respectively. At\u00a0\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020\n, our accumulated deficit\u00a0were $142.2 million and $88.6 million, respectively. In \n2021\n, we earned 46.1% of our total revenue from the internet data center market and 44.6% of our total revenue from the CATV market. In \n2021\n, our key customers in the data center market included Microsoft Corp, a US based large datacenter operator, a US based NEM\u00a0and Amazon.com. In \n2021\n, \n2020\n, and \n2019\n, Microsoft accounted for 14.1%, 38.3%, and 32.2% of our revenue,\u00a0the\u00a0US based large datacenter operator accounted for 8.3%, 8.0%, and 0.4%,\u00a0the US based NEM accounted for 7.2%, 7.9%, and 1.6%, and Amazon\u00a0accounted for 5.5%, 11.5% and 24.0%, respectively. In \n2021\n, our key customers in the CATV market included ATX Networks Corp., Cisco Systems, Inc., and CommScope (which in 2019 acquired Arris, who had previously acquired the Motorola Home Business in 2013 and Pace Plc in 2016). In \n2021, 2020 and 2019\n, ATX accounted for 25.6%, 3.7% and 0% of our revenue, Cisco accounted for 11.9%, 7.5%, and 10.0% of our revenue, and CommScope accounted for 3.3%, 2.1%, and 3.7% of our revenue,\u00a0respectively.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIndustry Background\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nDuring \n2021\n, our four target markets, internet data center, CATV, telecom and FTTH, experienced a significant growth in bandwidth consumption and the corresponding need for network infrastructure improvement to support this growth.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe prevailing trends in our target markets include:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2011\n\n\n \nTrends in the Internet Data Center Market.\n To support the substantial increase in bandwidth consumption, internet data center operators are increasing the scale of their internet data centers and deploying infrastructure capable of higher data transmission rates. As a result, there is an ongoing transition from the use of copper cable, typically at speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second (\"Gbps\"), to optical fiber as a transport medium, typically providing speeds from 10 Gbps to 400 Gbps. In recent years, a number of leading internet companies have adopted more open internet data center architectures, using a mix of systems and components from a variety of vendors, and in some cases designing their own equipment. For these companies, compatibility of new networking equipment with legacy infrastructure is not as important, and consequently, these companies are more willing to work with non-traditional equipment vendors, which we believe creates an opportunity for optical device vendors. Moreover, transmission speeds have continued to increase among the companies who have previously transitioned from copper-based to fiber-based infrastructure, resulting in opportunities for optical device vendors to supply new optical transceivers capable of operating at these higher data rates.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\u00a0\n \n\n\n \nTrends in the CATV Market.\n In recent years, CATV service providers have invested extensively to support high speed, two-way communications and we expect that they will continue to do so. In North America, CATV service providers have upgraded their networks with new technologies like DOCSIS 3.1, which enables them to offer higher speed connections to their customers. In order to increase available bandwidth for their customers beyond the bandwidth possible with the introduction of DOCSIS 3.1, cable MSOs have been reducing the number of customers that are connected to a single node. By reducing the number of \u201chomes per node,\u201d the average bandwidth available to each customer is increased. Other new technologies, such as Converged Cable Access Platform (\"CCAP\") and Remote-PHY are under development by cable equipment suppliers. These technologies are being developed to be a cost-effective solution to provide higher available bandwidth to CATV customers.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs the complexity of CATV networks has increased over the years, equipment vendors, many of whom are our customers, have been under pressure to supply a wider variety of increasingly complex equipment to CATV MSOs.\u00a0\u00a0In order to meet these demands, many equipment vendors have looked to engage with suppliers like AOI, who have the capability to design and manufacture various network equipment or subassemblies, rather than always developing these devices themselves.\u00a0\u00a0This outsourcing trend has been a significant contributor to the revenue we derive from the CATV market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\u00a0\n \n\n\n \nTrends in the Telecom Market. \nThe telecom market is composed of customers who deploy wireline optical networks, other than Passive Optical Networks, or PONs, for telecom access networks, including for backhaul of cellular telephone signals. As demand for mobile internet connectivity has increased in recent years, reliable and high-speed optical networks have become increasingly important. In particular, the use of wavelength division multiplexing (\"WDM\") to expand the capacity of mobile networks has led to increased demand for\u00a0WDM components (including lasers and transceivers) by telecom equipment manufacturers. In coming years, we believe that the deployment of advanced 5G networks will result in increased demand for optical components, especially those used in connecting between antennas and base stations, as well as for backhaul as mentioned above.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\u00a0\n \n\n\n \nTrends in the FTTH Market.\n The FTTH market generally refers to the PONs that telecom service providers deploy. The most commonly deployed PON technology is Gigabit PON, or\u00a0GPON, which delivers up to 2.5\u00a0Gbps of data, but due to the splitting of the bandwidth among multiple users, the actual bandwidth delivered to an individual subscriber is far less than 2.5\u00a0Gbps. One approach that does support true 1\u00a0Gbps service to the home is wavelength division multiplexing PON, or WDM-PON, a technology that enables the transmission of multiple wavelengths of data over a single fiber-optic strand. We also see opportunities for 10 Gbps Ethernet Passive Optical Network (\"EPON\") and higher data rate PON networks in the future.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOur Solutions\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe experience certain challenges within our target markets, including continuous pressure to innovate and deliver highly integrated products that perform reliably in harsh, demanding environments and to produce high-quality devices in large volumes at competitive prices.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       5\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBy addressing the challenges in our target markets, we provide the following benefits to our customers:\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\u00a0\n \n\n\n \nEnable customers to deliver innovative products. \nWe leverage our extensive expertise in high-speed optical, mixed-signal semiconductor and mechanical engineering, and MOCVD and our proprietary MBE laser fabrication process to deliver technologically advanced products to our customers.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\u00a0\n \n\n\n \nEnhance efficiency and cost effectiveness of our customers\u2019 supply chains. \nWe design and sell products at the level of integration desired by a customer, from components to turn-key equipment, providing our customers a dependable, cost-effective and simplified supply chain.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\u00a0\n \n\n\n \nDeliver high quality, reliable products in high volume. \nAs a vertically integrated supplier, we are able to monitor and maintain quality control throughout the production process, using our internally produced components, where possible, for our final products.

In many cases, our telecom product offerings are identical or nearly identical to products that we sell in other markets (for example, CATV\u00a0or internet data center). As we continue to develop new technological capabilities, we intend to develop products specifically for telecom markets.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\u00a0\n \n\n\n \nContinue to penetrate the FTTH market. \nWe believe our WDM-PON technology is a cost-effective solution for delivering 1 Gbps bandwidth to a home. We intend to capture an increasing share of the FTTH market by delivering optical modules enabling 1 Gbps synchronous service to the home through our customers, who are either internet service providers or manufacturers of networking equipment supplying internet service providers. Besides WDM-PON, we also believe that PON networks operating at 10 Gbps or higher will be in demand by certain customers in the future and we intend to develop components for these networks.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\u00a0\n \n\n\n \nContinue to invest in our capabilities and infrastructure. \nWe intend to continue to invest in new products, new technology and our production infrastructure and facilities to maintain and strengthen our competitive position. We engage in an active research and development program to develop new products and enhance existing products.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\u00a0\n \n\n\n \nSelectively pursue other opportunities that leverage our existing expertise. \nOur expertise in designing and manufacturing outdoor equipment for the CATV industry positions us well to pursue applications that are also characterized by having varying and demanding environments, including wireless and wireline telecom infrastructure,\u00a0industrial robotics, aerospace and defense, and oil and gas exploration.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\u00a0\n \n\n\n \nPursue complementary acquisition and strategic alliance opportunities. \nWe evaluate and selectively pursue acquisition opportunities or strategic alliances that we believe will enhance or complement our current product offerings, augment our technology roadmap, or diversify our revenue base.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOur Technology\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe believe that we have technology leadership in four key areas: semiconductor laser manufacturing, electronic technologies that enhance the performance of our lasers, optical hybrid integration and mixed-signal semiconductor design.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\u00a0\n \n\n\n \nDifferentiated semiconductor laser manufacturing. \nWe use a combination of MBE and MOCVD processes in the fabrication of our lasers. We believe that the combination of these two epitaxial processes allows our products to benefit from the advantages afforded by each of these techniques. Among the differentiators of MBE relative to MOCVD fabrication are a lower process temperature and the use of solid phase materials rather than gaseous sources to grow wafers and the growth of more highly strained crystals. These factors contribute to longer operating lives of our lasers, improved laser efficiency and threshold current, and other performance attributes that make them well-suited to our target markets. While we believe that these advantages of MBE are important, MBE does have disadvantages including the inability to use certain dopant materials (for example, Iron), difficulty in certain types of regrowth, and the necessity to maintain complex ultra-high vacuum equipment. By utilizing MOCVD in a portion of our production process, we are able to ameliorate some of these disadvantages. However, the epitaxial and processing steps required in the fabrication of our devices are very complex, with numerous critical steps requiring highly precise control. As a result of some of these challenges, production yields and the performance attributes of laser devices are highly variable and optimizing these characteristics requires numerous enhancements and modifications to standard MBE equipment and the MBE process. To our knowledge, we are unique in incorporating MBE processes in the production of communications lasers in high volume, and believe it would be difficult and time-consuming for other vendors to replicate our production technology.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       7\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\u00a0\n \n\n\n \nLaser enhancement technology. \nCertain properties of the semiconductor lasers predominantly used in traditional communications devices, such as chirp and wavelength drift, negatively affect their ability to transmit signals over long fiber distances or prevent them from transmitting signals with acceptable fidelity in certain applications. We have developed laser enhancement circuitry that can correct many of these deficiencies. We believe that our technology will become more essential with wider deployment of higher capacity CATV and FTTH systems, which place more stringent demands on laser performance.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \nOptical hybrid-integration technology. \nReducing the size, power consumption and complexity of optical devices is essential for achieving the price and performance targets of our customers. Our ability to integrate multiple optical networking functions into a single device and to co-package multiple devices into smaller form factors helps us meet customer requirements, which we believe can also create new opportunities. For instance, the transmission speed between network elements (switches and servers, for example) within the data center has continued to increase. However, the rate at which this data can be converted from electrical signals to optical signals by laser diodes has not increased at the same pace. Therefore, to achieve data rates of\u00a040 Gbps and above, many customers utilize multiple lower data rate lasers co-packaged together into a single optical module, which we refer to as a light engine. The technology required to cost-effectively and reliably co-package these lasers and the associated electronic control circuitry is complex. Our extensive experience with the processes and the manufacturing technologies required to produce these devices gives us a competitive advantage.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSimilarly, in FTTH and telecom networks, installing new fiber-optic cable is expensive and difficult, and in some situations prohibitively so for a network service provider. As a consequence, network operators seek to maximize the utilization of their installed fiber plant. In long-haul and metropolitan networks, the number of service providers who deployed WDM technology as fiber utilization rose. Fiber utilization in access networks has risen, but the use of WDM technology in the access segment has been problematic due to the relatively high cost and power consumption of the requisite optical devices. We have developed proprietary miniaturized optical packaging, electronic control circuitry and testing algorithms to create a hybrid WDM-PON solution that addresses these historical impediments that we believe will make WDM-PON a cost-effective alternative for deployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \nMixed-signal design. \nAs CATV providers continue to evolve from primarily broadcast-video content providers to a mixture of HD video content together with data-connectivity providers, the networks they utilize to offer these services must evolve as well. Older analog networks are giving way to hybrid networks that incorporate both analog and digital signals. For example, many newer networks are being designed with \u201cdigital return-path\u201d capabilities, and certain MSOs have begun to deploy \u201cRemote-PHY\u201d technologies.\u00a0\u00a0Both of these technologies involve transporting certain network signals in digital format, and then converting these signals to and from analog signals at various points in the MSO\u2019s network. This combination of analog and digital signaling creates unique design challenges. Our engineers have many years of experience in developing equipment, modules and components that are well suited to these sorts of mixed-signal architectures. We believe that having deep experience in both digital and analog signaling allows us to offer superior solutions to our customers, compared with companies who have expertise in only one of these signal types.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOur Products\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOur products include an array of optical communications solutions at varying levels of integration. We begin from the fundamental building blocks of lasers and laser components. From these foundational products, we design and manufacture a wide range of products from optical modules to complete turn-key equipment. We design our products to target customers in our identified markets to meet their needs and specifications.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOur components often incorporate one or more of our optical laser chips inside a precision housing that provides mechanical protection as well as standardized electrical contacts. More complex optical components may also include optical filters (for example, for use in WDM) or other optical elements by which optical signals are routed internally within the component. These more advanced components may also include coolers, heaters and sensors that allow the temperature of the laser chip to be measured and controlled. We manufacture the majority of the laser chips and optical components that are used in our own products.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       8\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAt the next level of integration, our module or sub-assembly products typically contain one or more of our optical components and some additional control circuitry. Examples of modules include our transceiver line primarily used in internet data center markets, telecom markets, and FTTH markets.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAt the highest level of integration and complexity, our equipment products typically contain one or more optical components, modules and additional electronic control circuitry required to enable these subsystems to operate independently. For example, our CATV transmitter equipment requires utilization of our optical components and assembly onto a circuit board and to an external housing. Examples of equipment include our CATV transmitter and CATV nodes.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIntellectual Property\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret laws and unfair competition laws, as well as confidentiality and licensing arrangements, to establish and protect our intellectual property. We employ various methods to protect these intellectual property rights, including maintaining a technological infrastructure with significant security measures, limiting disclosure and restricting access to only those individuals with an operational need for such information, and having employees, consultants and suppliers execute confidentiality agreements with us. While we expect our intellectual property to provide competitive advantages, we also find meaningful value from unpatented proprietary process knowledge, know-how and trade secrets.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nPatents\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAs of \nDecember 31, 2021\n, we owned a total of 185 U.S. issued patents and 143 patents issued in China and Taiwan, plus a number of pending U.S. and foreign/international patent applications. Our issued U.S. and foreign patents will expire between 2022 and 2042. While our patents are an important element of our success, our business as a whole is not dependent on any one patent or group of patents. We do not anticipate any material effect on our business due to any patents expiring in 2022, and we continue to obtain new patents through our ongoing research and development.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur portfolio of patents and patent applications covers several different technology families including:\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2011\n\n\n \nlaser structure and design;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2011\n\n\n \noptical signal conditioning and laser control;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\u00a0\n \n\n\n \nlaser fabrication;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\u00a0\n \n\n\n \nphotodiode and optical receiver design and fabrication;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \noptical device and module designs;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\u00a0\n \n\n\n \noptical device packaging equipment and techniques; and\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\u00a0\n \n\n\n \noptical network enhancements.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nTrademarks\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe have registered the trademarks APPLIED OPTOELECTRONICS,\u00a0INC., AOI and our logo with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on the Principal Register. These marks are also registered in, or have applications for registration pending in, various foreign trademark offices.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nResearch and Development\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nTo maintain our growth and competitiveness, we engage in an active research and development program to develop new products and enhance existing products. As a result of these efforts, we anticipate releasing various new or enhanced products over the next several years.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       9\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs of \nDecember 31, 2021\n, we had a total of 226 employees working in the R&D department, including ten\u00a0with Ph.D. degrees. We continue to recruit talented engineers to further enhance our research and development capabilities. We have research and development departments in our facilities in Texas, Georgia, China and Taiwan. Our research and development teams collaborate on joint projects, and by co-locating with our manufacturing operations enable us to achieve an efficient cost structure and improve our time to market.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nA key factor in our research and development success is our highly collaborative process for new product development. Particularly in our equipment and module businesses, we often collaborate very closely with our customers from a very early stage in product development. By purposefully fostering this close collaboration, we believe that we can more rapidly develop leading solutions meeting the needs of our customers.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nManufacturing and Operations\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe have three manufacturing sites: Sugar Land, Texas, Ningbo, China and Taipei, Taiwan. Our research and development functions are generally partnered with our manufacturing locations, and we have an additional research and development facility in Duluth, Georgia. In our Sugar Land facility, we manufacture laser chips (utilizing our MBE and MOCVD processes), subassemblies and components. The subassemblies are used in the manufacture of components by our other manufacturing facilities or sold to third parties as modules. We manufacture our laser chips only within our Sugar Land facility, where our laser design team is located. In our Taiwan location, we manufacture optical components, such as our butterfly lasers, which incorporate laser chips, subassemblies and components manufactured within our Sugar Land facility. In addition, in our Taiwan location, we manufacture transceivers for the internet data center, telecom, FTTH and other markets. In our China facility, we take advantage of lower labor costs and manufacture certain more labor intensive components and optical equipment systems, such as optical subassemblies and transceivers for the internet data center market, CATV transmitters (at the headend) and CATV outdoor equipment (at the node). Each manufacturing facility conducts testing on the components, modules or subsystems it manufactures and each facility is certified to ISO\u00a09001:2015. Our facilities in Ningbo, China, Taipei, Taiwan, and Sugar Land, Texas are all certified to ISO 14001:2015.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe sell our products to customers worldwide, and in addition to these external customer sales many of our products are used internally in the production of transceivers and equipment that we manufacture. With a vertically integrated manufacturing process, we produce many of our own laser chips and other parts required to manufacture our optical components. Through this model, we are able to reduce development time and product costs as well as actively monitor and control product quality. We incorporate our own components into our transceivers, subsystems and equipment products wherever possible. In instances where we do not produce components ourselves, we source them from external suppliers and regularly evaluate these relationships in an attempt to reduce risk and lower cost.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers, including in some cases our own internal supply, for certain raw materials and components used in our products. We regularly review our vendor relationships in an attempt to mitigate risks and lower costs, especially where we depend on one or two vendors for critical components or raw materials. While maintaining inventories that we believe are sufficient to meet our near-term needs, we strive not to carry significant inventories of externally sourced raw materials. Accordingly, we maintain ongoing communications with our vendors in order to help prevent any interruptions in supply, and have implemented a supply-chain management program to maintain quality and lower purchase prices through standardized purchasing efficiencies and design requirements.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nCustomers\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOur customers are primarily internet data center operators, CATV and telecom equipment manufacturers, and internet service providers. We generally employ a direct sales model in North America and in the rest of the world we use both direct and indirect sales channels. In \n2021, 2020 and 2019\n, we obtained 92.8%, 97.6%, and 98.0% of our revenue, respectively, through our direct sales efforts and the remainder of our revenue through our indirect sales channels. Our sales channel partners provide logistical services and day-to-day customer support. Where we sell through an indirect sales channel, we work with the end customer to establish technological specifications for our products. Our equipment customers typically offer our equipment under their brand-name and our equipment is often customized with unique design or performance criteria by each of these customers. We also from time to time offer design or manufacturing services to customers to assist them in more effectively using our products and realizing time-to-market advantages.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       10\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the last three years, we have taken several actions to increase the diversity of our customer base. These actions include hiring sales staff to improve our ability to serve new customers and the introduction of new products that we believe will appeal to new customers. Furthermore, we have developed additional original design manufacturer, or ODM, relationships with customers in each of our target markets which should enable us to diversify our revenue base.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIn \n2021\n, the three customers who contributed most to our data center revenue were Microsoft, a US based large datacenter operator and a US based NEM. Our CATV products were used by three large CATV original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, consisting of ATX, Cisco and CommScope. In \n2021\n, revenue from the internet data center market, CATV market, telecom market, FTTH market and other markets provided 46.1%, 44.6%, 7.7%, 0.5% and 1.2% of our revenue, respectively, compared to 73.9%, 16.2%, 9.0%, 0.01% and 0.9%, respectively, in \n2020\n.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIn our telecom market, we manufacture and sell optical products which include transceivers designed to transmit signals used in 5th Generation (\"5G\") mobile networks, and various products targeted at the metro-scale telecom networking market. \u00a0\u00a0We have various other products designed for diverse applications, both inside and outside of communications technology, which generally are derivatives of products developed for our four target markets.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe support our sales efforts by attendance at industry trade shows (virtually and in person), technical conferences and other promotional efforts. These efforts are aimed at attracting new customers and enhancing our existing customer relationships.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nBacklog\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe generally make sales pursuant to short-term purchase orders without deposits and subject to rescheduling, revision or cancellation on short notice. We accordingly believe that purchase orders are not an accurate indicator of our future sales and any backlog of purchase orders is not a reliable indicator of our future revenue.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nCompetition\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe optical networking market is intensely competitive. Because of the broad nature of our product offerings, we do not believe that we face a single major competitor across all of our markets. We do, however, experience intense competition in each product area from a number of manufacturers and we anticipate that competition will increase. Our major competitors in one or more of our markets include EMCORE Corporation, Finisar Corporation who was acquired by II-VI Incorporated, Foxconn Interconnect Technology Ltd., InnoLight Technology (Suzhou) Ltd., Intel Corporation, Lumentum Holdings, Inc., Mitsubishi, Molex, LLC, Source Photonics, Inc. and Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nMany of our competitors are larger than we are and have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, several of our competitors have large market capitalizations or cash reserves and are much better positioned to acquire other companies to gain new technologies or products that may displace our products. Network equipment providers, who are our customers, and network service providers, who are supplied by our customers, may decide to manufacture the optical subsystems incorporated into their network systems in-house. We also encounter potential customers that, because of existing relationships, are committed to the products offered by these competitors.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe believe the principal competitive factors in our target markets include the following:\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \nuse of internally manufactured components;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\u00a0\n \n\n\n \nproduct breadth and functionality;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \ntiming and pace of new product development;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\u00a0\n \n\n\n \nbreadth of customer base;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\u00a0\n \n\n\n \ntechnological expertise;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\u00a0\n \n\n\n \nreliability of products;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\u00a0\n \n\n\n \nproduct pricing; and\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\u00a0\n \n\n\n \nmanufacturing efficiency.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe believe that we compete favorably with respect to the above factors based on our MBE and MOCVD processes, our vertically integrated model, the performance and reliability of our product offerings, and our technical expertise in light engine design and manufacture.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       11\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nSeasonality \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSee Part II, Item\u00a07, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Seasonality,\u201d regarding seasonality of certain of the Company\u2019s products.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nHuman Capital \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEmployees\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs of \nDecember 31, 2021\n, we employed 2,534 full-time employees, of which 36 held Ph.D. degrees in a science or engineering field. Of our employees, 367 are located in the U.S., 514 are located in Taiwan and 1653 are located in China.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs of \nDecember 31, 2021\n, none of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining agreement, but certain employees of our China subsidiary are members of a trade union. We have never suffered any work stoppage as a result of an employment related strike or any employee related dispute and believe that we have satisfactory relations with our employees.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEmployee Engagement, Development and Career Planning\n \u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur business results depend in part on our ability to successfully manage our human capital resources, including attracting, identifying, and retaining key talent. Factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, competition from other employers, and availability of qualified individuals.\u00a0 We believe our commitment to our human capital resources is an important component of our mission to deliver superior products to our customers. We provide all employees with the opportunity to share their opinions in open dialogues with our human resources department and senior management. In the past, we have conducted confidential surveys of select workforce members to measure engagement. The results are discussed with senior leadership and managers. We provide all employees a wide range of professional development experiences, both formal and informal. We offer our highest level employees/executives/VPs leadership development programs as part of our talent and succession planning process. Also, we have development programs for managers and supervisors and learning opportunities for all employees. We provide access to learning platforms so employees can access resources to support their career aspirations and advance their skills.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEmployee Safety\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe safety of our employees is a paramount value for us. We provide mandatory safety trainings in our production facilities, which are designed to focus on empowering our employees with the knowledge and tools they need to make safe choices and to mitigate risks. Supervisors complete safety management courses as well. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees and which comply with government orders in all the states and countries where we operate. In an effort to keep our employees safe and to maintain operations during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented a number of new health-related measures including, the requirement to wear company provided face-masks at all times while on company property, implemented temperature taking protocols, increased hygiene, cleaning and sanitizing procedures at all Company sites,\u00a0 implemented social-distancing, implemented restrictions on visitors to our facilities, limiting in-person meetings and other gatherings.\n \u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCompensation, Benefits and Wellness\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe offer fair, competitive compensation and benefits that support our employees\u2019 overall wellness. Further, the health and wellness of our employees are critical to our success. We provide our employees with access to a variety of innovative, flexible and convenient health and wellness programs. Such programs are designed to support employees' physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors. We offer financial education and financial wellness tools and resources to help employees reach their personal financial goals. Additionally, we provide robust compensation and benefits through internal and external benchmarking.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGovernmental Regulations \n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOur research and development and manufacturing operations and our products are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing discharges of pollutants to air and water, the use, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and solid wastes, employee health and safety, and the hazardous material content in our products. To date, costs and accruals incurred to comply with these governmental regulations have not been material to our capital expenditures, results of operations, and competitive position. Our environmental management systems in our facilities in Sugar Land, Texas, Ningbo, China and Taipei, Taiwan are all certified to meet the requirements of ISO14001:2015. However, there can be no assurance that violations of applicable laws at any of our facilities will not occur in the future as a result of human error, accident, equipment failure or other causes. We use, store and dispose of hazardous materials and solid wastes in our manufacturing operations and hazardous materials are present in our products. We incur costs to comply with environmental, health and safety requirements, and any failure to comply, or the identification of contamination for which we are found liable, could cause us to incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, natural resource damages, monetary fines, or administrative, civil or criminal penalties, and subject us to property damage and personal injury claims, and result in injunctive relief including the suspension of production, alteration or upgrades of our manufacturing processes, redesign of our products, or curtailment of sales, and could result in adverse publicity. Liability under environmental, health and safety laws can be joint and several and without regard to fault or negligence. For example, pursuant to environmental laws and regulations, including but not limited to the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, we may be liable for the full amount of any remediation-related costs at properties we currently own or operate or formerly owned, such as our currently owned Sugar Land, Texas facility, or at properties at which we previously operated, as well as at properties we will own or operate in the future, and properties to which we have sent hazardous substances, whether or not we caused the contamination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       12\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEnvironment\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations, products, and services and to reducing our environmental impact across our business. Our operations and many of our products are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign regulations that have been adopted with respect to the environment, such as the Directive on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment; Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals; and Substances of Concern In Products, regulations adopted by the European Union, or EU.\n\n\n\n    \u00a0\n  \n\n\n\n\nOver and above our commitment to compliance with all environmental laws, we have further committed ourselves to the following environment goals:\n\n\n\n\n\n    \u00a0\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nObtain at least 20% of the energy used in our operations from renewable sources\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nProperly recycle waste materials including paper, electronic components, glass and batteries\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nReduce our generation of hazardous waste by at least 10% over the five year period beginning in 2021\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn order to meet these goals, we maintain an Integrated Environmental and Safety Management System.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe expect that our operations and products will be affected by new environmental requirements on an ongoing basis. Environmental, health and safety requirements have become more stringent over time, and changes to existing requirements could restrict our ability to expand our facilities, require us to acquire costly pollution control equipment, require us to obtain additional permits for our activities, or cause us to incur other significant expenses or to modify our manufacturing processes or the hazardous material content of our products. Identification of presently unidentified environmental conditions, more vigorous enforcement by a governmental authority, enactment of more stringent legal requirements or other unanticipated events could give rise to adverse publicity, restrict our operations, affect the design or marketability of our products or otherwise cause us to incur material environmental costs or delays in planned activities.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and upcoming requirements relating to the materials composition of our products. Some jurisdictions in which our products are sold have enacted requirements regarding the hazardous material content of certain products. For example, member states of the European Union and China are among a growing number of jurisdictions that have placed restrictions on the use of lead, among other chemicals, in electronic products, which affect the composition and packaging of our products. The passage of such requirements in additional jurisdictions, or the tightening of standards or elimination of certain exemptions in jurisdictions where our products are already subject to such requirements, could cause us to incur significant expenditures to make our products compliant with new requirements, or could limit the markets into which we may sell our products. Other governmental regulations may require us to reengineer our products to use components that are more environmentally compatible, resulting in additional costs to us.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nExport Controls\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) of the U.S. Department of Commerce is responsible for regulating the export of most commercial items that are classified as dual-use goods that may have both commercial and military applications. Our products are classified under Export Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 5A991 and 6A995. Export Control Classification requirements are dependent upon an item\u2019s technical characteristics, the destination, the end-use, and the end-user, and other activities of the end-user. Should the ECCN change, then the export of our products to certain countries would be restricted. However, we currently do not export our products to any countries on the restricted list, and therefore a change in the ECCN would not materially impact our business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdditional information concerning regulatory compliance and a discussion of the risks associated with governmental regulations that may materially impact us is described more fully under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nSources of Raw Materials\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, and equipment used in our products. We continually review our supplier relationships to mitigate risks and lower costs, especially where we depend on one or two suppliers for critical components or raw materials. While maintaining inventories that we believe are sufficient to meet our near-term needs, we strive not to carry significant inventories of raw materials. Accordingly, we maintain ongoing communications with our suppliers in order to prevent any interruptions in supply, and have implemented a supply-chain management program to maintain quality and lower purchase prices through standardized purchasing efficiencies and design requirements. To date, we generally have been able to obtain sufficient quantities of critical supplies in a timely manner.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe are subject to rules promulgated by the SEC pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act regarding the use of \"conflict minerals\". These rules have imposed and will continue to impose additional costs and may introduce new risks related to our ability to verify the origin of any \"conflict minerals\" used in our products.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCorporate Information\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe were incorporated in the State of Texas in 1997. In March 2013, Applied Optoelectronics, Inc., a Texas corporation, converted into a Delaware corporation. Prime World International Holdings, Ltd. (\u201cPrime World\u201d) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on January\u00a013, 2006. Prime World is the parent company of Global Technology, Inc. (\u201cGlobal\u201d). Global was established in June 2002 in the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cPRC\u201d) and was acquired by Prime World on March\u00a030, 2006. Prime World also operates a division in Taiwan, which is qualified to do business in Taiwan and primarily manufactures transceivers and performs research and development activities.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur principal executive offices are located at 13139 Jess Pirtle Blvd., Sugar Land, TX 77478, and our telephone number is (281)\u00a0295-1800.

You should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in our Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. If any of the following risks actually occur, we may be unable to conduct our business as currently planned and our financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. In addition, the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nEpidemic diseases, such as COVID-19, or the perception of their effects, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation, or cash flows.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOutbreaks of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases, such as the recent COVID-19 or, historically, the Ebola virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or the H1N1 virus, could divert medical resources and priorities towards the treatment of that disease. Business disruptions could include disruptions or restrictions on our ability to travel or to distribute our products, as well as temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers and their contract manufacturers. Any disruption of our suppliers and their contract manufacturers or our customers would likely impact our sales and operating results. In addition, a significant outbreak of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict as coronavirus continues to spread around the world. In March 2020, we instituted travel restrictions and implemented sanitation and disinfection procedures to safeguard the health and safety of our employees which continue today. Recently, we began allowing certain employee travel, but continue strict sanitation procedures in our facilities.\u00a0\u00a0With increased vaccinations and the potential reduction of infections, we implemented procedures for a safe return to the office environment for all of our employees. However, even with these precautions, it is not possible to eliminate the risk of a widespread outbreak amongour employees and if such\u00a0an outbreak were to occur, it would likely have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, and our financial condition.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe spread of COVID-19 has also impacted our supply chain operations through restrictions, reduced capacity and shutdown of business activities by suppliers whom we rely on for sourcing components and materials and third-party partners whom we rely on for manufacturing, warehousing and logistics services. Currently, the suppliers who are responsible for most of our supply-chain constraints have begun the process of returning to normal operations and have expressed optimism that their deliveries in 2022 will return to normal.\u00a0In order to minimize the impact of these and any similar disruptions, we have added additional suppliers for many key components, where it is practical to do so.\u00a0 We believe that these additional suppliers will be able to augment our supply of needed components, although in some cases these new suppliers' materials are more expensive than the pre-existing suppliers so a switch to these alternate suppliers could have a negative impact on gross margins and profitability. However, this is uncertain and we also cannot predict if other suppliers could encounter similar difficulties. Any disruption resulting from similar events on a larger scale or over a prolonged period could cause significant delays in supply of needed components.\u00a0\u00a0It\u00a0would likely have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, and our financial condition.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough demand for many of our products has been strong in the short-term as subscribers seek more bandwidth, customers\u2019 purchasing decisions over the long-term may be impacted by the pandemic and its impact on the economy, which could in turn impact our revenue and results of operations.\n The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may materially impact our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations is therefore uncertain.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to Operating\u00a0Our Business\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe are dependent on our key customers for a significant portion of our revenue and the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from, any of our key customers would adversely impact our revenue and results of operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe generate much of our revenue from a limited number of customers. For each year ended \n2021, 2020 and 2019\n, our top ten customers represented 84.7%, 84.3%, and 88.1% of our revenue, respectively. In \n2021\n, ATX represented 25.6% of our revenue, Microsoft represented 14.1% of our revenue, and Cisco\u00a0represented 11.9% of our revenue. As a result, the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from any of our key customers would materially and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. We typically do not have long-term contracts with our customers and instead rely on recurring purchase orders. However, many of our current revenue expectations and forecasts reflect significant anticipated orders from a limited number of key customers. If our key customers do not continue to purchase our existing products or fail to purchase additional products from us, our revenue would decline and our results of operations would be adversely affected.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAdverse events affecting our key customers could also negatively affect our ability to retain their business and obtain new purchase orders, which could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. For example, in recent years, there has been consolidation among various network equipment manufacturers and this trend is expected to continue. We are unable to predict the impact that industry consolidation would have on our existing or potential customers. We may not be able to offset any potential decline in revenue arising from the consolidation of our existing customers with revenue from new customers or additional revenue from the merged company.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nCustomer demand is difficult to forecast accurately and, as a result, we may be unable to match production with customer demand.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe make planning and spending decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of product demand and customer requirements. Our products are typically purchased pursuant to individual purchase orders. While our customers may provide us with their demand forecasts, they are typically not contractually committed to buy any quantity of products beyond firm purchase orders. Furthermore, many of our customers may increase, decrease, cancel or delay purchase orders already in place without significant penalty. The short-term nature of commitments by our customers and the possibility of unexpected changes in demand for their products reduce our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements. On occasion, customers may require rapid increases in production, which can strain our resources, cause our manufacturing to be negatively impacted by materials shortages, necessitate more onerous procurement commitments and reduce our gross margin. We may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet the volume demands of our customers, or one or more of our suppliers may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our volume demands. If any of our major customers decrease, stop or delay purchasing our products for any reason, we will likely have excess manufacturing capacity or inventory and our business and results of operations would be harmed.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       14\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf our customers do not qualify our products for use on a timely basis, our results of operations may suffer.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nPrior to the sale of new products, our customers typically require us to \u201cqualify\u201d our products for use in their applications. At the successful completion of this qualification process, we refer to the resulting sales opportunity as a \u201cdesign win.\u201d Additionally, new customers often audit our manufacturing facilities and perform other evaluations during this qualification process. The qualification process involves product sampling and reliability testing and collaboration with our product management and engineering teams in the design and manufacturing stages. If we are unable to accurately predict the amount of time required to qualify our products with customers, or are unable to qualify our products with certain customers at all, then our ability to generate revenue could be delayed or our revenue would be lower than expected and we may not be able to recover the costs associated with the qualification process or with our product development efforts, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, due to rapid technological changes in our markets, a customer may cancel or modify a design project before we have qualified our product or begun volume manufacturing of a qualified product. It is unlikely that we would be able to recover the expenses for cancelled or unutilized custom design projects. Some of these unrecoverable expenses for cancelled or unutilized custom design projects may be significant. It is difficult to predict with any certainty whether our customers will delay or terminate product qualification or the frequency with which customers will cancel or modify their projects, but any such delay, cancellation or modification would have a negative effect on our results of operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOur ability to successfully qualify and scale capacity for new technologies and products is important to our ability to grow our business and market presence, and we may invest a significant amount to scale our capacity to meet potential demand from customers for our new technologies and products. If we are unable to qualify and sell any of our new products in volume, on time, or at all, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe must continually develop successful new products and enhance existing products, and if we fail to do so or if our release of new or enhanced products is delayed, our business may be harmed.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe markets for our products are characterized by frequent new product introductions, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards, all with an underlying pressure to reduce cost and meet stringent reliability and qualification requirements. Our future performance will depend on our successful development, introduction and market acceptance of new and enhanced products that address these challenges. If we are unable to make our new or enhanced products commercially available on a timely basis, we may lose existing and potential customers and our financial results would suffer.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, due to the costs and length of research, development and manufacturing process cycles, we may not recognize revenue from new products until long after such expenditures, if at all, and our margins may decrease if our costs are higher than expected, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough the length of our product development cycle varies widely by product and customer, it may take 18\u00a0months or longer before we receive our first order. As a result, we may incur significant expenses long before customers accept and purchase our products.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nProduct development delays may result from numerous factors, including:\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\u00a0\n \n\n\n \nmodification of product specifications and customer requirements;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\u00a0\n \n\n\n \nunanticipated engineering complexities;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\u00a0\n \n\n\n \ndifficulties in reallocating engineering resources and overcoming resource limitations; and\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\u00a0\n \n\n\n \nrapidly changing technology or competitive product requirements.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe introduction of new products by us or our competitors and other changes in our customer\u2019s demands could result in a slowdown in demand for our existing products and could result in a write-down in the value of our inventory. We have in the past experienced periodic fluctuations in demand for existing products and delays in new product development, and such fluctuations will likely occur in the future. To the extent we fail to qualify our products and obtain their approval for use, which we refer to as a design win, or experience product development delays for any reason, our competitive position would be adversely affected and our ability to grow our revenue would be impaired.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nFurthermore, our ability to enter a market with new products in a timely manner can be critical to our success because it is difficult to displace an existing supplier for a particular type of product once a customer has chosen a supplier, even if a later-to-market product provides better performance or cost efficiency.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe development of new, technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring frequent innovation, highly-skilled engineering and development personnel and significant capital, as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify, develop, manufacture, market or support new or enhanced products successfully or on a timely basis. Further, we cannot assure you that our new products will gain market acceptance or that we will be able to respond effectively to product introductions by competitors, technological changes or emerging industry standards. We also may not be able to develop the underlying core technologies necessary to create new products and enhancements, license these technologies from third parties, or remain competitive in our markets.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       15\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur revenues, growth rates and operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly as a result of factors that are outside our control, which could adversely impact our operating results. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOur revenues, growth rates and operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of factors that are outside our control. We may not achieve similar revenues, growth rates or operating results in future periods. Our revenues, growth rates and operating results for any prior quarterly or annual period should not be relied upon as any indication of our future revenues, growth rates or operating results. The timing of order placement, size of orders and satisfaction of contractual customer acceptance criteria, changes in the pricing of our products due to competitive pressures as well as order or shipment delays or deferrals, with respect to our products, may cause material fluctuations in revenues. Our lengthy sales cycle, which may extend to more than one year, may cause our revenues and operating results to vary from period to period and it may be difficult to predict the timing and amount of any variation. Delays or deferrals in purchasing decisions by our customers may increase as we develop new or enhanced products for existing and new markets, including automotive and biotechnology markets. Our current and anticipated future dependence on a small number of customers increases the revenue impact of each such customer\u2019s decision to delay or defer purchases from us, or decision not to purchase products from us. Our expense levels in the future will be based, in large part, on our expectations regarding future revenue sources and, as a result, operating results for any quarterly period in which anticipated material orders fail to occur, or are delayed or deferred, could be significantly harmed.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we encounter manufacturing problems, we may lose sales and damage our customer relationships.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe may experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations. These and other factors may cause less than acceptable yields at our facility. Manufacturing yields depend on a number of factors, including the quality of available raw materials, the degradation or change in equipment calibration and the rate and timing of the introduction of new products. Changes in manufacturing processes required as a result of changes in product specifications, changing customer needs and the introduction of new product lines may significantly reduce our manufacturing yields, resulting in low or negative margins on those products. In addition, we use our MBE, fabrication process to make our lasers, in addition to MOCVD, the technique most commonly used in optical manufacturing by communications optics vendors, and our MBE fabrication process relies on custom-manufactured equipment. If our MBE or MOCVD fabrication facility in Sugar Land, Texas were to be damaged or destroyed for any reason, our manufacturing process would be severely disrupted. Any such manufacturing problems would likely delay product shipments to our customers. We may also experience delays in production, typically in February, during the Lunar New Year holiday when our facilities in China and Taiwan are closed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGiven the high fixed costs associated with our vertically integrated business, a reduction in demand for our products will likely adversely impact our gross profits and our results of operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe have a high fixed cost base due to our vertically integrated business model, including the fact that \n2,178 of our employees as of \nDecember 31, 2021\n were employed in manufacturing and research and development operations. We may not be able to adjust these fixed costs quickly to adapt to rapidly changing market conditions. Our gross profit and gross margin are greatly affected by our sales volume and volatility on a quarterly basis and the corresponding absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses. In addition, because we are a vertically integrated manufacturer, insufficient demand for our products may subject us to the risk of high inventory carrying costs and increased inventory obsolescence. Given our vertical integration, the rate at which we turn inventory has historically been low when compared to our cost of sales. We do not expect this to change significantly in the future and believe that we will have to maintain a relatively high level of inventory compared to our cost of sales. As a result, we continue to expect to have a significant amount of working capital invested in inventory. We may be required to write down inventory costs in the future and our high inventory costs may have an adverse effect on our gross profits and our results of operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIncreasing costs and shifts in product mix may adversely impact our gross margins.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOur gross margins on individual products and among products fluctuate over each product\u2019s life cycle. Our overall gross margins have fluctuated from period to period as a result of shifts in product mix, the introduction of new products, decreases in average selling prices and our ability to reduce product costs, and these fluctuations are expected to continue in the future. We may not be able to accurately predict our product mix from period to period, and as a result we may not be able to forecast accurately our overall gross margins. The rate of increase in our costs and expenses may exceed the rate of increase in our revenue, either of which would materially and adversely affect our business, our results of operations and our financial condition.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       16\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur financial results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter due to a number of factors, which may lead to volatility in our stock price.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOur quarterly revenue and operating results have varied in the past and will likely continue to vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter. This variability may lead to volatility in our stock price as research analysts and investors respond to these quarterly fluctuations.

In addition, a significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in nature due to our internal manufacturing, research and development, sales and general administrative efforts. Any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations. For these reasons, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indicator of future performance. Moreover, our operating results may not meet our announced guidance or the expectations of research analysts or investors, in which case the price of our common stock could decrease significantly. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully address these risks.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       17\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe depend on key personnel to develop and maintain our technology and manage our business in a rapidly changing market.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe continued services of our executive officers and other key engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and support personnel is essential to our success.

We do not have key person life insurance policies covering any of our employees.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo implement our business plan, we also intend to hire additional employees in expanding areas of our business. Our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled employees is a critical factor in our success. Competition for highly skilled personnel is intense. We may not be successful in attracting, assimilating or retaining qualified personnel to satisfy our current or future needs. Our ability to develop, manufacture and sell our products, and thus our financial condition and results of operations, would be adversely affected if we are unable to retain existing personnel or hire additional qualified personnel.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers and any supply interruption could have an adverse effect on our business.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials and components used in our products. Some of these suppliers could disrupt our business if they stop, decrease or delay shipments or if the materials or components they ship have quality or reliability issues. Some of the raw materials and components we use in our products are available only from a sole source or have been qualified only from a single supplier. Furthermore, other than our current suppliers, there are a limited number of entities from whom we could obtain certain materials and components. We may also face shortages if we experience increased demand for materials or components beyond what our qualified suppliers can deliver. Our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of critical materials or components could adversely affect our ability to meet demand for our products, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. Also see the section above on the COVID-19 pandemic for details related to global supply chain disruptions.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe typically have not entered into long-term agreements with our suppliers and, therefore, our suppliers could stop supplying materials and components to us at any time or fail to supply adequate quantities of materials or components to us on a timely basis. It is difficult, costly, time consuming and, on short notice, sometimes impossible for us to identify and qualify new suppliers. Our customers generally restrict our ability to change the components in our products. For more critical components, any changes may require repeating the entire qualification process. Our reliance on a limited number of suppliers or a single qualified vendor may result in delivery and quality problems, and reduced control over product pricing, reliability and performance.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur products could contain defects that may cause us to incur significant costs or result in a loss of customers.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOur products are complex and undergo quality testing as well as formal qualification by our customers. Our customers\u2019 testing procedures are limited to evaluating our products under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios and over varying amounts of time. For various reasons, such as the occurrence of performance problems that are unforeseeable in testing or that are detected only when products age or are operated under peak stress conditions, our products may fail to perform as expected long after customer acceptance. Failures could result from faulty components or design, problems in manufacturing or other unforeseen reasons. Any such failures could delay product shipments to our customers or result in a loss of customers. Our products are typically embedded in, or deployed in conjunction with, our customers\u2019 products, which incorporate a variety of components, modules and subsystems and may be expected to interoperate with modules produced by third parties. As a result, not all defects are immediately detectable and when problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. We face this risk because our products are widely deployed in many demanding environments and applications worldwide. In addition, we may in certain circumstances honor warranty claims after the warranty has expired or for problems not covered by warranty to maintain customer relationships. Any significant product failure could result in litigation, damages, repair costs and lost future sales of the affected product and other products, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems, all of which would harm our business. Although we carry product liability insurance, this insurance may not adequately cover our costs arising from defects in our products or otherwise.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       18\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur ability to use our net operating losses and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     \u00a0\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of \n\n      December 31, 2021\n      \n, \n\n\nwe had U.S. accumulated net operating losses, or NOLs, of approximately $104.8 million, federal and state research and development credits (\u201cR&D credits\u201d) of $9.9 million, business interest expense of $13.5 million and foreign tax credits of $4.6\u00a0million for U.S. federal income tax purposes. \nOur ability to use our net operating losses, or NOLs, to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations which could subject our business to higher tax liability. We may be limited in the portion of NOL carryforwards that we can use in the future to offset taxable income for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes, and federal tax credits to offset federal tax liabilities. Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, limit the use of NOLs and tax credits after a cumulative change in corporate ownership of more than 50% occurs within a three-year period. The statutes place a formula limit on how much NOLs and tax credits a corporation can use in a tax year after a change in ownership. Avoiding an ownership change is generally beyond our control. Although the ownership changes we experienced in the past and in the year ended \n\n      December 31, 2021\n      \n would not have prevented us from using all NOLs and tax credits accumulated before such ownership changes, assuming we were otherwise able to do so, we could experience another ownership change that might limit our use of NOLs and tax credits in the future. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, NOLs from tax years that began after December 31, 2017 do not expire, but NOLs from tax years that began before January 1, 2018 expire after 20 years. Further, under the Tax Act, although the treatment of tax losses generated in taxable years ending before December 31, 2017 has generally not changed, tax losses generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 may offset no more than 80% of taxable income annually. Accordingly, if we generate NOLs after the tax year ended December 31, 2017, we might have to pay more federal income taxes in a subsequent year as a result of the 80% taxable income limitation than we would have had to pay under the law in effect before the Tax Act.\u00a0 Also, any foreign NOLs (for example NOLs in our China and Taiwan jurisdictions) are subject to different NOL expirations, generally shorter than in the US.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     \u00a0\n   \n\n\n\n\nFuture acquisitions may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAs part of our business strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of companies that we believe could enhance or complement our current product portfolio, augment our technology roadmap or diversify our revenue base. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including:\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \ndifficulties integrating the acquired business;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \nunanticipated costs, capital expenditures or liabilities or changes related to research in progress and product development;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \ndiversion of financial and management resources from our existing business;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \ndifficulties integrating the business relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired business with our existing business relationships;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \nrisks associated with entering markets in which we have little or no prior experience; and\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \npotential loss of key employees, particularly those of the acquired organizations.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAcquisitions may also result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets subject to potential impairment in the future, adversely affecting our operating results. We may not achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition if we fail to evaluate it properly, and we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate. A failure to evaluate and execute an acquisition appropriately or otherwise adequately address these risks may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFuture divestitures may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe frequently evaluate our portfolio of products and may consider divestitures or exits of businesses that we no longer believe to be an appropriate strategic fit. Divestitures may adversely impact our results if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested products or businesses, or mitigate overhead costs allocated to those businesses. Furthermore, the divestitures could adversely affect our ongoing business operations, including by enhancing our competitors' positions or reducing customer confidence in our ongoing brand and products.\u00a0 The inability to effectively and efficiently manage divestitures with the results we expect or in the timeframe we anticipate could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\nOur future results of operations may be subject to volatility as a result of exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\n\n\nWe have significant foreign currency exposure and are affected by fluctuations among the U.S. dollar, the Chinese Renminbi, or RMB, and the New Taiwan dollar, or NT dollar, because a substantial portion of our business is conducted in China and Taiwan. Our sales, raw materials, components and capital expenditures are denominated in U.S. dollars, RMB and NT dollars in varying amounts.\n\n\nForeign currency fluctuations may adversely affect our revenue and our costs and expenses, and hence our results of operations. The value of the NT dollar or the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and be affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions. The RMB currency is no longer being pegged solely to the value of the U.S. dollar. In the long term, the RMB may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar, depending upon the fluctuation of the basket of currencies against which it is currently valued, or it may be permitted to enter into a full float, which may also result in a significant appreciation or depreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar. In addition, our currency exchange variations may be magnified by Chinese exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign currency.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedging transactions may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       19\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events could harm our operations.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOur operations in the U.S., China and Taiwan could be subject to significant risk of natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, typhoons, flooding and tornadoes, as well as other catastrophic events, such as epidemics, terrorist attacks or wars. For example, our corporate headquarters and wafer fabrication facility in Sugar Land, Texas is located near the Gulf of Mexico, an area that is susceptible to hurricanes. We use a proprietary MBE laser manufacturing process that requires customized equipment, and this process is currently conducted and located solely at our wafer fabrication facility in Sugar Land, Texas, such that a natural disaster, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event that affects that facility would materially harm our operations. In addition, our manufacturing facility in Taipei, Taiwan, is susceptible to typhoons and earthquakes, and our manufacturing facility in Ningbo, China, has from time to time, suffered electrical outages. Any disruption in our manufacturing facilities arising from these and other natural disasters or other catastrophic events could cause significant delays in the production or shipment of our products until we are able to shift production to different facilities or arrange for third parties to manufacture our products. We may not be able to obtain alternate capacity on favorable terms or at all. Our property insurance coverage with respect to natural disaster is limited and is subject to deductible and coverage limits. Such coverage may not be adequate or continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms. The occurrence of any of these circumstances may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe are subject to export and import control laws, trade regulations and other trade requirements that limit which products we sell and where and to whom we sell our products. Specifically, the Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of Commerce is responsible for regulating the export of most commercial items that are so called dual-use goods that may have both commercial and military applications. Our products are primarily classified under Export Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs 5A991 EAR99. Export Control Classification requirements are dependent upon an item\u2019s technical characteristics, and dictate the destination, end-use, end-user, and other activities of the end-user. Should the regulations applicable to our products change, or the restrictions applicable to countries to which we ship our products change, then the export of our products to such countries could be restricted. As a result, our ability to export or sell our products to certain countries could be restricted, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nFurthermore, due to the recent administration change in the U.S., and the appointment of a new United States Trade Representative, new policy priorities may lead to additional or new import risks affecting the flow of our products into the U.S. Changes in our products or any change in export or import regulations or related legislation, shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in delayed or decreased sales of our products to existing or potential customers. In such event, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur business could be negatively impacted as a result of shareholder activism. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIn recent years, shareholder activists have become involved in numerous public companies. Shareholder activists frequently propose to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction, and operations of the Company. We may in the future become subject to such shareholder activity and demands. Such demands may disrupt our business and divert the attention of our management and employees, and any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities, be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, all of which could adversely affect our business. In addition, actions of activist shareholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe unfavorable outcome of any pending or future litigation or administrative action and expenses incurred in connection with litigation could result in financial losses or harm to our business. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have been, and in the future may be, subject to legal actions in the ordinary course of our operations, both domestically and internationally. There can be no assurances as to the favorable outcome of any litigation. In addition it can be costly to defend litigation and these costs could negatively impact our financial results. As further described in that section, subsequent derivative actions and securities class actions have since been filed.\u00a0 This litigation and any other such litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       20\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Future Financing\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur indebtedness and liabilities could limit the cash flow available for our operations, expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of \n\n    December 31, 2021\n    \n, we had approximately $141.6 million of consolidated indebtedness.

In addition, our existing Credit Facility with Truist Bank, contains, and any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain, financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate our business, raise capital or make payments under our other indebtedness. If we fail to comply with these covenants or to make payments under our indebtedness when due, then we would be in default under that indebtedness, which could, in turn, result in that and our other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       21\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur loan agreements contain restrictive covenants that may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe have lending arrangements with several financial institutions, including loan agreements with Truist Bank in the U.S., equipment finance agreements with Chailease Finance Co., Ltd. in Taiwan and credit facilities\u00a0with China Merchants Bank Co. Ltd., Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Co., Ltd and China Zheshang Bank Co., Ltd. in China. Our loan agreements governing our long-term debt obligations in the U.S. and Asia contain certain financial and operating covenants that limit our management\u2019s discretion with respect to certain business matters. Among other things, these covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios and restrict our ability to incur additional debt, create liens or other encumbrances, change the nature of our business, sell or otherwise dispose of assets and merge or consolidate with other entities. In addition, the Indenture governing the Notes contains covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue disqualified stock; and (ii) create or incur liens.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThese restrictions may limit our flexibility in responding to business opportunities, competitive developments and adverse economic or industry conditions. Any failure by us or our subsidiaries to comply with these agreements could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, our obligations under our loan agreements with Truist Bank are secured by our accounts receivable, inventory, intellectual property, and all business assets except real estate and equipment. Our credit facilities with Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Co., Ltd. and China Zheshang Bank Co., Ltd. are secured by real estate. A breach of any of covenants under our loan agreements, or a failure to pay interest or indebtedness when due under any of our credit facilities could result in a variety of adverse consequences, including the acceleration of our indebtedness.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may not be able to obtain additional capital when desired, on favorable terms or at all.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe operate in a market that makes our prospects difficult to evaluate and, to remain competitive, we will be required to make continued investments in capital equipment, facilities and technological improvements. We expect that substantial capital will be required to expand our manufacturing capacity and fund working capital for anticipated growth. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or otherwise have the capital resources to meet our future capital needs, we may need additional financing to implement our business strategy, which includes:\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\u00a0\n \n\n\n \nexpansion of research and development;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \nexpansion of manufacturing capabilities;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\u00a0\n \n\n\n \nhiring of additional technical, sales and other personnel; and\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\u00a0\n \n\n\n \nacquisitions of complementary businesses.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIf we raise additional funds through the issuance of our common stock or convertible securities, the ownership interests of our stockholders could be significantly diluted.

Additional financing may not, however, be available on terms favorable to us, or at all, if and when needed, and our ability to fund our operations, take advantage of unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance our infrastructure or respond to competitive pressures could be significantly limited. If we cannot raise required capital when needed, including under our Registration Statement filed with the SEC in October 2019, effective January 2020, we may be unable to meet the demands of existing and prospective customers, adversely affecting our sales and market opportunities and consequently our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       22\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to Data Breaches and Network Infrastructures\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nData breaches and cyberattacks could compromise our operations, our customers\u2019 operations, or the operations of our contract manufacturers upon whom we rely, and cause significant damage to our business and reputation.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nCyberattacks have become more prevalent and much harder to detect and defend against. Companies, including companies in our industry, have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyberattacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to their systems or to deny access and disrupt their systems and operations. These threats can come from a variety of sources, ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker to a state-sponsored attack. Cyber threats may be generic, or they may be custom-crafted against our information systems.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we and our data center customers maintain sensitive data on our respective networks, including intellectual property, employee personal information and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our customers and business partners. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business and reputation. Despite our implementation of network security measures, our network and storage applications have been\u00a0subject to computer viruses, ransomware and other forms of cyber terrorism.\n\n\n\n    \u00a0\n  \n\n\n\n\nAlso, despite our implementation of security measures, we are not able to guarantee that we can prevent unauthorized access by hackers or breaches\u00a0due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. Our customers\u2019 network and storage applications may be subject to similar disruptions. It is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused by such incidents. Data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of our information, employee information or intellectual property could compromise our business, trade secrets and other sensitive business information, any of which could result in legal action against us, exposure of our intellectual property to our competitors, damages, fines and other adverse effects. A data security breach could also lead to public exposure of personal information of our employees, customers and others. Any such theft, loss or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nsecurity costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Cyberattacks, such as computer viruses or other forms of cyber terrorism, have disrupted access to some of\u00a0our network or storage applications. In past incidents we have been able to recover quickly without material financial impact, however such\u00a0disruptions in the future may result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or delays or additional costs to produce and ship our products. Data security breaches involving our data center customers could affect their financial condition and ability to continue to purchase our products. Further, cyberattacks may cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. These incidents could also subject us to liability, expose us to significant expense and cause significant harm to our reputation and business.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \u00a0\n  \n\n\nWe may be subject to disruptions or failures in information technology systems and network infrastructures that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and network infrastructures to operate our business. A disruption, infiltration or failure of our information technology systems as a result of software or hardware malfunctions, system implementations or upgrades, computer viruses, third-party security breaches, employee error, theft or misuse, malfeasance, power disruptions, natural disasters or accidents could cause a breach of data security, loss of intellectual property and critical data and the release and misappropriation of sensitive competitive information and partner, customer, and employee personal data. Any of these events could harm our competitive position, result in a loss of customer confidence, cause us to incur significant costs to remedy any damages and ultimately materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to International Trade and Operations\n\n\n\n    \u00a0\n  \n\n\n\n\nChanges in U.S. and international trade policies, particularly regarding China, may materially and adversely impact our business and operating results. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe U.S. government has made statements and taken certain actions that have led and may lead to further changes to U.S. and international trade policies, including imposing additional\u00a0tariffs on certain products manufactured in China. Since the beginning of 2018, there has been increasing rhetoric, in some cases coupled with legislative, administrative, or executive action, from several U.S. and foreign leaders regarding the possibility of instituting tariffs on the foreign imports of certain materials.\u00a0Five rounds of U.S. tariffs on imports from China (respectively the \u201cU.S. Tariffs on China Imports\u201d) went into effect on July 2018, August 2018, September 2018, September 2019, and February 2020. A limited number of our products that are of Chinese origin are currently subject to the U.S. Tariffs on China Imports.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nDespite an administration change in the U.S., and the appointment of a new United States Trade Representative, it is unknown whether and to what extent new tariffs (or other new laws or regulations) will be adopted, or the effect that any such actions would have on us or our industry. A significant portion of our manufacturing operations are based in Ningbo, China; therefore, there could be material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and/or cash flow if any new tariffs, legislation and/or regulations are implemented, or if existing trade agreements are renegotiated or if China or other affected countries take further retaliatory trade actions.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nFurthermore, the implementation of trade tariffs both globally and between the U.S. and China specifically carries the risk of negatively impacting China\u2019s overall economic condition, which could have negative repercussions on our business. Bilateral tariffs could cause a decrease in the sales of our products to customers located in China or other customers selling to Chinese end users, further impacting our business.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nSignificant changes to existing international trade agreements could also lead to sourcing or logistics disruption resulting from import delays or the imposition of increased tariffs on our sourcing partners.\u00a0 For example, the Chinese government could, among other things, require the use of local suppliers, compel companies that do business in China to partner with local companies, and otherwise provide government incentives or subsidies to government-backed local customers to buy from local suppliers. Changes in, and responses to, U.S. trade policy could reduce the competitiveness of our products and thus cause our sales and revenues to drop, which could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       23\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe face a variety of risks associated with our international sales and operations.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe currently derive, and expect to continue to derive, a significant portion of our revenue from sales to international customers. In \n2021, 2020 and 2019\n, 25.5%, 25.4%, and 18.8% of our revenue was derived from sales that occurred outside of North America, respectively. In addition, a significant portion of our manufacturing operations is based in Ningbo, China and Taipei, Taiwan.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTrade-related government actions, by the U.S., China or other countries that impose barriers or restrictions that would impact our ability to sell or ship products to customers or potential customers may have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict the actions government entities may take in this context and may be unable to quickly offset or effectively react to government actions that restrict our ability to sell to certain customers or in certain jurisdictions. Government actions that affect our customers' ability to sell products or access critical elements of their supply chains may result in a decreased demand for their products, which may consequently reduce their demand for our products.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur international revenue and operations are subject to a number of material risks, including:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n-\n\n\n \ndifficulties in staffing, managing and supporting operations in more than one country;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2011\n\n\n \ndifficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \nfewer legal protections for intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \nforeign and U.S. taxation issues and international trade barriers, including the adoption or expansion of governmental trade tariffs, export controls, and fluctuating changes to end use and user rules;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \ndifficulties in obtaining any necessary governmental authorizations for the export of our products to certain foreign jurisdictions;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \nfluctuations in foreign economies;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \nfluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \ntrade and travel restrictions;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \ndomestic and international economic or political changes, hostilities and other disruptions in regions where we currently operate or may operate in the future;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \ndifficulties and increased expenses in complying with a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, regulations, and trade standards, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and various modifications by the Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of Commerce to export policy; and\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \ndifferent and changing legal and regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate or may operate in the future.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nNegative developments in any of these factors in China or Taiwan or other countries could result in a reduction in demand for our products, the cancellation or delay of orders already placed, difficulties in producing and delivering our products, threats to our intellectual property, difficulty in collecting receivables, and a higher cost of doing business. Although we maintain certain compliance programs throughout the Company, violations of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations may result in criminal or civil sanctions, including material monetary fines, penalties and other costs against us or our employees, and may have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOur business operations conducted in China and Taiwan are important to our success. A substantial portion of our property, plant and equipment is located in China and Taiwan. We expect to make further investments in China and Taiwan in the future. Therefore, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects are subject to economic, political, legal, and social events and developments in China and Taiwan. Factors affecting military, political or economic conditions in China and Taiwan could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the market price and the liquidity of our common shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       24\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property Matters\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we fail to protect, or incur significant costs in defending, our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOur success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and unfair competition laws, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to establish and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We have applied for patents in the U.S. and in other foreign countries, some of which have been issued. In addition, we have registered certain trademarks in the U.S. We cannot guarantee that our pending applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities. Moreover, our existing and future patents and trademarks may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary rights or may be held invalid or unenforceable in court. A failure to obtain patents or trademark registrations or a successful challenge to our patents and trademark registrations in the U.S. or other foreign countries may limit our ability to protect the intellectual property rights that these patent and trademark registrations intended to cover.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nPolicing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation, unauthorized use or other infringement of our intellectual property rights. Further, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights from misappropriation or other infringement in foreign countries where we have not applied for patent protections and where effective patent, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws may be unavailable, or may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as U.S. law. We may seek to secure comparable intellectual property protections in other countries. However, the level of protection afforded by patent and other laws in other countries may not be comparable to that afforded in the U.S.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe also attempt to protect our intellectual property, including our trade secrets and know-how, through the use of trade secret and other intellectual property laws, and contractual provisions. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and independent consultants. We also use non-disclosure agreements with other third parties who may have access to our proprietary technologies and information. Such measures, however, provide only limited protection, and there can be no assurance that our confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements will not be breached, especially after our employees end their employment, and that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known by competitors or that we will have adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of proprietary information. Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer our products or portions of our products, otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property, or may independently develop similar or equivalent trade secrets or know-how. If we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, or if such intellectual property and proprietary rights are infringed, misappropriated or duplicated, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially harmed.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIn the future, we may need to take legal actions to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or from otherwise gaining access to our technology. Protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights and determining their validity and scope could result in significant litigation costs and require significant time and attention from our technical and management personnel, which could significantly harm our business. We may not prevail in such proceedings, and an adverse outcome may adversely impact our competitive advantage or otherwise harm our financial condition and our business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may be involved in intellectual property disputes in the future, which could divert management\u2019s attention, cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling or using the challenged technology.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nParticipants in the markets in which we sell our products have experienced frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. While we have a policy in place that is designed to reduce the risk of infringement of intellectual property rights of others and we have conducted a limited review of other companies\u2019 relevant patents, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us. We cannot be certain that our products would not be found infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. Regardless of their merit, responding to such claims can be time consuming, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and may cause us to incur significant expenses. Intellectual property claims against us could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \nobtain from a third party claiming infringement a license to the relevant technology, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \nstop manufacturing, selling, incorporating or using our products that use the challenged intellectual property;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \npay substantial monetary damages; or\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \nexpend significant resources to redesign the products that use the technology and to develop non-infringing technology.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAny of these actions could result in a substantial reduction in our revenue and could result in losses over an extended period of time.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIn any potential intellectual property dispute, our customers could also become the target of litigation. Because we often indemnify our customers for intellectual property claims made against them with respect to our products, any claims against our customers could trigger indemnification claims against us. These obligations could result in substantial expenses such as legal expenses, damages for past infringement or royalties for future use. Any indemnity claim could also adversely affect our relationships with our customers and result in substantial costs to us.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       25\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Operations in China\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOur business operations conducted in China are critical to our success. A total of $97.7 million, $85.2 million, and $83.3 million or 46.2%, 36.3%, and 43.6%, of our revenue in the years ended \nDecember 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\n was attributable to our product manufactured at our plant in China, respectively. Additionally, a substantial portion of our property, plant and equipment, 42.2% 40.6%, and 37.1% as of \nDecember 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\n, was located in China, respectively. We expect to make further investments in China in the foreseeable future. Therefore, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects are to a significant degree subject to economic, political, legal, and social events and developments in China.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAdverse changes in economic and political policies in China, or Chinese laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on business conditions and the overall economic growth of China, which could adversely affect our business.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the level of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. The Chinese economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy. Despite reforms, the government continues to exercise significant control over China\u2019s economic growth by way of the allocation of resources, control over foreign currency-denominated obligations and monetary policy and provision of preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, the laws, regulations and legal requirements in China, including the laws that apply to foreign-invested enterprises, or FIEs, are subject to frequent changes. The interpretation and enforcement of such laws is uncertain. Protections of intellectual property rights and confidentiality in China may not be as effective as in the U.S. or other countries or regions with more developed legal systems. Any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. Any adverse changes to these laws, regulations and legal requirements or their interpretation or enforcement could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nFurthermore, while China\u2019s economy has experienced rapid growth in the past 20\u00a0years, growth has been uneven across different regions, among various economic sectors and over time. China has also in the past and may in the future experience economic downturns due to, for example, government austerity measures, changes in government policies relating to capital spending, limitations placed on the ability of commercial banks to make loans, reduced levels of exports and international trade, inflation, lack of financial liquidity, stock market volatility and global economic conditions. Any of these developments could contribute to a decline in business and consumer spending in addition to other adverse market conditions, which could adversely affect our business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe turnover of direct labor in manufacturing industries in China is high, which could adversely affect our production, shipments and results of operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nEmployee turnover of direct labor in the manufacturing sector in China is extremely high and retention of such personnel is a challenge to companies located in or with operations in China. Although direct labor costs do not represent a high proportion of our overall manufacturing costs, direct labor is required for the manufacture of our products. If our direct labor turnover rates are higher than we expect, or we otherwise fail to adequately manage our direct labor turnover rates, then our results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nChinese regulation of loans to and direct investment by offshore holding companies in China entities may delay or prevent us from making loans or additional capital contributions to our China subsidiary.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAny loans that we wish to make to our China subsidiary are subject to Chinese regulations and approvals. For example, any loans to our China subsidiary to finance their activities cannot exceed statutory limits, must be registered with State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, or its local counterpart, and must be approved by the relevant government authorities. Any capital contributions to our China subsidiary must be approved by the Ministry of Commerce or its local counterpart. In addition, under Circular 142, our China subsidiary, as a FIE, may not be able to convert our capital contributions to them into RMB for equity investments or acquisitions in China.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to our future loans or capital contributions to our China subsidiary. If we fail to receive such registrations or approvals, our ability to capitalize our China subsidiary may be negatively affected, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and ability to fund and expand our business.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOur China subsidiary is subject to Chinese labor laws and regulations, and Chinese labor laws may increase our operating costs in China.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nChinese labor laws and regulations provide certain protections for our employees located in China, and changes to those labor laws and regulations may increase our costs and reduce our flexibility. The China Labor Contract Law, which went into effect in 2008, together with its implementing rules, provides increased rights to Chinese employees compared to prior employment laws in China. Under the rules under the China Labor Contract Law, the probation period varies depending on contract terms and the employment contract can only be terminated during the probation period for cause upon three days\u2019 notice. Additionally, an employer may not be able to terminate a contract during the probation period on the grounds of a material change of circumstances or a mass layoff. The law also has specific provisions on conditions when an employer has to sign an employment contract with open-ended terms. If an employer fails to enter into an open-ended contract in certain circumstances, the employer must pay the employee twice their monthly wage beginning from the time the employer should have executed an open-ended contract. Additionally, an employer must pay severance for nearly all terminations, including when an employer decides not to renew a fixed-term contract. Any further changes to these laws may increase our costs and reduce our flexibility.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       26\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOur stock price has been and is likely to be volatile.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe market price of our common stock has been and is likely to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, among other things, the risk factors described in this section of this Form 10-K, and other factors beyond our control, such as fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us. For example, announcements made by competitors regarding factors influencing their business may cause fluctuations in the valuation of companies throughout our industry, including fluctuations in the valuation of our stock.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIn the past, many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We have been and may become the target of this type of litigation in the future.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur charter documents, stock incentive plans and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws and our stock incentive plans contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include:\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2011\n\n\n \nproviding for a classified board of directors with staggered, three-year terms;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2011\n\n\n \nnot providing for cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \nauthorizing our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock rights senior to those of common stock;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \nlimiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \nrequiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals; and\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \nchange of control provisions in our stock incentive plans, and the individual stock option agreements, which provide that a change of control may accelerate the vesting of the stock options and equity awards issued under such plans.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section\u00a0203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding common stock, from engaging in certain business combinations without the approval of substantially all of our stockholders for a certain period of time.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThese and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation includes a forum selection clause, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i)\u00a0any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii)\u00a0any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company's stockholders, (iii)\u00a0any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws, or (iv)\u00a0any action asserting a claim against the Company governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision will not apply to claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 but will apply to other state and federal law claims including actions arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder). Section\u00a022 of the Securities Act of 1933, however, creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act of 1933 or the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a forum selection provision as written in connection with claims arising under the Securities Act of 1933. This forum selection provision in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation may limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us. It is also possible that a court could rule that such a provision is inapplicable or unenforceable.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       27\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ", "item1a": ">Item 1A.\n\n\n \nRisk Factors\n \n\n\n \n14\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nItem 1B.\n \n\n\n \nUnresolved Staff Comments\n \n\n\n \n28\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nItem 2.\n \n\n\n \nProperties\n \n\n\n \n28\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nItem 3.\n \n\n\n \nLegal Proceedings\n \n\n\n \n28\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nItem 4.\n \n\n\n \nMine Safety Disclosure\n \n\n\n \n28\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPart II\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n29\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nItem 5.\n \n\n\n \nMarket for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\n \n\n\n \n29\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nItem 6.\n \n\n\n \n[Reserved]\n \n\n\n \n30\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nItem 7.\n \n\n\n \nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \n\n\n \n30\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nItem 7A.\n \n\n\n \nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n \n\n\n \n47\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nItem 8.\n \n\n\n \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n \n\n\n \n48\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nItem 9.\n \n\n\n \nChanges in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\n \n\n\n \n48\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nItem 9A.\n \n\n\n \nControls and Procedures\n \n\n\n \n48\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nItem 9B.\n \n\n\n \nOther Information\n \n\n\n \n51\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nItem 9C\n \n\n\n \nDisclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections\n \n\n\n55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPart III\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n52\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nItem 10.\n \n\n\n \nDirectors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\n \n\n\n \n52\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nItem 11.\n \n\n\n \nExecutive Compensation\n \n\n\n \n52\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nItem 12.\n \n\n\n \nSecurity Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters\n \n\n\n \n52\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nItem 13.\n \n\n\n \nCertain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\n \n\n\n \n52\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nItem 14.\n \n\n\n \nPrincipal Accounting Fees and Services\n \n\n\n \n52\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPart IV\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n53\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nItem 15.\n \n\n\n \nExhibits, Financial Statements Schedules\n \n\n\n \n53\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nItem 16.\n \n\n\n \nForm 10-K Summary\n \n\n\n \n53\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSignatures\n \n\n\n \n60\n \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        2\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n    \u00a0\n  \n\n\nForward-Looking Information\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K (\"Form 10-K\") contains forward-looking statements that are based on our management\u2019s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management, including statements appearing under the heading, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d.

For a discussion of the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, please refer to Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, as amended.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOverview\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe are a leading, vertically integrated provider of fiber-optic networking products. We target four networking end-markets: internet data centers, CATV, telecom and FTTH. We design and manufacture a range of optical communications products at varying levels of integration, from components, subassemblies and modules to complete turn-key equipment. In designing products for our customers, we begin with the fundamental building blocks of lasers and laser components. From these foundational products, we design and manufacture a wide range of products to meet our customers\u2019 needs and specifications, and such products differ from each other by their end market, intended use and level of integration. We are primarily focused on the higher-performance segments within the internet data center, CATV, telecom and FTTH markets which increasingly demand faster connectivity and innovation. Our vertically integrated manufacturing model provides us several advantages, including rapid product development, fast response times to customer requests and control over product quality and manufacturing costs.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe four end markets we target are all driven by significant bandwidth demand fueled by the growth of network-connected devices, video traffic, cloud computing and online social networking. Within the internet data center market, we benefit from the increasing use of higher-capacity optical networking technology as a replacement for copper cables, particularly as speeds reach 10\u00a0Gbps and above, as well as the movement to open internet data center architectures and the increasing use of in-house equipment design among leading internet companies. Within the CATV market, we benefit from a number of ongoing trends including the move to higher bandwidth networks among CATV service providers and the outsourcing of system design among CATV networking equipment companies. In the FTTH market, we benefit from continuing PON deployments and system upgrades among telecom service providers. In the telecom market, we benefit from deployment of new high-speed fiber-optic networks by telecom network operators, including 5G networks.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIn \n2021, 2020 and 2019\n, our revenue was $211.57 million, $234.6 million, and $190.9 million and our gross margin was 17.8%, 21.5%, and 24.2%. We have grown our annual revenue at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 16.0% between 2011 and \n2021\n. In the years ended \nDecember 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\n, we had net loss of $53.7 million, $58.5 million, and $66.0 million, respectively. At \nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020\n, our accumulated deficit was $142.2 million and $88.5 million, respectively. In \n2021\n, we earned 46.1% of our total revenue from the internet data center market, and 44.6% of our total revenue from the CATV market.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe sell our products to leading OEMs in the CATV, telecom, and FTTH markets as well as internet data center operators. In \n2021\n, revenue from the internet data center market, CATV market, telecom market and FTTH markets provided 46.1%, 44.6%, 7.7%, and 0.5% of our revenue, respectively, compared to73.9%, 16.2%, 9.0%, and 0.0% of our \n2020\n revenue, respectively. In \n2021\n, our key customers in the data center market included, Microsoft, a US based large datacenter operator and a US based NEM company. In \n2021\n,\u00a0\n2020\n, and \n2019\n, Microsoft accounted for 25.6%, 38.3%, and 32.2% of our revenue, the US based large datacenter operator accounted for 8.3%. 8.0%, and 0.4% of our revenue, and the US based NEM company\u00a0accounted for 7.2%, 7.9% and 1.6% of\u00a0our revenue, respectively. In \n2021\n, our key customers in the CATV market included ATX, Cisco,\u00a0and CommScope. In \n2021, 2020 and 2019\n, ATX accounted for 25.6%, 3.7% and 0% of our revenue, Cisco accounted for 11.9%, 7.5%, and 10.0% of our revenue, and CommScope accounted for 3.3%, 2.1%, and 3.7% of our revenue,\u00a0respectively.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       30\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn \n2021\n, our revenue decrease of 9.8% over the prior-year\u00a0was driven primarily by decreased demand for the datacenter products; this slowdown was related to inventory normalization following the surge in demand that was driven by the shift to working from home in 2020. We believe datacenter demand will improve in 2022. The decreased demand for datacenter products was \ufeffoffset by\u00a0increased demand for CATV\u00a0products from several existing customers. The\u00a0increase in\u00a0demand from CATV\u00a0multiple-system operators (\"MSOs\") resulted in strong demand for our CATV products, especially those products that are related to architecture improvements to enable delivery of additional bandwidth to consumers.\u00a0 This increase in bandwidth demand is particularly acute in the upstream direction, and sales of products associated with\u00a0increased return-path bandwidth were notably strong in the fourth quarter. Based on forecasts and current order bookings, we believe that this CATV demand will likely continue through 2022.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe expect continued sales of our 40 Gbps and 100 Gbps products in 2022, and we expect that sales of 100 Gbps products will likely exceed sales of 40 Gbps products. However, quarter-to-quarter results may show considerable variability as is usual in a period of technology transition.\u00a0\u00a0Similar to revenue, our gross margins can fluctuate materially depending on a variety of factors including average selling price changes, product mix, global supply chain situation, raw material cost reduction or increase, manufacturing utilization rate and changes in manufacturing efficiency.\u00a0Furthermore, we are continuing to monitor and assess the effects of the coronavirus outbreak on our commercial and manufacturing operations, including any impact on our revenue in 2022.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOur sales model focuses on direct engagement and close coordination with our customers to determine product design, qualifications, performance and price. Our strategy is to use our direct sales force to sell to key accounts and to expand our use of distributors for increased coverage in certain international markets and certain domestic market segments. We have direct sales personnel that cover the U.S., Taiwan and China focusing primarily on major OEM customers and internet data center operators. Throughout our sales cycle, we work closely with our customers to qualify our products into their product lines. As a result, we strive to build strategic and long-lasting customer relationships and deliver products that are customized to our customers\u2019 requirements.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOur business depends on winning competitive bid selection processes to develop components, systems and equipment for use in our customers\u2019 products. These selection processes are typically lengthy, and as a result our sales cycles will vary based on the level of customization required, market served, whether the design win is with an existing or new customer and whether our solution being designed in our customers\u2019 product is our first generation or subsequent generation product. We do not have any long-term purchase commitments (in excess of one year) with any of our customers, most of whom purchase our products on a purchase order basis, however, once one of our solutions is incorporated into a customer\u2019s design, we believe that our solution is likely to continue to be purchased for that design throughout that product\u2019s life cycle because of the time and expense associated with redesigning the product or substituting an alternative solution.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIn \n2021, 2020 and 2019\n, we had 20, 30, and 31 design wins, respectively. We define a design win as the successful completion of the evaluation stage, where our customer has tested our product, verified that our product meets substantially all of their requirements and has informed us that they intend to purchase the product from us. Although we believe that our ability to obtain design wins is a key strength and can provide meaningful and recurring revenue, an increase or decrease in the mere number of design wins does not necessarily correlate to a likely increase or decrease in revenue, particularly in the short term. As such, the number of design wins we achieve on a quarterly or annual basis and any increase or decrease in design wins will not necessarily result in a corresponding increase or decrease in revenue in the same or immediately succeeding quarter or year. For example, if our total number of design wins in an annual or quarterly period increases or decreases compared to the total number of design wins in a prior period, this does not necessarily mean that our revenue in such period will be higher or lower than our revenue in the prior period. In fact, our experience is that some design wins result in significant revenue and some do not, and the timing of such revenue is difficult to predict as it depends on the success of the end customer\u2019s product that uses our components. Thus, some design wins result in orders and significant revenue shortly after the design win is awarded and other design wins do not result in significant orders and revenue for several months or longer after the initial design win (if at all). We do believe that over a period of years the collective impact of design wins correlates to our overall revenue growth.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict as COVID-19 continues to spread around the world. In March 2020, we instituted travel restrictions and implemented sanitation and disinfection procedures to safeguard the health and safety of our employees which continue today. Recently, we began allowing certain employee travel, but continue strict sanitation procedures in our facilities. With increased vaccinations and the potential reduction of infections, we implemented procedures for a safe return to the office environment for all of our employees. However, even with these precautions, it is not possible to eliminate the risk of a widespread outbreak among our employees and if such an outbreak were to occur, it would likely have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and our financial condition. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe spread of COVID-19 may still impact our supply chain operations through restrictions, reduced capacity and shutdown of business activities by suppliers whom we rely on for sourcing components and materials and third-party partners whom we rely on for manufacturing, warehousing and logistics services. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may materially impact our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations is uncertain.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       31\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIncreasing Consumer Demand for Bandwidth.\n Bandwidth demand in all of our target markets is driving service provider investment in new equipment and in turn generating demand for our products. Increasingly, optical networking technologies are being incorporated into networking equipment, replacing legacy copper-based networking technologies. This shift to optical networking solutions benefits us as a provider of those solutions.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nPricing, Product Cost and Margins.\n Our products are sold in a highly competitive marketplace, and in many cases our products are only minimally differentiated from those of our competitors.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, our sales are heavily concentrated with a small number of end customers.\u00a0\u00a0As a result, there is strong pricing pressure across many of our product lines.\u00a0\u00a0We have addressed this strong pressure in several ways:\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \nLowering our material costs.\u00a0\u00a0In some cases, we are able to negotiate more favorable pricing from our raw material suppliers.\u00a0\u00a0Also, where feasible, we are often able to develop internal production for certain materials that were previously purchased from other companies.\u00a0\u00a0This generally has resulted in lower material costs for us.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \nEnhancing the efficiency of our production process.\u00a0\u00a0We have been able to automate many of our production processes, which often results in lower labor costs and reduced scrap or rework rates, both of which lower our production cost.\u00a0\u00a0In some cases, we have been able to redesign our products to make them less complex to manufacture, and when possible during these redesigns we also incorporate lower cost raw materials.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u2011\n \n\n\n \nIntroducing new products.\u00a0\u00a0In many cases, newly released products have more features and often higher prices compared with older products.\u00a0\u00a0By regularly introducing new products, we attempt to minimize the average price reduction we experience.\u00a0\u00a0However, we often initially experience lower gross margins on new products, as our pricing is based upon anticipated volume-driven cost reductions over the life of the design win. Thus, if we are unable to realize our expected cost reductions, we may experience declining gross margins on such products.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOur product pricing is established when the product is initially introduced to the market, and thereafter through periodic negotiations with customers. We generally do not agree to periodic automatic price reductions. Furthermore, due to the dynamics in the CATV market and the value of our outsourced design services to our customers, we believe we face less downward price pressure than many of our competitors in this market. We sell a wide variety of products among our four target markets and our gross margin is heavily dependent in any quarter on the product mix achieved during that period as well as any price changes that we have agreed upon with our customers.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nCustomer Concentration within End Markets.\n\u00a0Historically, our revenue has been significantly concentrated within the data center market, and for \n2021\n\u00a0our revenue now tends to be split between data center market and CATV market. Moreover, within these markets, revenue tends to be concentrated among a small number of customers. In the last couple years, we have taken several actions to increase the diversity of our customer base. These actions include hiring additional sales staff to improve our ability to serve new customers and introduction of new products that we believe will appeal to new customers. Furthermore, we have developed additional original design manufacturer, or ODM, relationships with customers in each of our target markets which should enable us to diversify our revenue base. We had\u00a0three and two customers that accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in \n2021\n and \n2020\n, respectively.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nProduct Development.\n We invest heavily to develop new and innovative products. The majority of our research and development expense is allocated to product development, usually with a specific customer and customer platform in mind. We believe our close coordination with our customers regarding their future product requirements enhances the efficiency of our research and development expenditures.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       32\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDiscussion of Financial Performance\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nRevenue\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe generate revenue through the sale of our products to equipment providers for the internet data center, CATV, telecom, FTTH and other markets.

Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring products or providing services. A majority of our annual sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, but some sales from our Taiwan location and China-based subsidiary are denominated in NT dollars and RMB, respectively. For the year ended \nDecember 31, 2021\n, 46.2% of our total revenue was manufactured at our China-based subsidiary, with $16.6\u00a0million denominated in RMB and 46.9% of our total revenue was from products manufactured at our Taiwan-based facility with no revenue denominated in NT dollars. We expect a similar portion of our sales to be denominated in foreign currencies in 2022.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nCost of goods sold and gross margin\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOur cost of goods sold is impacted by variances arising from changes in yields and production volume, as well as increases or decreases in the cost of raw materials used in production. We typically experience lower yields and higher associated costs on new products. For our mature products, we can experience lower yields and higher production costs if customer requirements change or if we experience manufacturing difficulties or quality issues during our production process. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, in general for our mature products our cost of goods sold for a particular product declines over time as a result of increasing efficiencies in the manufacturing processes, or supply cost declines, as well as yield improvements and testing enhancements.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe manufacture products in three of our four facilities located in the U.S., Taiwan and China. Generally, laser chips and optical components are manufactured in our Sugar Land facility, optical components and subassemblies are manufactured in our Taiwan facility, and optical components, subassemblies\u00a0and optical equipment are manufactured in our China facility. Because of our vertical integration model, we generally utilize our own optical component products in our semi-finished and finished goods that we sell between and among our respective manufacturing operations. We base those internal sales upon established transfer pricing methodologies. However, we eliminate all of those internal sales, and cost of goods sold transactions, to arrive at total revenue and cost of goods sold on a consolidated basis.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       33\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have a global set of suppliers to help balance considerations related to product availability, quality and cost. Components of our cost of goods sold are denominated in U.S. or NT dollars or RMB, depending upon the manufacturing location.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nGross profit as a percentage of total revenue, or gross margin, has been and is expected to continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the introduction of new products, production volumes, the mix of products sold, the geographic region in which products are sold, changes in the cost and volumes of materials purchased from our suppliers, changes in labor costs, changes in overhead costs, reserves for excess and obsolete inventories and changes in the average selling prices of our products. Although our overall gross margins over the past three years have been between 17.8% and 24.2%, our gross margins vary more broadly on a product-by-product basis. Our newer and more advanced products typically have higher average selling prices and higher gross margins; however, until the product volumes scale, the gross margin from newer and advanced products may initially be lower. Within our markets, we may sell similar products to different geographic regions at different prices, and therefore realize different gross margins among those similar products. Our strategy is to improve our gross margins through vertical integration such as utilization of our own laser chips and optical sub-components in our solutions. We expect that our gross margins are likely to continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter because of the variety of products we sell and the relative product mix within a quarter.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOperating expenses\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and include salaries, benefits, bonuses and share-based compensation. With regard to sales and marketing expense, personnel costs also include sales commissions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nResearch and development.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nResearch and development, or R&D, expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including share-based compensation for R&D personnel, and R&D work orders (that include material, direct labor and allocated overhead), as well as allocated development costs, such as engineering services, software and hardware tools, depreciation of capital equipment and facility costs. We record all research and development expense as incurred. Customers rely upon us to assist them with the development of new products and modification of existing products because of our extensive optical design and manufacturing expertise. We work closely with our customers in the critical design phase of product development and are occasionally reimbursed for some of these development efforts. We expect research and development expense to increase on a dollar basis, but will likely decrease as a percentage of our revenue to the extent that revenue increases over time.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSales and marketing.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including share-based compensation for our sales and marketing personnel, as well as travel and trade show expense, shipping and tariff expense, sales commissions and the allocation of overall corporate services and facility costs. We sell our products to customers who either incorporate our products into their offering or resell our products to end customers. Because we sell to a limited number of well-established customers, we employ a limited number of sales professionals who are able to cover large markets. We compensate our sales staff through base salary and commissions, with base salary being the largest component of overall compensation. Total sales commissions to employees amounted to less than one percent of our revenue in \n2021, 2020 and 2019\n. Additionally, we pay commissions to third parties on certain product lines and identified customers, which also amounted to less than one percent of our revenue in \n2021, 2020 and 2019\n. As such, our sales and marketing expense does not directly increase with revenue. In the future, we expect sales and marketing expense to increase on a dollar basis as we incrementally increase our overall sales activities, but expect our sales and marketing expense to decline as a percentage of revenue, to the extent our revenue increases over time.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGeneral and administrative.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including share-based compensation, primarily for our finance, human resources, legal and information technology personnel and certain executive officers, as well as professional services costs related to accounting, tax, banking, legal and information technology services, depreciation of capital equipment and facility costs. We expect general and administrative expense to increase as we continue to grow in both size and complexity as a public company. We expect rising costs including increased audit and legal fees, costs to comply with rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a national stock exchange, as well as investor relations expense and higher insurance premiums. In the future, we expect general and administrative expense to increase on a dollar basis but to decline as a percentage of revenue, to the extent that our revenue increases over time.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       34\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOther income (expense)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nInterest income consists of income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Interest expense consists of amounts paid for interest on our short-term and long-term debt borrowings, and convertible senior notes.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOther income (expense), net is primarily made up of government subsidized income, extinguishment of debt\u00a0and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. The functional currency of our China subsidiary is the RMB and the foreign currency transaction gains and losses of our China subsidiary primarily result from their transactions in U.S. dollars. The functional currency of our Taiwan location is the NT dollar and the foreign currency transaction gains and losses of our Taiwan location primarily result from their transactions in U.S. dollars.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIncome taxes \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe are a U.S. registered company and are subject to income taxes in the U.S. We also operate in a number of countries throughout the world, including Taiwan and China. Consequently, our effective tax rate is impacted by the geographic distribution of our earnings or losses and the tax laws and regulations in each geographical region. We expect that our income taxes will vary in relation to our profitability and the geographic distribution of our profits. In \n2021\n our effective tax rate was (0.0%). \nIn \n2020\n and \n2019\n, our effective tax rate was (14.1%) and (28.5%), respectively.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur wholly owned subsidiary, Global Technology, Inc., has received preferential tax concessions in China as a national high-tech enterprise. In March 2007, China\u2019s parliament enacted the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the EIT Law, under which, effective January\u00a01, 2008, China adopted a uniform income tax rate of 25% for all enterprises including foreign invested enterprises. Global was recognized as a national high-tech enterprise in 2008 and was entitled to a 15% tax rate for a three year period. Global renewed its national high-tech enterprise certificate in 2011, 2014, 2017 and 2020,\u00a0extending\u00a0its three year tax preferential status through December\u00a02023.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nFor the years ended \nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020\n, we had $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits related to U.S. tax benefits recognized for which we do not meet the more likely than not threshold.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nSee additional information regarding income taxes in Note O, included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nSeasonality\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe are uncertain whether the demand for our internet data center, CATV, telecom and FTTH products is seasonal, as our sales data does not indicate a significant trend with respect to these products. We began to manufacture a meaningful quantity of internet data center and CATV products in our Ningbo, China factory in 2017 and 2020, respectively. This factory experiences a lengthy shut-down associated with the Lunar New Year holiday which occurs in Q1 of each year. In addition to the factory shut-down, it is also common for employees in the factory to fail to return to work following resumption of operations. In the years \n2021\n,\u00a0\n2020\n, and \n2019\n, the percentage of employees in our China factory who resigned or were terminated during Q1, relative to the average number of employees during the quarter was 101%, 217%, and 122%, respectively.\u00a0\u00a0 We believe that the turnover in \n2020 \nwas higher than usual due to the COVID-19 pandemic which caused travel restrictions, additional health check requirements, and a lengthy shutdown of operations in Ningbo.\u00a0 As a result of employee turnover, we must hire and train replacement employees.

The decreased demand for datacenter products was \ufeffoffset by\u00a0increased demand for CATV\u00a0products from several existing customers. The\u00a0increase in\u00a0demand from CATV\u00a0multiple-system operators (\"MSOs\") resulted in strong demand for our CATV products, especially those products that are related to architecture improvements to enable delivery of additional bandwidth to consumers.\u00a0 This increase in bandwidth demand is particularly acute in the upstream direction, and sales of products associated with\u00a0increased return-path bandwidth were notably strong in the quarter. Based on forecasts and current order bookings, we believe that this CATV demand will likely continue through 2022.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the years ended \nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020\n, our top ten customers represented 84.7% and 84.3% of our revenue, respectively.\u00a0We believe that diversifying our customer base is critical for our future success, since reliance on a small number of key customers makes our ability to forecast future results dependent upon the accuracy of the forecasts we receive from those key customers.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       36\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCost of goods sold and gross margin\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nYears ended December 31,\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n2021\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n2020\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nChange\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n% of\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n% of\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nAmount\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nRevenue\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nAmount\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nRevenue\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nAmount\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n(in thousands, except percentages)\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCost of goods sold\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n173,850\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n82.17\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n184,082\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n78.46\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n(10,232\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(5.6\n\n\n \n)%\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nGross margin\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n37,715\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n17.83\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n50,541\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n21.54\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCost of goods sold decreased by $10.2 million, or 5.6%, from\u00a0\n2020\n\u00a0to \n2021\n, primarily due to a 9.8% decrease in sales over the prior year.

In addition, we experienced\u00a0higher costs of certain raw materials and global supply chain disruptions due to COVID-19 closures of ports and factories in Asia (see the section above on the COVID-19 pandemic for more details of these challenges).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOperating expenses\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nYears ended December 31,\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n2021\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n2020\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nChange\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n% of\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n% of\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nAmount\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nrevenue\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nAmount\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nrevenue\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nAmount\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n(in thousands, except percentages)\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nResearch and development\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n41,220\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n19.5\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n43,393\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n18.5\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n(2,173\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(5.0\n\n\n \n)%\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSales and marketing\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n10,899\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5.2\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n14,087\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n6.0\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(3,188\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(22.6\n\n\n \n)%\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nGeneral and administrative\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n42,362\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n20.0\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n41,903\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n17.9\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n459\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTotal operating expenses\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n94,481\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n44.7\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n99,383\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n42.4\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n(4,902\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(4.9\n\n\n \n)%\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nResearch and development expense\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nResearch and development expense decreased \n$2.2 million, or 5.0%\n from\u00a0\n2020\n\u00a0and\u00a0\n2021\n.

The increase in 100 Gbps demand includes increased demand from several existing customers, along with new customer additions.\u00a0 We believe that some of this increase is related to increased demand for cloud-based services as a result of a shift to remote-working arrangements in the US and other areas, which in turn caused our customers to increase capacity in their data centers requiring more optical transceivers, especially\u00a0100 Gbps transceivers. The increase in 5G-related sales came mainly from customers in China, as wireless operators in that country have begun to deploy advanced 5G mobile networks.\u00a0The slight increase in revenue for our CATV products is due to increased demand from CATV MSOs as they began to add capacity to their networks.\u00a0 This increase in demand was at least partially attributable to network capacity expansion, particularly in the upstream direction, which is related to changes in network traffic due to increased working from home in the US earlier in the year.\u00a0 Towards the end of 2020, we saw a slow-down in orders from certain customers in our datacenter and telecom markets.\u00a0 We attribute the slowdown in datacenter business to absorption of previously-purchased inventory and in our telecom business to slow-down in the rate of deployment of new 5G mobile networks in China.\u00a0 We believe that both of these effects are temporary and we expect that they should be resolved in 2021.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our top ten customers represented 84.3%, and 88.1% of our revenue, respectively.\u00a0We believe that diversifying our customer base is critical for our future success, since reliance on a small number of key customers makes our ability to forecast future results dependent upon the accuracy of the forecasts we receive from those key customers.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCost of goods sold and gross margin\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nYears ended December 31,\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n2020\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n2019\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nChange\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n% of\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n% of\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nAmount\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nRevenue\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nAmount\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nRevenue\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nAmount\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n(in thousands, except percentages)\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCost of goods sold\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n184,082\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n78.46\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n144,671\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n75.8\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n39,411\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n27.2\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nGross margin\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n50,541\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n21.54\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n46,201\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n24.2\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCost of goods sold increased by $39.4\u00a0million, or 27.2%, from\u00a02019\u00a0to 2020, primarily due to a 22.9% increase in sales over the prior year. The decrease in gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period ended\u00a0December 31, 2019 was primarily the result of changes in the mix of products within our datacenter segment. In particular, we saw an increase in sales of certain lower-cost 100 Gbps transceivers, designed for shorter reaches within the datacenter, relative to sales of transceivers designed for longer reaches. This product mix resulted in an overall reduction in gross margin. Also contributing to the reduced gross margin was production inefficiencies, and higher costs of certain raw materials.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOperating expenses\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nYears ended December 31,\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n2020\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n2019\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nChange\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n% of\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n% of\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nAmount\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nrevenue\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nAmount\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nrevenue\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nAmount\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n(in thousands, except percentages)\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nResearch and development\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n43,393\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n18.5\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n43,399\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n22.7\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n(6\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(0.0\n\n\n \n)%\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSales and marketing\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n14,087\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n6.0\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n10,060\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5.3\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4,027\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n40.0\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nGeneral and administrative\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n41,903\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n17.9\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n41,489\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n21.7\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n414\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTotal operating expenses\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n99,383\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n42.4\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n94,948\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n49.7\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,435\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4.7\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       39\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nResearch and development expense\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nResearch and development expense was comparable between\u00a02019\u00a0and\u00a02020.

These increases were partially offset\u00a0by a\u00a0decrease in legal expenses, some of which were paid by our insurance carrier rather than the Company, as legal expenses related to the first of our shareholder class action lawsuits have exceeded the retention in our insurance contract.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOther income (expense), net\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nYears ended December 31,\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n2020\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n2019\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nChange\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n% of\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n% of\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nAmount\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nrevenue\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nAmount\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nrevenue\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nAmount\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n(in thousands, except percentages)\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nInterest income\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n255\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n925\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n(670\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(72.4\n\n\n \n)%\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nInterest expense\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(5,635\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(2.4\n\n\n \n)%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(5,405\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(2.8\n\n\n \n)%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(230\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4.3\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nOther income (expense), net\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2,998\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,840\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,158\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n62.9\n\n\n \n%\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTotal other income (expense), net\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n(2,382\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(1.0\n\n\n \n)%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n(2,640\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(1.4\n\n\n \n)%\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n258\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(9.8\n\n\n \n)%\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInterest income decreased by $0.6\ufeff million, or 72.4% from 2019\u00a0to 2020.

In the placement notice, the Company will designate the maximum number of Shares to be sold through the Sales Agent, the time period during which sales are requested to be made, the minimum price for the Shares to be sold, and any limitation on the number of Shares that may be sold in any one day. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, the Sales Agent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell Shares on the Company\u2019s behalf up to the designated amount specified in the placement notice.

Additionally, if the Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, and the Company fails to sell a minimum amount of the Shares as set forth in the Agreement, then the Company has agreed to reimburse the Sales Agent for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel incurred by the Sales Agent, up to a maximum of $30,000 in the aggregate.

These activities were offset by $0.9 million related to tax withholding associated with employee share-based compensation.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       42\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoans and commitments\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n     \u00a0\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have lending arrangements with several financial institutions. In the U.S., we have a revolving line of credit with Truist Bank. The\u00a0line\u00a0of credit contains financial covenants that may limit the amount and types of debt that we may incur.\u00a0As of \nDecember 31, 2021\n, we were in compliance with these covenants.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn Taiwan, we have an equipment finance agreement with Chailease Finance Co., Ltd. for Prime World\u2019s Taiwan Branch. In China, we have a revolving line of credit with China Merchants Bank Co., Ltd. and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Co., Ltd and a credit facility with China Zheshang Bank Co., Ltd. for our China subsidiary, Global.\n\n\n\n\n\n     \u00a0\n   \n\n\n\n\nAs of \n\n    December 31, 2021\n    \n, we had $7.4 million of unused borrowing capacity.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n     \u00a0\n   \n\n\n\n\nOn March 5, 2019, the Company issued\u00a0$80.5 million\u00a0of 5% convertible senior notes due 2024. The Notes will mature on March\u00a015, 2024, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSee Note K \u201cNotes Payable and Long-term Debt\u201d and Note L \u201cConvertible Senior Notes\u201d of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our notes payable and long-term debt and convertible senior notes.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nChina factory construction\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOn February 8, 2018, we entered into a construction contract with Zhejiang Xinyu Construction Group Co., Ltd. for the construction of a new factory and other facilities at our Ningbo, China location.\u00a0\u00a0Construction costs for these facilities under this contract are estimated to total approximately $27.5 million.\u00a0As of \nDecember 31, 2021\n, construction of the building is complete, and approximately \n$27.4 million of this total cost has been paid and\u00a0the remaining portion will be paid in yearly installments for three years after final inspection\n. We anticipate additional expenses for building improvements to the factory and we are in the process of evaluating the timing of these expenditures and obtaining bids for any such work.\u00a0\nBased \non forecasts, we believe the factory will be placed in service in the first half of 2022, property will be transferred from construction in progress to building and improvement at that time.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nFuture liquidity needs\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from our operating activities, and available credit will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support our research and development efforts, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products, changes in our manufacturing capacity and the continuing market acceptance of our products.\u00a0 In the event we need additional liquidity, we will explore additional sources of liquidity. These additional sources of liquidity could include one, or a combination, of the following: (i) issuing equity or debt securities, (ii) incurring indebtedness secured by our assets and (iii) selling product lines, other assets and/or portions of our business. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have outstanding notes payable with varying maturities. As of December 31, 2021, our notes payable had an aggregate amount of $54.7 million, with $49.7 million payable witin 12 months. Further information regarding our note payable is provided in Note K Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. We also have a fixed-rate convertible senior note. As of December 31, 2021, our convertible senior note had an aggregate principle amount of $80.5 million and future interest payments associated with our senior notes totaled $10.1 million. Further information regarding our convertible senior notes is provided in Note L \u2013 Convertible Senior Notes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. In addition, we have operating and financial lease for certain property and equipment with an expected term at the commencement date of more than 12 months. As of December 31, 2021, the future minimum payments required under these leases totaled $9.3 million, with $1.3 million payable within 12 months. Further information regarding our leases is provided in Note D \u2013 \nLeases \nto Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       43\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInflation\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe annual inflation rate in the US and Taiwan accelerated more than 7% in 2021. Cost inflation including increases in shipping costs, labor rates, and in costs of some raw materials; \nwe currently\ufeff believe these increases are related to the COVID-19 pandemic (please refer to our discussion on COVID-19 in the MD&A section of this Form 10-K), however we cannot be sure when or if prices will return to pre-pandemic levels. There is no guarantee that we can increase selling prices or reduce costs to fully mitigate the effect of inflation on our costs, which may adversely impact our sales margins and profitability. Compared to other major economies in the world, China has a stable level of inflation, which has not had a significant impact on our sales or operating results. \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S.\u00a0GAAP. These principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates include those related to revenue recognition, share-based compensation expense, impairment analysis of goodwill and long-lived assets, valuation of inventory, warranty liabilities and accounting for income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note\u00a0B to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe these are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       44\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLong-lived assets \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets for potential impairment when we determine a triggering event has occurred, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. When indicators exist, recoverability of assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying value of the asset group to the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Examples of such triggering events include a significant disposal of a portion of such assets, an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related asset, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from an acquired business, difficulties or delays in integrating the business, and a significant change in the operations of an acquired business. If such assets are determined not to be recoverable we perform an analysis of the fair value of the asset group and will recognize an impairment loss when the fair value is less than the carrying amount of such assets. The fair value, based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require subjective judgments. Depending on the assumptions and estimates used, the fair value projected in the evaluation of long-lived assets can vary within a range of outcomes. We consider the likelihood of possible outcomes in determining the best estimate for the fair value of the assets. We did not record any asset impairment charges in 2021, 2020, and 2019.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nValuation of inventories \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost (average-cost method) or market. Work in process and finished goods includes materials, labor and allocated overhead. We assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and provide an allowance for the value of estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on estimates of future demand. During the years ended \nDecember 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\n, we recorded excess and obsolete inventory reserve charges of $3.9 million, $3.9 million, and $6.8 million, respectively. For the years December \n2021, 2020 and 2019\n, the direct inventory write-offs related to scrap, discontinued products\u00a0and damaged inventories were $16.8 million, $20.4 million, and $13.4 million, respectively.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe have an accounting policy to write down the value of obsolete inventory. We considered the following factors in our determination of the appropriate reserve level: how often we buy material in bulk; the overall market value of raw material, semi-finished goods and finished goods across our varied product lines and within markets; changes in expected demand for our products; the change in valuations historically; the determined safety stock for key customers; and the likelihood of postponement in delivery schedules for materials already placed in finished goods inventory.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       45\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAccounting for income taxes\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of ASC\u00a0740, \nIncome Taxes\n. The liability method is used to account for deferred income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The ability to realize deferred tax assets is evaluated annually and a valuation allowance is provided if it is unlikely that the deferred tax assets will not give rise to future benefits in our tax returns.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe record uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn the basis of this evaluation, as of \nDecember 31, 2021\n, a valuation allowance of $57.7 million\u00a0has been recorded related to deferred tax assets to recognize only the portion of the deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or increased or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included on the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nSee additional information regarding income taxes in Note O of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nSee Note B of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       46\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ", "item7a": ">Item 7A. \n\n\n \nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nMarket Risks\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nMarket risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial statements through adverse changes in financial market prices and rates and inflation. Our market risk exposure results primarily from fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities. We have not historically attempted to reduce our market risks through hedging instruments; we may, however, do so in the future.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nInterest Rate Fluctuation Risk\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOur cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market funds, and interest and non-interest bearing bank deposits. Our primary objective is to maintain the security of our principal balances and ensure liquidity. We attempt to maximize the return on these balances without significantly increasing risk, but have little opportunity to do so given the short-term nature of our investments and current interest rate environments. We do not anticipate any material effect on our cash balances or investment portfolio due to fluctuations in interest rates.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe are exposed to market risk due to the possibility of changing interest rates associated with certain debt instruments. As of \nDecember 31, 2021\n, our debt bears a variable rate of interest that is based on SOFR or other interbank offered rates. The debt subject to variable rates is subject to fluctuation in the SOFR or other interbank offered rates. As of \nDecember 31, 2021\n, we had not hedged our interest rate risk.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWith respect to our interest expense for the three months ended \nDecember 31, 2021\n, an increase of 1.0% in each of our interest rates would have resulted in an increase of $0.5 million in our interest expense for such period.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nForeign Exchange Rates \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe operate on an international basis with a large portion of our business conducted in our Taiwan branch and China subsidiary. We use the U.S. dollar as our reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements. The financial records of our China subsidiary and our Taiwan branch are maintained in their respective local currencies, the RMB and the NT dollar, which are the functional currencies for our China subsidiary and our Taiwan branch, respectively. Assets and liabilities are translated at prevailing exchange rates at the balance sheet date, equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates and revenues, expenses, gains and losses are translated using the average rate for the then current period using a monthly average. Translation adjustments are reported as cumulative translation adjustments and are shown as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in our statement of stockholders\u2019 equity and comprehensive income.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAll transactions in currencies other than their functional currencies during the year are subject to foreign exchange risk when the exchange rate fluctuates on the respective relevant dates of such transactions. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in our statements of operations in other income (expense). Monetary assets and liabilities existing at the balance sheet date denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies are re-measured at the exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date and unrealized exchange differences are recorded in our consolidated income statement. In October 2015, we determined that certain intercompany loans are long-term investments. Therefore, exchange gain (loss) arising from re-measurement of intercompany loans were recorded in the Cumulative Translation Adjustment accounts.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nDuring the year ended \nDecember 31, 2021\n, we recognized less than $0.5 million of exchange gains arising from foreign currency transactions and re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities dominated in non-functional currency on the balance sheet date.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nDuring the year ended \nDecember 31, 2021\n, 7.9% of our revenue was denominated in RMB and none of our revenue was denominated in NT dollars. In the year ended \nDecember 31, 2021\n, 26.3% of our operating expenses were denominated in RMB and 21.9% of our operating expenses were denominated in NT dollars. Accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates directly affect our cost of goods sold and net income (loss), and have a significant impact on our operating margins. If exchange rates of RMB and NT dollars for U.S. dollars were 1% higher during the year ended \nDecember 31, 2021\n, our operating expenses would have had been higher by $0.5 million.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       47\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs of \nDecember 31, 2021\n, we held the U.S. dollar denominated liabilities net of assets\u00a0of approximately $5.7 million in our China subsidiary and $13.4 million in our Taiwan branch. With respect to these U.S. dollar denominated net assets\u00a0as of \nDecember 31, 2021\n, if exchange rates of RMB and NT dollars for U.S. dollars were 1% higher during the year ended \nDecember 31, 2021\n, our other operating expenses would have been reduced by $0.2 million. Any significant revaluation of the RMB and NT dollars may materially and adversely affect the cash flows, revenues, and net income (loss) as reported in U.S. dollars.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe currently do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate this exposure. We continue to review this issue and may consider hedging certain foreign exchange risks through the use of currency forwards or options in future years.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ", "companyName": "APPLIED OPTOELECTRONICS, INC.", "cusip": "038222105"}
