{"item1": ">ITEM\u00a01. BUSINESS \n\n\nOverview \n\n\nThe Invesco CurrencyShares\n\u00ae\n British Pound\u00a0Sterling Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d) is a grantor trust that was formed on June\u00a08, 2006. The Shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \u201cFXB\u201d on June\u00a026, 2006. The primary listing of the Shares was transferred to NYSE Arca, Inc. (\u201cNYSE Arca\u201d) on October\u00a030, 2007. The Trust issues shares (the \u201cShares\u201d) in blocks of 50,000 (a \u201cBasket\u201d) in exchange for deposits of British Pound\u00a0Sterling and distributes British Pound\u00a0Sterling in connection with the redemption of Baskets. \n\n\nThe investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the price in USD of the British Pound\u00a0Sterling plus accrued interest, if any, less the expenses of the Trust\u2019s operations. The Shares are intended to offer investors an opportunity to participate in the market for the British Pound\u00a0Sterling through an investment in securities. The Shares are intended to provide institutional and retail investors with a simple, cost-effective means of gaining investment benefits similar to those of holding the British Pound\u00a0Sterling. The Shares are bought and sold on NYSE Arca like any other exchange-listed security. The Shares are backed by the assets of the Trust, which does not hold or use derivative products. The Trust is a passive investment vehicle and does not have any officers, directors or employees. The Trust does not engage in any activities designed to obtain profit from, or ameliorate losses caused by, changes in the price of the British Pound\u00a0Sterling. Investing in the Shares does not insulate the investor from certain risks, including price volatility. The value of the holdings of the Trust is reported on the Trust\u2019s website, www.invesco.com/etfs, each business day. \n\n\nChange in Fiscal Year End\n\n\nOn January\u00a09, 2019, Invesco Specialized Products, LLC (the \u201cSponsor\u201d) changed the Trust\u2019s fiscal year from the period beginning on November\u00a01 and ending on October\u00a031 to the period beginning on January\u00a01 and ending on December 31. Unless otherwise noted, all references to \u201cyears\u201d in this report refer to the twelve-month fiscal year, which ends on December\u00a031 of each year. \n\n\nThe Trust \n\n\nGeneral \n\n\nThe Trust holds British Pound\u00a0Sterling and, from time to time, issues Baskets in exchange for deposits of British Pound\u00a0Sterling and distributes British Pound\u00a0Sterling in connection with redemptions of Baskets. The British Pound\u00a0Sterling held by the Trust will be sold only (1)\u00a0if needed to pay Trust expenses, (2)\u00a0in the event the Trust terminates and liquidates its assets or (3)\u00a0as otherwise required by law or regulation. \n\n\nThe Sponsor \n\n\nThe Sponsor of the Trust generally oversees the performance of the Trustee and the Trust\u2019s principal service providers. The Sponsor is Invesco Specialized Products, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. The Sponsor changed its name from Rydex Specialized Products LLC to Guggenheim Specialized Products, LLC on March\u00a030, 2012, and subsequently changed its name to Invesco Specialized Products, LLC as of April\u00a06, 2018. \n\n\nThe Trust\u2019s only ordinary recurring expense is the Sponsor\u2019s fee. The Sponsor is responsible for payment of the following administrative and marketing expenses of the Trust: the Trustee\u2019s monthly fee, typical maintenance and transaction fees of the Depository, NYSE Arca listing fees, printing and mailing costs, audit fees and expenses, up to $100,000 per year in legal fees and expenses, and applicable license fees. The Sponsor also paid the costs of the Trust\u2019s organization, including the applicable Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) registration fees. The Sponsor\u2019s fee accrues daily at an annual nominal rate of 0.40% of the British Pound\u00a0Sterling in the Trust (including all unpaid interest but excluding unpaid fees, each as accrued through the immediately preceding day). The Trust incurred $579,451 for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021 in Sponsor\u2019s fees. \n\n\nThe Trustee \n\n\nThe Bank of New York Mellon, a banking corporation with trust powers organized under the laws of the State of New York, serves as the Trustee. The Trustee is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Trust, including keeping the Trust\u2019s operational records. \n\n\nNet Asset Value \n\n\nThe Trustee calculates, and the Sponsor publishes, the Trust\u2019s Net Asset Value (\u201cNAV\u201d) each business day. To calculate the NAV, the Trustee adds to the amount of British Pounds Sterling in the Trust at the end of the preceding day accrued but unpaid interest, if any, British Pounds Sterling receivable under pending purchase orders and the value of other Trust assets, and subtracts the accrued but unpaid Sponsor\u2019s fee, British Pounds Sterling payable under pending redemption orders and other Trust expenses and liabilities, if any. The NAV is expressed in U.S. Dollars (\u201cUSD\u201d) based on the British Pound Sterling/USD exchange rate as \n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\ndetermined by The WM Company at 4:00 PM (London time / London fixing) (the \u201cClosing Spot Rate\u201d) on each day that NYSE Arca is open for regular trading. If, on a particular evaluation day, the Closing Spot Rate has not been determined and announced by 6:00 PM (London time), then the most recent Closing Spot Rate is used to determine the NAV of the Trust unless the Trustee, in consultation with the Sponsor, determines that such price is inappropriate to use as the basis for the valuation. \n\n\nThe Trustee also determines the NAV per Share, which equals the NAV of the Trust divided by the number of outstanding Shares. The NAV of the Trust and the NAV per Share are published by the Sponsor on each day that NYSE Arca is open for regular trading and are posted on the Trust\u2019s website, www.invesco.com/etfs. \n\n\nDepository and Deposit Accounts \n\n\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., London Branch, is the Depository. The Depository maintains two deposit accounts for the Trust, a primary deposit account that may earn interest and a secondary deposit account that does not earn interest (collectively, the \u201cDeposit Accounts\u201d). Interest on the primary deposit account, if any, accrues daily and is paid monthly. If the Sponsor believes that the interest rate paid by the Depository is not competitive, the Sponsor\u2019s recourse is to remove the Depository by terminating the Deposit Account Agreement and closing the Deposit Accounts. The Depository is not paid a fee for its services to the Trust. The Depository may earn a \u201cspread\u201d or \u201cmargin\u201d over the rate of interest it pays to the Trust on the British Pound\u00a0Sterling deposit balances. \n\n\nThe secondary deposit account is used to account for any interest that may be received and paid on creations and redemptions of Baskets. The secondary deposit account is also used to account for interest earned on the primary deposit account, if any, pay Trust expenses and distribute any excess interest to Shareholders on a monthly basis. In the event that the interest deposited exceeds the sum of the Sponsor\u2019s fee for the prior month plus other Trust expenses, if any, then the Trustee will direct that the excess be converted into USD at the prevailing market rate and the Trustee will distribute the USD as promptly as practicable to Shareholders on a pro-rata basis (in accordance with the number of Shares that they own). \n\n\nTrust Expenses \n\n\nIn certain cases the Trust may pay expenses in addition to the Sponsor\u2019s fee. These exceptions include expenses not assumed by the Sponsor, expenses resulting from a negative interest rate, taxes and governmental charges, expenses and costs of any extraordinary services performed by the Trustee or the Sponsor on behalf of the Trust or action taken by the Trustee or the Sponsor to protect the Trust or the interests of Shareholders, indemnification of the Sponsor under the Depositary Trust Agreement, and legal expenses in excess of $100,000 per year. \n\n\nTermination \n\n\nThe Trust will terminate upon the occurrence of any of the termination events listed in the Depositary Trust Agreement and will otherwise terminate on\n \nJune\u00a08, 2046. \n\n\nThe Shares \n\n\nGeneral \n\n\nEach Share represents a proportional interest, based on the total number of Shares outstanding, in the British Pound\u00a0Sterling owned by the Trust, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, less accrued but unpaid expenses (both asset-based and non-asset based) of the Trust. All Shares are of the same class with equal rights and privileges. Each Share is transferable, is fully paid and non-assessable and entitles the holder to vote on the limited matters upon which Shareholders may vote under the Depositary Trust Agreement. \n\n\nLimited Rights \n\n\nThe Shares are not a traditional investment. They are dissimilar from the shares of a corporation operating a business enterprise, with management and a board of directors. Trust Shareholders do not have rights normally associated with owning shares of a business corporation, including, for example, the right to bring \u201coppression\u201d or \u201cderivative\u201d actions. Shareholders have only those rights explicitly set forth in the Depositary Trust Agreement. The Shares do not entitle their holders to any conversion or pre-emptive rights or, except as described herein, any redemption or distribution rights. \n\n\nVoting and Approvals \n\n\nShareholders have no voting rights under the Depositary Trust Agreement, except in limited circumstances. If the holders of at least 25% of the Shares outstanding determine that the Trustee is in material breach of its obligations under the Depositary Trust Agreement, they may provide written notice to the Trustee (or require the Sponsor to do so) specifying the default and requiring the Trustee to cure such default. If the Trustee fails to cure such breach within 30 days after receipt of such notice, the Sponsor, acting on behalf of the Shareholders, may remove the Trustee. The holders of at least 66 2/3% of the Shares outstanding may vote to remove the Trustee. The Trustee must terminate the Trust at the request of the holders of at least 75% of the outstanding Shares. \n\n\nCreation and Redemption of Shares \n\n\nThe creation and redemption of Baskets requires the delivery to the Trust or the distribution by the Trust of the amount of British Pound\u00a0Sterling represented by the Baskets being created or redeemed. This amount is based on the combined NAV per Share \n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nof the number of Shares included in the Baskets being created or redeemed, determined on the day the order to create or redeem Baskets is accepted by the Trustee. \n\n\nOnly Authorized Participants may place orders to create and redeem Baskets. An Authorized Participant is a Depository Trust Company (\u201cDTC\u201d) participant that is a registered broker-dealer or other securities market participant, such as a bank or other financial institution that is not required to register as a broker-dealer to engage in securities transactions. \n\n\nBefore initiating a creation or redemption order, an Authorized Participant must have entered into a Participant Agreement with the Sponsor and the Trustee. The Participant Agreement provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of Baskets and for the delivery of British Pound\u00a0Sterling required for creations and redemptions. The Participant Agreements may be amended by the Trustee and the Sponsor. Authorized Participants pay a transaction fee of $500 to the Trustee for each order that they place to create or redeem one or more Baskets. In addition to the $500 transaction fee paid to the Trustee, Authorized Participants pay a variable fee to the Sponsor for creation orders and redemption orders of two or more Baskets to compensate the Sponsor for costs associated with the registration of Shares. The variable fee paid to the Sponsor by an Authorized Participant will not exceed $2,000 for each creation or redemption order, as set forth in the Participant Agreement. Authorized Participants who make deposits with the Trust in exchange for Baskets receive no fees, commissions or other form of compensation or inducement of any kind from either the Sponsor or the Trust. No Authorized Participant has any obligation or responsibility to the Sponsor or the Trust to effect any sale or resale of Shares. \n\n\nAvailability of SEC Reports and Other Information \n\n\nThe Sponsor, on behalf of the Trust, files quarterly and annual reports and other information with the SEC which are available on the SEC\u2019s Internet site at http://www.sec.gov. The reports and other information can be accessed through the Trust\u2019s website at www.invesco.com/etfs.\n\n", "item1a": ">ITEM\u00a01A. RISK FACTORS \n\n\nYou should consider carefully the risks described below before making an investment decision. You should also refer to the other information included in this report, including the Trust\u2019s financial statements and the related notes\n. \n\n\nECONOMIC CONDITIONS\n\n\nThe value of the Shares relates directly to the value of the British Pound\u00a0Sterling held by the Trust. Fluctuations in the price of the British Pound\u00a0Sterling could materially and adversely affect the value of the Shares. \n\n\nThe Shares are designed to reflect the price of the British Pound\u00a0Sterling, plus accumulated interest, if any, less the Trust\u2019s expenses. Several factors may affect the price of the British Pound\u00a0Sterling, including: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nSovereign debt levels and trade deficits; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nDomestic and foreign inflation rates and interest rates and investors\u2019 expectations concerning those rates; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nCurrency exchange rates; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nInvestment and trading activities of mutual funds, hedge funds and currency funds; and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nGlobal, regional or national political, economic or financial events and situations. \n\n\nIn addition, the British Pound\u00a0Sterling may not maintain its long-term value in terms of purchasing power in the future. When the price of the British Pound\u00a0Sterling declines, the Sponsor expects the price of a Share to decline as well. \n\n\nOn June 23, 2016, the citizens of the United Kingdom, a European Union member that had not adopted the euro as its currency, voted to leave the European Union. The United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union on January 31, 2020, and was in a transition period through December 31, 2020, during which time the United Kingdom negotiated and entered into new trade agreements with the European Union and certain trade partner nations; however, trade agreements with other trade partner nations, including the United States and others, have not yet been negotiated. The consequences for the economies of the European Union members of the United Kingdom exiting the European Union are unknown and unpredictable, as is the future direction of the value of the British Pound Sterling and the Shares. These uncertainties could increase volatility in the market prices of the British Pound Sterling and the Shares. Increased volatility could, in itself, decrease the value of the Shares\n. \n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe British Pound Sterling/USD exchange rate, like foreign exchange rates in general, can be volatile and difficult to predict. This volatility could materially and adversely affect the performance of the Shares. \n\n\nForeign exchange rates are influenced by the factors identified in the preceding risk factor and may also be influenced by: changing supply and demand for a particular currency; monetary policies of governments (including exchange control programs, restrictions on local exchanges or markets and limitations on foreign investment in a country or on investment by residents of a country in other countries); changes in balances of payments and trade; trade restrictions; and currency devaluations and revaluations. Also, governments from time to time intervene in the currency markets, directly and by regulation, in order to influence prices directly. These events and actions are unpredictable. The resulting volatility in the British Pound Sterling/USD exchange rate could materially and adversely affect the performance of the Shares. \n\n\nIf interest earned by the Trust does not exceed the Trust\u2019s expenses, the Trustee will withdraw British Pounds Sterling from the Trust to pay these excess expenses, which will reduce the amount of British Pounds Sterling represented by each Share on an ongoing basis and may result in adverse tax consequences for Shareholders. \n\n\nEach outstanding Share represents a fractional, undivided interest in the British Pounds Sterling held by the Trust. Recently, the amount of interest earned by the Trust has not exceeded the Trust\u2019s expenses; accordingly, the Trustee has been required to withdraw British Pounds Sterling from the Trust to pay these excess expenses. As long as the amount of interest earned does not exceed expenses, the amount of British Pounds Sterling represented by each Share will gradually decline over time. This is true even if additional Shares are issued in exchange for additional deposits of British Pounds Sterling into the Trust, as the amount of British Pounds Sterling required to create Shares will proportionately reflect the amount of British Pounds Sterling represented by the Shares outstanding at the time of creation. Assuming a constant British Pounds Sterling price, if expenses exceed interest earned, the trading price of the Shares will gradually decline relative to the price of the British Pounds Sterling as the amount of British Pounds Sterling represented by the Shares gradually declines. In this event, the Shares will only maintain their original price if the price of the British Pound\u00a0Sterling increases. There is no guarantee that interest earned by the Trust in the future will exceed the Trust\u2019s expenses. \n\n\nInvestors should be aware that a gradual decline in the amount of British Pounds Sterling represented by the Shares may occur regardless of whether the trading price of the Shares rises or falls in response to changes in the price of the British Pound\u00a0Sterling. The estimated ordinary operating expenses of the Trust, which accrue daily, are described in \u201cBusiness \u2013 The Trust \u2013 Trust Expenses.\u201d \n\n\nThe payment of expenses by the Trust will result in a taxable event to Shareholders.\u00a0To the extent Trust expenses exceed interest paid to the Trust, a gain or loss may be recognized by Shareholders depending on the tax basis of the tendered British Pounds Sterling.\n\n\nThe interest rate paid by the Depository, if any, may not be the best rate available. If the Sponsor determines that the interest rate is inadequate, then its sole recourse is to remove the Depository and terminate the Deposit Accounts. \n\n\nThe Depository is committed to endeavor to pay a competitive interest rate on the balance of British Pounds Sterling in the primary deposit account of the Trust, but there is no guarantee of the amount of interest that will be paid, if any, on this account. Interest on the primary deposit account, if any, accrues daily and is paid monthly. The Depository may change the rate at which interest accrues, including reducing the interest rate to zero or below zero, based upon the Depository\u2019s belief that Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) does not accurately reflect the market, other market conditions or the Depository\u2019s liquidity needs. The Depository notifies the Sponsor of the interest rate applied each business day after the close of such business day. The Sponsor discloses the current interest rate on the Trust\u2019s website. If the Sponsor believes that the interest rate paid by the Depository is not adequate, the Sponsor\u2019s sole recourse is to remove the Depository and terminate the Deposit Accounts. The Depository is not paid a fee for its services to the Trust; rather, it generates income or loss based on its ability to earn a \u201cspread\u201d or \u201cmargin\u201d over the interest it pays to the Trust by using the Trust\u2019s British Pounds Sterling to make loans or in other banking operations. For these reasons, you should not expect that the Trust will be paid the best available interest rate at any time or over time. \n\n\nIf the Trust incurs expenses in USD, the Trust would be required to sell British Pounds Sterling to pay these expenses. The sale of the Trust\u2019s British Pounds Sterling to pay expenses in USD at a time of low British Pound\u00a0Sterling prices could adversely affect the value of the Shares. \n\n\nThe Trustee will sell British Pounds Sterling held by the Trust to pay Trust expenses, if any, incurred in USD, irrespective of then-current British Pound\u00a0Sterling prices. The Trust is not actively managed and no attempt will be made to buy or sell British Pounds Sterling to protect against or to take advantage of fluctuations in the price of the British Pound\u00a0Sterling. Consequently, if the Trust incurs expenses in USD, the Trust\u2019s British Pounds Sterling may be sold at a time when the British Pound\u00a0Sterling price is low, resulting in a negative effect on the value of the Shares. \n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Shares may trade at a price which is at, above, or below the NAV per Share. \n\n\nThe NAV per Share fluctuates with changes in the market value of the Trust\u2019s assets. The market price of Shares can be expected to fluctuate in accordance with changes in the NAV per Share, but also in response to market supply and demand. As a result, the Shares might trade at prices at, above or below the NAV per Share. \n\n\nDisruptions in the ability to create and redeem Baskets may adversely impact the price of the Shares.\n\n\nIt is generally expected that the public trading price per Share will track the NAV per Share closely over time. The relationship between the public trading price per Share and the NAV per Share depends, to a considerable degree, on the ability of Authorized Participants or their clients or customers to purchase and redeem Baskets in the ordinary course. If the Trust were to issue all Shares that have been registered or if the Trust does not have an effective registration statement with the SEC with sufficient Shares available, each of which may happen from time to time, the Trust would not be able to create new Baskets until it registered additional Shares and those additional Shares became available for sale. In addition, the Trust may, in its discretion, suspend the creation of Baskets for any reason and at any time. If the process for creating or redeeming Shares is impaired for any reason, Authorized Participants and their clients or customers may not be able to purchase and redeem Baskets. The inability to purchase and redeem Baskets could result in the Shares trading at a premium or discount to the NAV of the Trust. Such a premium or discount could be significant, depending upon the nature or duration of the impairment.\n\n\nSubstantial sales of British Pounds Sterling by the official sector could adversely affect an investment in the Shares. \n\n\nThe official sector consists of central banks, other governmental agencies and multi-lateral institutions that buy, sell and hold British Pounds Sterling as part of their reserve assets. The official sector holds a significant amount of British Pounds Sterling that can be mobilized in the open market. In the event that future economic, political or social conditions or pressures require members of the official sector to sell their British Pounds Sterling simultaneously or in an uncoordinated manner, the demand for British Pounds Sterling might not be sufficient to accommodate the sudden increase in the supply of British Pounds Sterling to the market. Consequently, the price of the British Pound\u00a0Sterling could decline, which would adversely affect an investment in the Shares.\n\n\nREGULATORY MATTERS\n\n\nChanges to United States tariff and trade policies may increase the volatility of foreign exchange rates. This volatility could materially and adversely affect the performance of the Shares. \n\n\nThere have been ongoing discussions and commentary regarding potential significant changes to United States trade policies, treaties and tariffs. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may increase the volatility of foreign exchange rates, including the USD/British Pound\u00a0Sterling exchange rate. The resulting volatility could materially and adversely affect the performance of the Shares. \n\n\nThe Deposit Accounts are not entitled to payment at any office of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. located in the United States. \n\n\nThe federal laws of the United States prohibit banks located in the United States from paying interest on unrestricted demand deposit accounts. Therefore, payments out of the Deposit Accounts will be payable only at the London branch of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., located in England. The Trustee will not be entitled to demand payment of these accounts at any office of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is located in the United States. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. will not be required to repay the deposit if its London branch cannot repay the deposit due to an act of war, insurrection or civil strife or an action by a foreign government or instrumentality (whether \nde jure\n or \nde facto\n) in England. \n\n\nShareholders do not have the protections associated with ownership of a demand deposit account insured in the United States by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the protection provided for bank deposits under English law. \n\n\nNeither the Shares nor the Deposit Accounts and the British Pounds Sterling deposited in them are deposits insured against loss by the FDIC, any other federal agency of the United States or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme of England. \n\n\nShareholders do not have the protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. \n\n\nThe Investment Company Act is designed to protect investors by preventing: insiders from managing investment companies to their benefit and to the detriment of public investors; the issuance of securities having inequitable or discriminatory provisions; the management of investment companies by irresponsible persons; the use of unsound or misleading methods of computing earnings and asset value; changes in the character of investment companies without the consent of investors; and investment companies from engaging in excessive leveraging. To accomplish these ends, the Investment Company Act requires the safekeeping and proper \n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nvaluation of fund assets, restricts greatly transactions with affiliates, limits leveraging, and imposes governance requirements as a check on fund management. \n\n\nThe Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act and is not required to register under that act. Consequently, Shareholders do not have the regulatory protections afforded to investors in registered investment companies. \n\n\nShareholders do not have the rights enjoyed by investors in certain other financial instruments. \n\n\nAs interests in a grantor trust, the Shares have none of the statutory rights normally associated with the ownership of shares of a business corporation, including, for example, the right to bring \u201coppression\u201d or \u201cderivative\u201d actions. Apart from the rights afforded to them by federal and state securities laws, Shareholders have only those rights relative to the Trust, the Trust property and the Shares that are set forth in the Depositary Trust Agreement. In this connection, the Shareholders have limited voting and distribution rights. They do not have the right to elect directors. See \u201cBusiness \u2013 The Shares \u2013 Limited Rights\u201d for a description of the limited rights of the Shareholders. \n\n\nShareholders that are not Authorized Participants may only purchase or sell their Shares in secondary trading markets. \n\n\nOnly Authorized Participants may create or redeem Baskets through the Trust. All other investors that desire to purchase or sell Shares must do so through NYSE Arca or in other markets, if any, in which the Shares are traded.\n\n\nINSOLVENCY OR TERMINATION OF THE DEPOSITORY OR TRUST\n\n\nIf the Depository becomes insolvent, its assets may not be adequate to satisfy a claim by the Trust or any Authorized Participant. In addition, in the event of the insolvency of the Depository or the U.S. bank of which it is a branch, there may be a delay and costs incurred in recovering the British Pounds Sterling held in the Deposit Accounts. \n\n\nBritish Pounds Sterling deposited in the Deposit Accounts by an Authorized Participant are commingled with British Pounds Sterling deposited by other Authorized Participants and are held by the Depository in either the primary deposit account or the secondary deposit account of the Trust. British Pounds Sterling held in the Deposit Accounts are not segregated from the Depository\u2019s other assets. The Trust has no proprietary rights in or to any specific British Pounds Sterling held by the Depository and will be an unsecured creditor of the Depository with respect to the British Pounds Sterling held in the Deposit Accounts in the event of the insolvency of the Depository or the U.S. bank of which it is a branch. In the event the Depository or the U.S. bank of which it is a branch becomes insolvent, the Depository\u2019s assets may not be adequate to satisfy a claim by the Trust or any Authorized Participant for the amount of British Pounds Sterling deposited by the Trust or the Authorized Participant and, in such event, the Trust and any Authorized Participant will generally have no right in or to assets other than those of the Depository. \n\n\nIn the case of insolvency of the Depository or JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the U.S. bank of which the Depository is a branch, a liquidator may seek to freeze access to the British Pounds Sterling held in all accounts by the Depository, including the Deposit Accounts. The Trust and the Authorized Participants could incur expenses and delays in connection with asserting their claims. These problems would be exacerbated by the fact that the Deposit Accounts are not held in the U.S. but instead are held at the London branch of a U.S. national bank, where they are subject to English insolvency law. Further, under U.S. law, in the case of the insolvency of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the claims of creditors in respect of accounts (such as the Trust\u2019s Deposit Accounts) that are maintained with an overseas branch of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. will be subordinate to claims of creditors in respect of accounts maintained with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the U.S., greatly increasing the risk that the Trust and the Trust\u2019s beneficiaries would suffer a loss. \n\n\nThe License Agreement with The Bank of New York Mellon may be terminated by The Bank of New York Mellon in the event of a material breach. Termination of the License Agreement might lead to early termination and liquidation of the Trust. \n\n\nThe Bank of New York Mellon and the Sponsor have entered into a License Agreement granting the Sponsor a non-exclusive, personal and non-transferable license to certain patent applications made by The Bank of New York Mellon covering systems and methods for securitizing a commodity for the life of such patents and patent applications. The license grant is solely for the purpose of allowing the Sponsor to establish, operate and market a currency-based securities product based solely on the securitization, in whole or in part, of a single non-U.S. currency. The License Agreement provides that either party may provide notice of intent to terminate the License Agreement in the event the other party commits a material breach. If the License Agreement is terminated and one or more of The Bank of New York Mellon\u2019s patent applications issue as patents, then The Bank of New York Mellon may claim that the operation of the Trust violates its patent or patents and seek an injunction forcing the Trust to cease operation and the Shares to cease trading. In that case, the Trust might be forced to terminate and liquidate, which would adversely affect Shareholders.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nShareholders may incur significant fees upon the termination of the Trust. \n\n\nThe occurrence of any one of several events would either require the Trust to terminate or permit the Sponsor to terminate the Trust. For example, if the Depository were to resign or be removed, then the Sponsor would be required to terminate the Trust. Shareholders tendering their Shares within 90 days of the Trust\u2019s termination will receive the amount of British Pounds Sterling represented by their Shares. Shareholders may incur significant fees if they choose to convert the British Pounds Sterling they receive to USD. \n\n\nDEPOSITARY TRUST AGREEMENT\n\n\nThe Depository owes no fiduciary duties to the Trust or the Shareholders, is not required to act in their best interest and could resign or be removed by the Sponsor, which would trigger early termination of the Trust. \n\n\nThe Depository is not a trustee for the Trust or the Shareholders. As stated above, the Depository is not obligated to maximize the interest rate paid to the Trust. In addition, the Depository has no duty to continue to act as the depository of the Trust. The Depository can terminate its role as depository for any reason whatsoever upon 90 days\u2019 notice to the Trust. If directed by the Sponsor, the Trustee must terminate the Depository. Such a termination might result, for example, if the Sponsor determines that the interest rate paid by the Depository is inadequate. In the event that the Depository was to resign or be removed, the Trust will be terminated. \n\n\nRedemption orders are subject to rejection by the Trustee under certain circumstances. \n\n\nThe Trustee will reject a redemption order if the order is not in proper form as described in the Participant Agreement or if the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of its counsel, might be unlawful. Any such rejection could adversely affect a redeeming Shareholder. For example, the resulting delay would adversely affect the value of the Shareholder\u2019s redemption distribution if the NAV were to decline during the delay. In the Depositary Trust Agreement, the Sponsor and the Trustee disclaim any liability for any loss or damage that may result from any such rejection. \n\n\nThe liability of the Sponsor and the Trustee under the Depositary Trust Agreement is limited and, except as set forth in the Depositary Trust Agreement, they are not obligated to prosecute any action, suit or other proceeding in respect of any Trust property. \n\n\nThe Depositary Trust Agreement provides that neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee assumes any obligation or is subject to any liability under the Trust Agreement to any Shareholder, except that they each agree to perform their respective obligations specifically set forth in the Depositary Trust Agreement without negligence or bad faith. Additionally, neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee is obligated to, although each may in its respective discretion, prosecute any action, suit or other proceeding in respect of any Trust property. The Depositary Trust Agreement does not confer upon Shareholders the right to prosecute any such action, suit or other proceeding. \n\n\nThe Depositary Trust Agreement may be amended to the detriment of Shareholders without their consent. \n\n\nThe Sponsor and the Trustee may amend most provisions (other than those addressing core economic rights) of the Depositary Trust Agreement without the consent of any Shareholder. Such an amendment could impose or increase fees or charges borne by the Shareholders. Any amendment that increases fees or charges (other than taxes and other governmental charges, registration fees or other expenses), or that otherwise prejudices any substantial existing rights of Shareholders, will not become effective until 30 days after written notice is given to Shareholders. \n\n\nCOVID-19 PANDEMIC\n\n\nThe novel coronavirus known as COVID-19 is harming the global, regional and national economies in unexpected, unpredictable ways that could materially and adversely affect the value of the Shares.\n\n\nCOVID-19 spread globally throughout 2020 and 2021 and continues to spread in 2022. This pandemic has had material adverse effects on the global economy, including lower levels of economic activity and widespread unemployment. The economic turmoil has led to unprecedented amounts of stimulus in regional and national economies by central banks and other governmental authorities. Despite massive intervention, the humanitarian and economic crisis continues, and financial markets have generally experienced heightened volatility. No assurance can be given that the disruption will end soon or that the value of the Shares will not be affected materially and adversely by the pandemic and its consequences. Escalation or prolonged continuation of the pandemic could exacerbate other risk factors identified in this Report and materially and adversely affect the value of the Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOTHER RISKS\n\n\nDue to the increased use of technologies, intentional and unintentional cyber attacks pose operational and information security risks.\n\n\nWith the increased use of technologies such as the Internet and the dependence on computer systems to perform necessary business functions, the Trust is susceptible to operational and information security risks. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyber attacks include, but are not limited to gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. \n\n\nCyber attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites. Cyber security failures or breaches of the Trust's third party service providers (including, but not limited to, the Trustee and the Sponsor) have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in financial losses, the inability of Shareholders or Authorized Participants to transact business in Shares and Baskets respectively, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs. In addition, substantial costs may be incurred in order to prevent any cyber incidents in the future. The Trust and its Shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result. \n\n\nWhile the Sponsor has established business continuity plans and systems reasonably designed to detect and prevent such cyber attacks from being effective, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. For instance, it is possible that certain existing risks have not been identified or that new risks will emerge before countervailing measures can be implemented. Furthermore, the Trust cannot control, or even necessarily influence, the cyber security plans and systems put in place by the Trust's third party service providers. Since the Trust is dependent upon third party service providers (including the Sponsor and Trustee) for substantially all of its operational needs, the Trust is subject to the risk that a cyber attack on a service provider will materially impair its normal operations even if the Trust itself is not subject to such an attack. In addition, a service provider that has experienced a cyber security incident may divert resources normally devoted to servicing the Trust to addressing the incident, which would be likely to have an adverse effect on the Trust's operations.\n\n", "item7": ">ITEM\u00a07. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\n\nIntroduction\n \n\n\nThe following discussion and analysis was prepared to supplement information contained in the accompanying financial statements and is intended to explain certain items regarding the Trust's financial condition as of December 31, 2021, and its results of operations for the fiscal years ended December\u00a031, 2021 and December 31, 2020. It should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes thereto contained in this report.\n\n\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information \n\n\nThis report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cseek,\u201d \u201coutlook\u201d and \u201cestimate\u201d and other similar words. Forward-looking statements are based upon our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. Various factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements. These factors include fluctuations in the price of the British Pound\u00a0Sterling, as the value of the Shares relates directly to the value of the British Pounds Sterling held by the Trust and price fluctuations could materially adversely affect an investment in the Shares. Readers are urged to review the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section in this report for a description of other risks and uncertainties that may affect an investment in the Shares. \n\n\nNeither the Sponsor nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of forward-looking statements contained in this report. The forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this report, and will not be revised or updated to reflect actual results or changes in the Sponsor\u2019s expectations or predictions. \n\n\nMovements in the Price of the British Pound\u00a0Sterling \n\n\nThe investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the price in USD of the British Pound\u00a0Sterling plus accrued interest, if any, less the expenses of the Trust\u2019s operations. The Shares are intended to provide institutional and retail investors with a simple, cost-effective means of gaining investment benefits similar to those of holding British Pounds Sterling. Each outstanding Share represents a proportional interest in the British Pounds Sterling held by the Trust. The following chart provides recent trends on the price of the British Pound\u00a0Sterling. The chart illustrates movements in the price of the British Pound\u00a0Sterling in USD and is based on the Closing Spot Rate: \n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNAV per Share; Valuation of the British Pound\u00a0Sterling \n\n\nThe following chart illustrates the movement in the price of the Shares based on (1)\u00a0NAV per Share, (2)\u00a0the \u201cbid\u201d and \u201cask\u201d midpoint offered on NYSE Arca and (3)\u00a0the Closing Spot Rate, expressed as a multiple of 100 British Pounds Sterling: \n\n\n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\n\nThe Sponsor is not aware of any known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in, or are reasonably likely to result in, material changes to the Trust\u2019s liquidity and capital resources needs. The Trust\u2019s Depository, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., London Branch, maintains two deposit accounts for the Trust, a primary deposit account that may earn interest and a secondary deposit account that does not earn interest. Interest on the primary deposit account, if any, accrues daily and is paid monthly. The interest rate in effect as of December\u00a031, 2021 was an annual nominal rate of 0.00%. The following chart provides the daily rate paid by the Depository since December 31, 2016: \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn exchange for a fee, the Sponsor bears most of the expenses incurred by the Trust. As a result, the only ordinary expense of the Trust during the period covered by this report was the Sponsor\u2019s fee. Each month the Depository deposits into the secondary deposit account accrued but unpaid interest, if any, and the Trustee withdraws British Pounds Sterling from the secondary deposit account to pay the accrued Sponsor\u2019s fee for the previous month plus other Trust expenses, if any. When the interest deposited, if any, exceeds the sum of the Sponsor\u2019s fee for the prior month plus other Trust expenses, if any, the Trustee converts the excess into USD at the prevailing market rate and distributes the USD as promptly as practicable to Shareholders on a pro-rata basis (in accordance with the number of Shares that they own). The Trust did not pay any distributions during the quarter ended December\u00a031, 2021. \n\n\nResults of Operations \n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Trust\u2019s net comprehensive income (loss) was, in part, impacted by market volatility and uncertainty caused by the novel coronavirus known as COVID-19, which is considered to be an unusual or infrequent event. Although the full and direct impact of COVID-19 on the Trust\u2019s net comprehensive income (loss) during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 cannot be known, it is believed that COVID-19 has impacted the Closing Spot Rate, the interest rate paid by the Depository, and the global economy and markets generally, including the number of Shares created and redeemed by the Trust.\n\n\nThe British Pound Sterling (GBP/USD) ended 2021 with a slightly negative performance, as tightening restrictions to curb the spread of the COVID-19 Omicron variant in the United Kingdom threatened to derail the Bank of England\u2019s rate hike plans. In the first half of 2021, an improving domestic economic growth outlook and gradual reopenings, driven by the United Kingdom\u2019s speedy vaccine rollout and a general firming in the market\u2019s risk appetite (which tends to weigh on the U.S. Dollar given its perception as one of the world\u2019s safe haven currencies), helped the GBP/USD currency pair recover to nearly the highest level since 2018, before giving up all its gains to the COVID-19 Omicron variant in late 2021.\n\n\nThe British Pound Sterling (GBP/USD) ended 2020 with a positive performance, despite plunging to an over 35-year low right at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As lockdowns were put into place, spooked investors aggressively ditched the British Pound Sterling for the U.S. Dollar, which is generally perceived as one of the world\u2019s safe haven currencies, while concerns over the lack of progress in post-Brexit talks added further downward pressure. However, the GBP/USD currency pair gradually recovered through the year supported by a falling U.S. Dollar and improving risk sentiment. In addition, growing optimism around Brexit talks and Britain\u2019s then-new Brexit deal with the European Union at the end 2020, left the GBP/USD currency pair at the highest level since mid-2018.\n\n\nAdditionally, the interest rate paid by the Depository has generally trended downward over the past several years to the current interest rate of 0.00%, as set forth in the FXB Rate Chart above. As long as the Sponsor\u2019s fee and the interest expense on currency deposits, if any, exceed interest income, the Trust will incur a net comprehensive loss.\n\n\n Critical Accounting Estimates \n\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Sponsor\u2019s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period covered by this report. \n\n\nIn addition to the description below, please refer to Note 3 to the financial statements for further discussion of our accounting policies. \n\n\nThe functional currency of the Trust is the British Pound\u00a0Sterling in accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Translation. \n\n", "item7a": ">ITEM\u00a07A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \n\n\nExcept as described above with respect to\n \nfluctuations in the British Pound Sterling/USD exchange rate and changes in the nominal annual interest rate paid by the Depository on British Pound\u00a0Sterling held by the Trust, the Trust is not subject to market risk.\u00a0The Trust does not hold securities and does not invest in derivative instruments. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "companyName": "INVESCO CURRENCYSHARES BRIT", "cusip": "46090E103"}
