Coaching and mentoring all employees into becoming leaders will continue to drive CP forward.\nToday, we continue to apply our long-term strategy: leverage our lower cost base, network strengths and improved service to drive sustainable, profitable growth. While the accomplishments during the turnaround were tremendous, CP\u2019s journey to become North America\u2019s best-performing rail carrier is far from over. As a Company, we will remain focused on our next level of service, productivity, and innovation to continue to genera\nte sustainable\n value for our customers and results for our shareholders. \nBusiness Developments\nKCS transaction\nOn March 21, 2021, CP announced that it entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Original Merger Agreement\") with Kansas City Southern (\"KCS\"), under which CP agreed to acquire KCS in a stock and cash transaction. KCS is a U.S. Class I railway with approximately 7,100 route miles extending from the midwest and southeast portions of the United States south into Mexico and connects with all Class I railways, and primarily moves \n \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT\n \n \n4\nChemical and petroleum, Industrial and consumer products, Agriculture and minerals, Energy, Intermodal and Automotive. KCS is connected to the CP network at Kansas City.\nOn May 21, 2021, KCS terminated the Original Merger Agreement in order to enter into a merger agreement with Canadian National Railway (\"CN\") (the \"CN Merger Agreement\"). As a result, and under the terms of the Original Merger Agreement, KCS concurrently paid a merger termination fee of $845\u00a0million (U.S. $700\u00a0million) to the Company. \nOn August 10, 2021, CP submitted a proposal to acquire KCS in a stock and cash transaction representing an enterprise value of approximately U.S. $31\u00a0billion, based on the CP closing price on August 9, 2021, which included the assumption of U.S. $3.8\u00a0billion of outstanding KCS debt. The terms of the proposal were very similar in nearly every respect to those in the Original Merger Agreement, except for an increase in the share exchange ratio from 2.445 to 2.884. Following the United States Surface Transportation Board's (\"STB\") decision on August 31, 2021 to refuse CN and KCS's joint motion for voting trust approval in respect of the CN Merger Agreement, and after renewed negotiations with CP, KCS's Board of Directors deemed CP's proposal a \"Company Superior Proposal\", as defined in the CN Merger Agreement, and terminated the CN Merger Agreement.\nOn September 15, 2021, upon KCS's termination of the CN Merger Agreement, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger Agreement\") with KCS. Pursuant to the terms of the CN Merger Agreement, KCS paid a merger termination fee of U.S. $700\u00a0million and refunded the CP merger termination fee of U.S. $700\u00a0million to CN (together, the \"CN merger termination fees\"). In connection with the Merger Agreement, the Company remitted $1,773\u00a0million (U.S. $1,400\u00a0million) to KCS on September 15, 2021 in connection with KCS's payment of the CN merger termination fees.\nOn December 14, 2021, following approval of the transaction by the shareholders of both the Company and KCS, receipt of Mexican regulatory approvals, and satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions and pursuant to the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, the acquisition of KCS was consummated and all outstanding stock of KCS was deposited into a voting trust and held by a single trustee as trust stock. KCS's management and Board of Directors will continue to steward KCS while it is in trust, pursuing its independent business plan and growth strategies. The STB review of CP's proposed control of KCS while KCS is in the voting trust is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company issued 262.6\u00a0million Common Shares to existing KCS common stockholders at the exchange ratio of 2.884 Common Shares per share of KCS common stock and paid cash consideration to existing KCS stockholders of U.S. $90 per share of KCS common stock held and U.S. $37.50 per share of KCS preferred stock held for a total of approximately $10.5\u00a0billion (U.S. $8.2\u00a0billion). Share consideration, cash consideration, and the above described payments to KCS totaled approximately $36\u00a0billion (U.S. $28\u00a0billion). For additional information regarding this acquisition, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 11 Business acquisitions.\nUpon obtaining control approval from the STB and other remaining approvals of regulatory authorities, the two companies will be combined. Mr. Creel will serve as the Chief Executive Officer of the combined company. The combined entity will be named Canadian Pacific Kansas City (\"CPKC\"). Calgary, Alberta will be the global headquarters of CPKC, and Kansas City, Missouri will be designated as the U.S. headquarters. The Mexico headquarters will remain in Mexico City and Monterrey. CP's current U.S. headquarters in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota will remain an important base of operations. Four KCS Directors may join CP's expanded Board at the appropriate time, bringing their experience and expertise in overseeing KCS's multinational operations. \nThe transaction will combine the two railroads to create the first rail network connecting the U.S., Mexico, and Canada and will deliver dramatically expanded market reach for customers served by CP and KCS, provide new competitive transportation service options, and support North American economic growth.\nSpecific risk factors related to the KCS acquisition and pending KCS business combination are included in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nCOVID-19 pandemic\nIn 2021, CP\u2019s Pandemic Team continued to proactively monitor guidance and orders from governments, public health authorities, and regulatory agencies. Utilizing that guidance while implementing CP protocols and safety measures, the Company safely reintegrated its employees into the workplace where permissible. The Company maintained preventative measures that serve to minimize the risk of exposure to COVID-19, including physical distancing measures, restricting employee business travel, strengthening clean workplace and face covering practices, reinforcing socially responsible sick leave recommendations, limiting visitor and third-party access to Company facilities, and continuously re-evaluating our efforts with safety as a top priority. \nAdditional information concerning the impact COVID-19 may have to our future business and results of operations is provided in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nChange in Executive Officers\nIn August 2021, Mr. Michael Redeker retired from his position as Vice-President and Chief Information Officer. Effective July 19, 2021, CP's new Vice-President and Chief Information Officer is Ms. Pam Arpin.\n5 \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT  \n \nOther current business developments\nOn January 19, 2022, CP announced that, for the first time, it has been included on the Corporate Knights Global 100 Index, an annual ranking of the most sustainable corporations in the world. CP ranked 34th overall on the 2022 index and was the top performing freight transportation company evaluated globally. The Corporate Knights global ranking evaluated 6,914 companies with more than U.S. $1 billion in revenues worldwide on 23 quantitative key performance indicators, weighted to reflect each industry's impact to the overall economy. Performance indicators covered topics including percentage of \"clean\" revenue and \"clean\" investment, resource management, emissions, health and safety, diversity and workforce management.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, CP was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index (\"DJSI North America\") for 2021. This marked the second consecutive year CP has been listed on the DJSI North America. According to S&P, the DJSI North America comprises North American sustainability leaders as identified through the Corporate Sustainability Assessment. The index represents the top 20% of the largest 600 North American companies in the S&P Global Broad Market Index and measures corporate sustainability leaders' performance based on long-term economic, environmental and social criteria. \nOn July 26, 2021, CP published its first comprehensive Climate Strategy, outlining the Company's approach to drive innovative climate action and a measured response to emerging climate-related risks impacting the rail sector. The Climate Strategy outlines CP's objectives across strategic pillars, which include establishing a clear understanding of climate-related risks and opportunities; reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and adapting CP operations to the physical risks of climate change. To guide implementation of the Climate Strategy, CP has established two science-based emissions reduction targets that address 100% of CP's Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, and more than half of Scope 3 emissions:\n\u2022\nCP seeks to reduce Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions intensity of its locomotives by in excess of 38% by 2030 from a 2019 base year. Locomotive operations represent CP's largest source of emissions.\n\u2022\nTo support decarbonization across all operations, CP also seeks to reduce absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions from non-locomotive operations by in excess of 27% by 2030 from a 2019 base year.\nPlease see \n\u201cClimate-Related Risks\u2014The Company has established greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets to guide the implementation of CP's Climate Strategy. CP's inability to achieve GHG emissions reduction targets could negatively impact both our reputation and financial results\u201d \nin Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion \nThroughout 2021, CP made substantial progress implementing its Hydrogen Locomotive Program. First announced in late 2020, CP intends to develop North America\u2019s first hydrogen-powered line-haul freight locomotive by retrofitting a diesel-powered locomotive with a combination of hydrogen fuel cells and battery technology to drive the locomotive's electric traction motors. This initiative builds on the Company's prior experience with testing low-emitting locomotive technologies and aligns with CP's Climate Strategy in seeking to develop a new generation of locomotives with the potential to produce zero GHG emissions. In the first quarter of 2021, CP announced that the Hydrogen Locomotive Program would employ Ballard's hydrogen fuel cell modules. In the fourth quarter of 2021, CP announced it will expand the scope of its Hydrogen Locomotive Program with a $15 million grant from Emissions Reduction Alberta. The grant enables CP to increase the number of hydrogen locomotive conversions in the project from one to three and add hydrogen production and fueling facilities. CP conducted a successful movement test on the first hydrogen locomotive in December 2021. As locomotives become fully operational, CP will conduct rail service trials and qualification testing to evaluate the technology's readiness for the freight-rail sector. We believe this program will create critical industry knowledge and support the growth of a global centre of excellence in hydrogen and freight rail systems in Alberta, Canada.\nOn April 21, 2021, the five-for-one Share Split of the issued and outstanding Common Shares was approved at the Annual and Special Meeting of Shareholders. On May 13, 2021, the Company\u2019s shareholders of record as of May 5, 2021 received four additional Common Shares for every Common Share held. Ex-distribution trading in the Company\u2019s Common Shares on a split-adjusted basis commenced on May 14, 2021. Proportional adjustments were also made to outstanding awards under the Company's stock-based compensation plans in order to reflect the share split. All outstanding Common Shares, stock-based compensation awards, and per share amounts herein have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the share split.\nOn April 21, 2021, at the Company's Annual and Special Meeting of Shareholders, conducted virtually, all 11 director nominees were elected.\nIn the first quarter of 2021, CP completed the installation of the solar energy farm at its Calgary headquarters. This sustainability-driven project is one of the largest private solar farms in Alberta and is expected to generate more power than consumed annually by the main headquarters building.\nIn the first quarter of 2021, CP and the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority closed their transaction regarding western access at O\u2019Hare Airport and at Bensenville Yard, CP\u2019s principal rail facility in Chicago, Illinois. The transaction allows for the construction of a new tollway to the west side of O\u2019Hare Airport while protecting CP\u2019s ability to serve its customers moving freight through the critical Chicago gateway.\nOn March 21, 2021, CP's Board of Directors and President and CEO Keith Creel agreed on certain contract amendments to Mr. Creel's incentive compensation that are intended to see him lead the Company until at least early 2026.\n \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT\n \n \n6\nPrior Developments\nOn December 22, 2020, CP acquired full ownership of the Detroit River Tunnel Partnership (\"DRTP\"), which owns a 1.6-mile rail tunnel linking Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit, Michigan. The purchase price for the transaction was approximately $398 million, net of cash acquired. CP previously owned a 16.5% interest in the partnership and was its designated operator. For additional information regarding this acquisition, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 11 Business acquisitions.\nIn the second quarter of 2020, CP completed its previously announced acquisition of Central Maine & Quebec Railway U.S. Inc. (\"CMQ U.S.\"). Together with the December 30, 2019 completion of the acquisition of Central Maine & Qu\u00e9bec Railway Canada Inc. (\"CMQ Canada\"), the acquisition of CMQ U.S. completed CP's purchase of the entire Central Maine & Qu\u00e9bec Railway (\"CMQ\") network originally announced on November 20, 2019, for approximately $174 million (U.S. $133 million). For additional information regarding this acquisition, refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 11 Business acquisitions.\n7 \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT  \n \nOperations\nThe Company operates in only one operating segment: rail transportation. Although the Company provides a breakdown of revenue by business line, the overall financial and operational performance of the Company is analyzed as one segment due to the integrated nature of the rail network. Additional information regarding the Company's business and operations, including revenue and financial information, and information by geographic location is presented in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 29 Segmented and geographic information.\nLines of Business\nThe Company transports freight, consisting of bulk commodities, merchandise, and intermodal traffic. Bulk commodities, which typically move in large volumes across long distances, include Grain, Coal, Potash, and Fertilizers and sulphur. Merchandise freight consists of industrial and consumer products, such as Energy, chemicals and plastics, Metals, minerals and consumer products, Automotive, and Forest products. Intermodal traffic consists largely of retail goods in overseas containers that can be transported by train, ship and truck, and in domestic containers that can be moved by train and truck.\nThe Company\u2019s revenues are primarily derived from transporting freight. The following chart shows the Company's Freight revenue by each line of business in 2021, 2020 and 2019:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2021 Freight Revenues\n2020 Freight Revenues\n2019 Freight Revenues\n \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT\n \n \n8\nIn 2021, the Company generated Freight revenues totalling $7,816 million ($7,541 million in 2020 and $7,613 million in 2019).

This business is centred in the Canadian Prairies (Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Manitoba), with grain shipped primarily west to the Port of Vancouver and east to the Port of Thunder Bay for export. Grain is also shipped to the U.S., eastern Canada, and Mexico for domestic consumption.\nCanadian grain includes a division of business that is regulated by the Canadian government through the \nCanada Transportation Act\n (\u201cCTA\u201d). This regulated business is subject to a maximum revenue entitlement (\u201cMRE\u201d). Under the CTA, railways can set their own rates for individual movements. However, the MRE governs aggregate revenue earned by the railway based on a formula that factors in the total volumes, length of haul, average revenue per ton, and inflationary adjustments. The regulation applies to western Canadian export grain shipments to the ports of Vancouver and Thunder Bay.\nU.S. grain transported by CP consists of both whole grains, such as wheat, corn, soybeans, and durum, and processed products such as feed, meals, oils, and flour. This business is centred in the states of Minnesota, North Dakota, and Iowa. Grain destined for domestic consumption is interchanged with other carriers to the U.S. Midwest, the U.S Northeast via Chicago, and the U.S. Pacific Northwest. CP also delivers direct shipments of U.S. grain to western Canada primarily for animal feed. In partnership with other railways, CP moves U.S. grain to export terminals in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and the Gulf of Mexico. Export U.S. grain traffic is also shipped to the Port of Vancouver and the ports at Superior, Wisconsin and Duluth, Minnesota. \n \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT\n \n \n10\nCoal\nThe Company\u2019s Coal business represented approximately 20% of Bulk revenues, and was 8% of total Freight revenues in 2021.\nThe following charts compare the percentage of the Company's Coal freight revenues generated from Canadian and U.S. shipments in 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n2021 Coal Revenues\n2020 Coal Revenues\n2019 Coal Revenues\n(20% of Bulk Revenues; 8% of Freight Revenues)\n(18% of Bulk Revenues; 8% of Freight Revenues)\n(22% of Bulk Revenues; 9% of Freight Revenues)\nIn Canada, CP handles mostly metallurgical coal destined for export for use in the steelmaking process.

Cement is the leading commodity within aggregates, and is shipped directly from production facilities in Alberta, the U.S. Midwest, Ontario, and Qu\u00e9bec to energy and construction projects in western Canada, the U.S. Midwest, and the U.S. Pacific Northwest.\nThe majority of frac sand originates at mines located along the Company\u2019s network in Wisconsin and moves to the Bakken, Marcellus Shale, Permian Basin, and other shale formations across North America.\nCP transports steel in various forms from mills in the U.S. Midwest, the Canadian Prairies, and Ontario to a variety of industrial users. The Company carries base metals such as aluminum, zinc, and lead. CP also moves ores from mines to smelters and refineries for processing, and the processed metal to automobile and consumer products manufacturers.\n \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT\n \n \n14\nFood, consumer, and other products traffic consists of a diverse mix of goods, including food products, railway equipment, building materials, and waste products.\nAutomotive\nThe Company\u2019s Automotive business represented approximately 12% of Merchandise revenues, and was 5% of total Freight revenues in 2021.\nThe following charts compare the percentage of the Company's Automotive freight revenues generated by movements of finished vehicles from Canadian, U.S., overseas, and Mexican origins, parts and other, and machinery in 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n2021 Automotive Revenues\n2020 Automotive Revenues\n2019 Automotive Revenues\n(12% of Merchandise Revenues; \n5% of Freight Revenues)\n(12% of Merchandise Revenues; \n4% of Freight Revenues)\n(12% of Merchandise Revenues; \n5% of Freight Revenues)\nCP\u2019s Automotive portfolio consists of four finished vehicle traffic components: Canadian-produced vehicles that ship to the U.S. from Ontario production facilities; U.S.-produced vehicles that ship within the U.S. as well as cross border shipments to Canadian markets; vehicles from overseas that move through the Port of Vancouver to eastern Canadian markets; and Mexican-produced vehicles that ship to the U.S. and Canada. In addition to finished vehicles, CP ships pre-owned vehicles, machinery, and automotive parts. A comprehensive network of automotive compounds is utilized to facilitate final delivery of vehicles to dealers throughout Canada and in the U.S.\nINTERMODAL\nThe Company\u2019s Intermodal business represented approximately 22% of total Freight revenues in 2021.\nThe following charts compare the percentage of the Company's Intermodal freight revenues generated from Canada, ports, cross border transportation, other international, and U.S. in 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n2021 Intermodal Revenues\n2020 Intermodal Revenues\n2019 Intermodal Revenues\n(22% of Freight Revenues)\n(21% of Freight Revenues)\n(21% of Freight Revenues)\n15 \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT  \n \nDomestic intermodal freight consists primarily of manufactured consumer products that are predominantly moved in 53-foot containers within North America. International intermodal freight moves in marine containers to and from ports and North American inland markets.\nCP\u2019s domestic intermodal business moves goods from a broad spectrum of industries including wholesale, retail, food, and various other commodities.\u00a0Key service factors in domestic intermodal include consistent on-time delivery, the ability to provide door-to-door service, and the availability of value-added services. The majority of the Company\u2019s domestic intermodal business originates in Canada, where CP markets its services directly to retailers and manufacturers, providing\n \ncomplete door-to-door service and maintaining direct relationships with its customers.\u00a0In the U.S., the Company\u2019s service is delivered mainly through intermodal marketing companies.\nCP\u2019s international intermodal business consists primarily of containerized traffic moving between the ports of Vancouver, Montr\u00e9al, Saint John, and inland points across Canada and the U.S. Import traffic from the Port of Vancouver is mainly long-haul business destined for eastern Canada and the U.S. Midwest. CP works closely with the Port of Montr\u00e9al, a major year-round East Coast gateway to Europe, to serve markets primarily in Canada and the U.S. Midwest. CP's access to the Port of Saint John provides the fastest rail service from the east coast to the Canadian and U.S. Midwest markets for import and export cargo from Europe, South America, and Asia.\nFuel Cost Adjustment Program\nThe short-term volatility in fuel prices may adversely or positively impact revenues. CP employs a fuel cost adjustment program designed to respond to fluctuations in fuel prices and help reduce volatility to changing fuel prices. Fuel surcharge revenues are earned on individual shipments and are based primarily on the price of On-Highway Diesel. As such, fuel surcharge revenues are a function of freight volumes and fuel prices. Fuel surcharge revenues accounted for approximately 7% of the Company's Freight revenues in 2021. The Company is also subject to carbon taxation systems and levies in some jurisdictions in which it operates, the costs of which are passed on to the shipper.\u00a0As such, fuel surcharge revenue includes carbon taxes and levy recoveries.\nFreight revenues included fuel surcharge revenues of $535\u00a0million in 2021, an increase of $238\u00a0million, or 80%, from $297\u00a0million in the same period of 2020. This increase was primarily due to higher fuel prices and increased carbon tax recoveries. This increase was partially offset by the timing of recoveries from CP's fuel cost adjustment program.\nNon-freight Revenues\nNon-freight revenues accounted for approximately 2% of the Company\u2019s Total revenues in 2021. Non-freight revenues are generated from leasing certain assets; other arrangements, including contracts with passenger service operators and logistical services; and switching fees.\nSignificant Customers\nFor each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the company's revenues and operations were not dependent on any major customers. \nCompetition\nThe Company is in the ground transportation and logistics business. The Company sees competition in this segment from other railways, motor carriers, ship and barge operators, and pipelines. Depending on the specific market, competing railways, motor carriers, and other competitors may exert pressure on price and service levels. The Company continually evaluates the market needs and the competition. The Company responds as it deems appropriate to provide competitive services to the market. This includes developing new offerings such as transload facilities, new train services, and other logistics services.\nSeasonality\nVolumes and revenues from certain goods are stronger during different periods of the year. First-quarter revenues are typically lower mainly due to winter weather conditions, closure of the Port of Thunder Bay, and reduced transportation of retail goods. Second and third quarter revenues generally improve compared to the first quarter, as fertilizer volumes are typically highest during the second quarter and demand for construction-related goods is generally highest in the third quarter. Revenues are typically strongest in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of the transportation of grain after the harvest, fall fertilizer programs, and increased demand for retail goods moved by rail. Operating income is also affected by seasonal fluctuations. Operating income is typically lowest in the first quarter, due to lower freight revenue and higher operating costs associated with winter conditions.\n \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT\n \n \n16\nGovernment Regulation\nThe Company\u2019s railway operations are subject to extensive federal laws, regulations, and rules in both Canada and the U.S., which directly affect how operations and business activities are managed.\nEconomic Regulation - Canada\nThe Company\u2019s rail operations in Canada are subject to economic regulation by the Canadian Transportation Agency (the \"Agency\u201d) as delegated by the CTA. The CTA indirectly regulates rates by providing remedies for freight rates, including ancillary charges, remedies for level of service, long-haul interswitching rates, and regulated interswitching rates in Canada. The Agency administers the MRE program for the movement of export grain and makes determinations in relation to the construction and abandonment of railways, commuter and passenger access, and noise and vibration-related disputes. \nIn 2018, the Transportation Modernization Act became law. The legislation amended the Canada Transportation Act and the Railway Safety Act (\"RSA\"), among other Acts, to (1) replace the previous 160 kilometre extended interswitching limit and the competitive line rate provisions with a new long-haul interswitching regime\u037e (2) modify the existing Level of Service remedy for shippers by instructing the Agency to determine, upon receipt of a complaint, if a railway company is fulfilling its common carrier obligation to the \u201chighest level of service that is reasonable in the circumstances\u201d\u037e (3) allow the existing Service Level Agreement arbitration remedy to include the consideration of reciprocal financial penalties\u037e (4) increase the threshold for summary Final Offer Arbitration from $750,000 to $2 million\u037e (5) bifurcate the Volume-Related Composite Price Index component of the annual MRE determination for transportation of regulated grain, to encourage hopper car investment by CP and Canadian National Railway (\"CN\")\u037e (6) mandate the installation of locomotive voice and video recorders (\"LVVRs\"), with statutory permission for random access by railway companies and Transport Canada (\"TC\") to the LVVR data in order to proactively strengthen railway safety in Canada\u037e and (7) compel railways to provide additional data to the federal government.\nEconomic Regulation - U.S.\nThe Company\u2019s U.S. rail operations are subject to economic regulation by the STB. The STB provides economic regulatory oversight and administers Title 49 of the United States Code and related Code of Federal Regulations. The STB has jurisdiction over railroad rate and service issues and proposed railroad mergers and other transactions.\nThe STB Reauthorization Act of 2015 resulted in numerous changes to the structure and composition of the STB, removing it from under the Department of Transport and establishing the STB as an independent U.S. agency, as well as increasing STB Board membership from three to five members. Notably, the law vests in the STB certain limited enforcement powers, by authorizing it to investigate rail carrier violations on the STB Board\u2019s own initiative. The law also requires the STB to establish a voluntary binding arbitration process to resolve rail rate and practice disputes.\nSafety Regulation - Canada\nThe Company\u2019s operations in Canada are subject to safety regulatory oversight by TC pursuant to the RSA. The RSA regulates safety-related aspects of railway operations in Canada, including the delegation of inspection, investigation and enforcement powers to TC. TC is also responsible for overseeing the transportation of dangerous goods as set out under the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act (\"TDGA\").\nIn 2015, An Act to amend the Canada Transportation Act and the Railway Safety Act became law. The legislation sets out minimum insurance requirements for federally regulated railways based on amounts of crude and toxic inhalation hazards (\"TIH\") or poisonous inhalation hazards moved. It also imposes strict liability\u037e limits railway liability to the minimum insurance level\u037e mandates the creation of a fund paid for by levies on crude shipments, to be utilized for damages beyond a railway's liability\u037e allows railways and insurers to maintain rights to pursue other parties (subrogation)\u037e and prevents shifting liability to shippers from railways except through written agreement.\nThe Company is continuing to allocate resources, including working with public and private rail crossing owners, to meet the \nGrade Crossings Regulations\n, under the Railway Safety Act (\"RSA\"), which came into force in 2014. The regulations require existing crossings to meet specified safety standards by November 2021. Based on stakeholder input, including public and private rail crossing owners, TC has proposed changes to the regulations that will revise the scope and compliance deadlines using a risk-based approach. For crossings considered to be high priority, the deadline would be extended by one year (until November 28, 2022), and for all other crossings (i.e. crossings that do not meet the threshold criteria for low-risk or high priority) by three years (until November 28, 2024). The proposed regulatory changes are pending and will need to be published in Part II of the Canada Gazette for them to come into force.\nOn November 25, 2020, the Minister of Transport approved updated \nDuty and Rest Period Rules for Railway Operating Employees\n. The new rules, founded on modern-day fatigue management principles, reduce the length of a duty period and increase the length of the minimum rest period between shifts. The rules establish limits on the total number of duty hours, 60 hours in a seven-day period, 192 hours in a 28-day period and require the implementation of a Fatigue Management Plan and Fitness of Duty Provision. These requirements must be phased in by May 25, 2023. CP is working to address the requirements.\n17 \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT  \n \nOn July 11, 2021, the Minister of Transport issued an Order in response to the B.C. wildfires. The Order mandated prescriptive requirements that railway companies must comply with including conducting at least 10 fire detection patrols every 24 hours on regularly used track, an Extreme Weather Fire Risk Mitigation Plan, minimum emergency response requirements and locomotive inspection requirements. The requirements of the Order remain in effect until fire risk reduction measures are incorporated on a permanent basis into the existing regulatory framework governing railway operations in Canada.\nOn October 29, 2021, the Minister of Transport issued an Order mandating COVID-19 vaccinations. That Order required railway companies to implement their own company-wide vaccine policy by October 30, 2021 requiring all employees to receive their first dose of vaccine by November 15, 2021 and their second dose by January 24, 2022 or implement a set of more prescribed standards for operating employees. CP is complying with this Order and continuing to evaluate the potential impacts to the Company.\nAdditionally, the Company is working with TC on revisions to multiple rules to improve rail safety, including addressing specific requirements mandated under various Orders issued by the Minister of Transport. This includes changes to the \nCanadian Rail Operating Rules\n; \nRules Respecting Key Trains\n and \nKey Routes\n;\n Railway Locomotive Inspection\n and S\nafety Rules and Rules Respecting Track Safety\n.\nOn February 5, 2022, TC published a Notice of Intent in the Canada Gazette Part I that it would be progressing work to develop a regulatory framework to establish requirements to implement Enhanced Train Control (\"ETC\") technologies in Canada to help ensure that railway signals are consistently recognized and followed.  The Notice of Intent describes an approach that is based on extensive work conducted with railways and labour representatives. The proposed framework would require railway companies to assess the levels of safety risk on their networks and implement systems that are commensurate with the identified levels of risk. Highest risk corridors would need to be equipped with Automatic Train Protection equipment, similar to Positive Train Control (\"PTC\") in the US; lower risk corridors would need to be equipped with Driver Advisory System equipment that would alert crews to take action; and very low risk corridors could retain conventional train control approaches. The formal regulatory process has not commenced and railway companies will have opportunities to provide input into the proposed regulatory framework as it progresses. At this time, TC has not provided timelines for issuing proposed ETC regulatory requirements or an implementation date.\nSafety Regulation - U.S.\nThe Company\u2019s U.S. operations are subject to safety regulations enforced by the Federal Railroad Administration (\u201cFRA\u201d), and the Pipelines and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (\u201cPHMSA\u201d). The FRA regulates safety-related aspects of the Company\u2019s railway operations in the U.S. under the\n Federal Railroad Safety Act\n, as well as rail portions of other safety statutes. The PHMSA regulates the safe transportation of all hazardous materials by rail.\nVarious other regulators directly and indirectly affect the Company\u2019s operations in areas such as health, safety, security, environmental, and other matters.\nEnvironmental Laws and Regulations\nThe Company\u2019s operations and real estate assets are subject to extensive federal, provincial, state, and local environmental laws and regulations governing air pollutants, GHG emissions, management and remediation of historical contaminant sites, discharges to waters and the handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and other materials. If the Company is found to have violated such laws or regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, or operating results. In addition, in operating a railway, it is possible that releases of hazardous materials during derailments or other accidents may occur that could cause harm to human health or to the environment. Costs of remediation, damages and changes in regulations could materially affect the Company\u2019s operating results, financial condition, and reputation.\nThe Company has implemented an Environmental Management System to facilitate the reduction of environmental risk. Specific environmental programs are in place to address areas such as locomotive air emissions, GHG reporting, management of vegetation, wastewater, chemicals and waste, storage tanks, and fueling facilities. CP has also undertaken environmental impact assessments and risk assessments to identify, prevent, and mitigate environmental risks. There is continued focus on preventing spills and other incidents that have a negative impact on the environment. There is an established strategic emergency response contractor network, and spill equipment kits are located across Canada and the U.S. to ensure a rapid and efficient response in the event of an environmental incident. In addition, emergency preparedness and response plans are regularly updated and tested.\nThe Company has developed an environmental audit program that comprehensively, systematically, and regularly assesses the Company\u2019s facilities for compliance with legal requirements and the Company\u2019s policies for conformance to accepted industry standards. Included in this is a corrective action follow-up process and review by senior management.\nCP focuses on key strategies, identifying tactics and actions to support and operationalize our environmental commitments. The Company\u2019s strategies include:\n\u2022\nImplementing measures to minimize or prevent environmental impacts from our operations and facilities, and to ensure compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations;\n \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT\n \n \n18\n\u2022\nMaintaining an Environmental Management System to provide consistent, effective guidance and resources to CP employees in regard to the management of air emissions, dangerous goods and waste materials, emergency preparedness and response, petroleum products management, and water and wastewater systems;\n\u2022\nReducing environmental and safety risk through business processes to identify and mitigate potential environmental impacts related to all CP operations and activities;\n\u2022\nEnsuring that new or altered operations and other business activities are evaluated, planned, permitted in accordance with applicable regulations, and executed to mitigate environmental risk; \n\u2022\nEngaging with relevant stakeholders to consider and discuss CP\u2019s environmental management practices and environmental issues and concerns associated with our operations;\n\u2022\nEmploying best practices, proven technologies, and safe operating standards for activities involving elevated environmental risk; \n\u2022\nPlanning and preparing for emergency responses to ensure all appropriate steps are taken in the event of a derailment, spill, or other incident involving a release to the environment; and\n\u2022\nImplementing CP\u2019s comprehensive Climate Strategy to reduce GHG emissions and adapt CP\u2019s operations to the physical risks of climate change. To guide implementation of the Climate Strategy, CP has established two science-based emissions reduction targets that address 100% of CP\u2019s Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, and more than half of CP's Scope 3 emissions. \nSecurity\nCP is subject to statutory and regulatory directives in Canada and the U.S. that address security concerns. CP plays a critical role in the North American transportation system. Rail lines, facilities and equipment, including railcars carrying hazardous materials, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks, actions by criminal and non-criminal organizations, and activities by individuals. Regulations by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Department of Homeland Security in the U.S. include speed restrictions, chain of custody and security measures, which can impact service and increase costs for the transportation of hazardous materials, especially TIH materials. New regulations published by TC under the TGDA have added requirements for railway companies to take actions to mitigate security risks of transporting dangerous goods by rail. In addition, insurance premiums for some or all of the Company\u2019s current coverage could increase significantly, or certain coverage may not be available to the Company in the future. While CP will continue to work closely with Canadian and U.S. government agencies, future decisions by these agencies on security matters or decisions by the industry in response to security threats to the North American rail network could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, or operating results.\n\u00a0\nCP takes the following security measures:\n\u2022\nCP employs its own\u00a0police service\u00a0that works closely with communities and other law enforcement\u00a0and government agencies to promote railway safety and infrastructure security. As a railway law enforcement agency, CP Police Services is headquartered in Calgary, with police officers assigned to over 25 field offices responsible for railway police operations in six Canadian provinces and 14 U.S. states. CP Police Services operates\u00a0on the CP rail network as well as\u00a0in\u00a0areas where CP has\u00a0non-railway operations;\n\u2022\nCP\u2019s Public Safety Communication Centre (\"PSCC\") operates 24 hours a day. PSCC receives reports of emergencies, dangerous or potentially dangerous conditions, and other safety and security issues from our employees, the public, and law enforcement and other government officials. PSCC ensures that proper emergency responders are notified as well as governing bodies;\n\u2022\nCP\u2019s Security Management Plan is a comprehensive, risk-based plan modelled on and developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the Association of American Railroads post-September 11, 2001.\u00a0Under this plan, CP routinely examines and prioritizes railway assets, physical and cyber vulnerabilities, and threats, as well as tests and revises measures to provide essential railway security. To address cyber security risks, CP implements mitigation programs that evolve with the changing technology threat environment. The Company has also worked diligently to establish backup sites to ensure a seamless transition in the event that the Company's operating systems are the target of a cyber-attack. By doing so, CP is able to maintain network fluidity; and\n\u2022\nCP security efforts consist of a wide variety of measures including employee training, periodic security assessments, engagement with our customers, and training of emergency responders. \n19 \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT  \n \nFocus on Sustainability\nSustainability at CP is rooted in a long-standing legacy of building for the future. We recognize that integrating sustainability into our business processes is imperative to future growth and long-term success as an organization. As one of North America\u2019s top-performing railways, we seek to continue to innovate and advance practices to meet the evolving needs and increasing engagement of all of CP\u2019s stakeholders, including employees, customers, shareholders, suppliers, communities and society.\nCP's Sustainability Priorities\nSustainability Governance\nCP's Board of Directors, through its committees, is responsible for the monitoring, measurement and oversight of CP's key risks, strategies and sustainability topics. The Risk and Sustainability Committee of the Board reviews performance against short-term and long-term sustainability objectives and results of stakeholder engagement to ensure alignment with CP\u2019s strategic planning. CP\u2019s cross-functional management Sustainability Steering Committee guides decisions on CP\u2019s day-to-day sustainability tasks, programs and priorities, and reports progress and recommendations to the Risk and Sustainability Committee. The Disclosure Policy Committee gives direction and support to the Sustainability Steering Committee concerning how CP communicates information concerning material sustainability topics. \nCP leadership and employee engagement at all levels of the business is foundational to the success of our sustainability program. Through ongoing engagement across and beyond our organization, CP continues to refine a sustainability program driven by our values and based on a shared sense of business, community and vision for the future. As we take strides to deliver on our commitments and goals, we constantly challenge ourselves to improve our practices.\nClimate Change\nClimate change represents a significant global challenge and CP is committed to adapting our business and operations. CP published its first Climate Strategy in 2021, outlining our approach to managing potential climate-related impacts, reducing our carbon footprint and seeking to position CP as an industry leader in the transition to a low-carbon future. As part of the Climate Strategy, CP established science-based GHG emissions reductions targets covering 100% of Scope 1 and 2 emissions and more than half of our Scope 3 emissions. \nCP has already taken action and made progress on climate change and to further support the execution of our Climate Strategy, we are strengthening roles and responsibilities for climate governance. CP's President and CEO holds the highest level of responsibility for organizational management, \n \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT\n \n \n20\nincluding oversight of the Sustainability Steering Committee and performance related to climate change, while the Risk and Sustainability Committee of the Board provides oversight and reviews climate-related risks and opportunities. To lead our focus on decarbonization, we have established a Carbon Reduction Task Force, composed of CP\u2019s industry-leading engineers and operations experts. The Carbon Reduction Task Force reports to the Sustainability Steering Committee and will evaluate, recommend and implement climate action measures to reduce our GHG emissions and drive performance in the direction of our science-based targets.\nIn 2021, CP significantly expanded its Hydrogen Locomotive Program, aiming to build North America\u2019s first line-haul hydrogen-powered locomotive using fuel cells and batteries to power the locomotive\u2019s electric traction motor. CP is increasing the number of hydrogen locomotive conversions from one to three and adding hydrogen production and fueling facilities. This project will demonstrate and evaluate the technical performance in real-world operations and generate critical industry knowledge and experience that will inform commercialization and future development.\nIn 2021, we aligned our reporting to include the recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (\"TCFD\") and issued our first TCFD Index to demonstrate CP's full alignment to the recommendations. In addition, we regularly report on climate-related efforts through CDP and supplemental sustainability disclosures. \nIndigenous Relations\nWe strive to maintain strong relationships with Indigenous communities and uphold policies that outline our commitment to human rights. We incorporate elements of the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business\u2019 Progressive Aboriginal Relations program into our practices and aim to strengthen relationships, develop opportunities and provide education and cross-cultural awareness.\nCP recognizes the constitutionally protected rights of Indigenous people and is committed to interacting with Indigenous communities in a safe, respectful and responsible manner. Various CP teams collaborate to make certain that we effectively communicate and engage with communities that may be impacted by our practices and projects.\nHuman Capital Management\nCP is focused on attracting, developing, and retaining a resilient, high-performing workforce that delivers on providing service for our customers. CP's culture is guided by three core values: Accountability, Diversity, and Pride. These values drive our actions. Everything we do is grounded in precision scheduled railroading and our five foundations of Provide Service, Control Costs, Optimize Assets, Operate Safely, and Develop People. \nAt CP, our approximately 12,000-strong team of railroaders across North America underpins CP\u2019s success and brings value to our customers and shareholders. Accordingly, Develop People is one foundation of how we do business, illustrating our focus and energy towards empowering our people, providing an engaging culture and cultivating an industry leading team.  \nTotal Employees and Workforce\n \nAn employee is defined by the Company as an individual currently engaged in full-time, part-time, or seasonal employment with CP. The total number of employees as of December 31, 2021, was 11,834, a decrease of 56 compared to 11,890 as at December 31, 2020.\nWorkforce is defined as total employees plus contractors and consultants. The total workforce as at December\u00a031, 2021 was 11,872, a decrease of 32 compared to 11,904 as at December\u00a031, 2020.\nUnionized Workforce\nClass I railways are party to collective bargaining agreements with various labour unions. The majority of CP's employees belong to labour unions and are subject to these agreements. CP manages collaborative relationships with union members in both Canada and the U.S.\nCP employs approximately 12,000 active employees across North America with three-quarters based in Canada and the remainder in the United States. Unionized employees represent nearly 73% of our workforce and are represented by 36 active bargaining units. \nCanada\nWithin Canada there are eight bargaining units representing approximately 6,600 Canadian unionized active employees. From time to time, we negotiate to renew collective agreements with various unionized groups of employees. In such cases, the collective agreements remain in effect until the bargaining process has been exhausted (pursuant to the \nCanada Labour Code\n). One agreement is open for renewal and negotiations are underway as at December 31, 2021. Agreements are in place with the other seven bargaining units in Canada. Four collective agreements are effective until December 31, 2022 with the remaining three effective until December 31, 2023, 2025 and 2026. \n21 \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT  \n \nU.S.\nIn the U.S., there are currently 28 active bargaining units on four subsidiary railroads representing nearly 2,100 unionized active employees. 24 agreements are open for amendment and under negotiation as at December 31, 2021. Negotiations have been concluded with respect to three agreements which will expire beyond 2022 while one remaining agreement will be open for amendment in 2022.\nHealth and Safety\nCP is an industry leader in rail safety and we are committed to protecting our employees, our communities, our environment, and our customers\u2019 goods. In spite of 2021 being a very challenging year for our operation, CP remained an industry leader in train accident statistics for the 16\nth\n consecutive year. 2021 was also a record breaking year with respect to personal injuries as CP had the lowest injury frequency in its history and is now among the Class I leaders. CP's leadership approach has been the most impactful driver of the strong safety performance metrics and we are committed to continually improving on them. Aside from running trains, many of our employees work in yards, terminals and shops across our network with machinery and heavy equipment, or in extreme weather conditions. Their safety and security are of utmost importance to CP and are integral to the way we view employee safety education and training. Operate Safely is one of our five foundations of successful railroading and it starts with knowing and following the rules. \nCP HomeSafe is an initiative designed to improve our safety culture by tapping into the human side of safety and promoting both safety engagement and feedback. HomeSafe puts everyone on the same level and empowers all employees to begin a safety conversation, no matter the rank or position. We intend to continue strengthening our strong HomeSafe foundation in 2022 through active peer engagement and awareness initiatives. Despite the ongoing pandemic in 2021, CP has continued to maintain a safe operation by diligently promoting our pandemic response initiatives including a set of practical strategies and best practices designed to keep all employees safe and healthy at work. \nSafety performance is disclosed publicly on a quarterly basis using standardized metrics set out by the FRA. Additional information on FRA safety measures is included in Performance Indicators in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nTalent Management\nCP\u2019s approach for talent management begins with our Human Resources department, which oversees recruitment, development, engagement, and retention with the current and future workforce and leadership of CP. \nThe Management Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviews and informs CP\u2019s compensation plan and programming, and makes recommendations to the Board on succession planning for senior management and processes to identify, develop, and retain executive talent. Additionally, as part of CP\u2019s succession planning program, senior leaders are actively engaged in building the pool of future leaders, and present their development plans to the Board.\nCP maintains a number of internal policies and processes related to recruitment, relocation, compensation, employment equity, and diversity and inclusion. The effective implementation of these policies alongside our ongoing workforce initiatives ensures CP\u2019s attraction and recruitment, employee development, succession, engagement, and diversity and inclusion practices are consistent and aligned with CP\u2019s commitments, foundations and values.\nAttraction and Recruitment\nWith a rail network spanning Canada and the U.S., we employ a number of recruitment strategies and retention tactics to attract and retain talent across North America. CP offers many rewarding career opportunities in a variety of roles within the organization in both operating and support functions. We base our recruitment strategy on workforce planning needs, and our focus is on ensuring that we have a diverse candidate pool to fill our open positions.\nCP recognizes the valuable skills and experience that veterans have gained from serving their country. Our veteran program was recognized as part of Canada's Best Diversity Employers\u00ae of 2021 and we were named part of the top 10 Military Friendly\u00ae employers in the U.S. for 2021. \nCP tracks recruitment performance and success rates to better understand which tactics, benefits, and strategic partnerships are most successful in bringing in and retaining new talent.\nTalent Development & Succession\nAs part of our core foundation and commitment to Develop People, we encourage all employees to take an active role in their career planning and development. We believe that investing in our employees leads to improved workplace morale and fosters a supportive working environment.    \nTraining and Development\nOne of CP\u2019s five foundations is to Develop People, which is integral to the way we do business at the railway. Our strategy involves delivering specialized training, best practices, and skill-broadening opportunities to all employees.   \n \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT\n \n \n22\nCP offers a variety of training opportunities, providing both technical/on-the-job training, role-specific offerings as well as optional courses. Training includes instructor-led classes and online on-demand, self-directed online learning.  \nNon-union employees also complete annual performance management and development action plans with their leaders to set individual goals tied to CP's five key foundations and track progress against Company expectations as well as career development goals. \nDiversity and Inclusion\nDiversity is one of our core values at CP. We believe that different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives enhance creativity and innovation and encourage diversity of thought in the workplace. Fostering an inclusive environment where all employees feel empowered to strive for and achieve success supports our high-performance culture and is integral to our growth and success as an organization. Our Diversity and Inclusion team with support from senior leadership is responsible for developing programs and initiatives to achieve our diversity commitments. We are continually working on programs and opportunities to ensure we are attracting, retaining and developing the best people and skill sets for CP. CP is committed to increasing diversity throughout all levels of the organization.\nCP recognizes the importance of Board member diversity as a critical component of objective oversight and continuous improvement. As of December 31, 2021, five of the 11 directors (45%) are women. Additionally, one of our male directors is a visible minority, which makes the majority of the Board of Directors (54.5%) members of \"designated groups\" as defined in the Employment Equity Act of Canada.\nCP has regulatory requirements to report on workforce diversity representation in Canada (Employment Equity Act) and the U.S. (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission). CP currently collects diversity data on the following categories: women, persons with disabilities, minorities (visible minorities), and Indigenous peoples (Canada) from employees through voluntary self-disclosure. CP continues to focus our efforts on attracting, recruiting, and developing a diverse workforce. This data is shared in various disclosures and government reporting, internally with employees and leaders as well as our Board of Directors.  \nYear over Year Diversity Representation\nCanada and U.S. Diversity Percentages\n(1)\n2021\n2020\n2019\nWomen\n10\n\u00a0\n%\n10\u00a0\n%\n10\u00a0\n%\nPersons with disabilities\n3\n\u00a0\n%\n3\u00a0\n%\n3\u00a0\n%\nMinorities (visible minorities)\n(2)\n14\n\u00a0\n%\n13\u00a0\n%\n13\u00a0\n%\nIndigenous peoples (Canada only)\n3\n\u00a0\n%\n3\u00a0\n%\n4\u00a0\n%\n(1)\n Percentages are based on total workforce (total number of active employees) at year-end.\n(2)\n Minority is a term used in the U.S., Visible Minority is a term used in Canada.\nCP continues to work collaboratively with our employees, communities along our network, and partner organizations in Canada and the U.S. to progress and support CP\u2019s commitment toward a more representative and inclusive workplace. Some of our initiatives include:\n\u2022\nEstablishing three diversity councils (Indigenous, Gender and Racial). Each council is chaired by a CP executive and represents a diverse group of employees. The councils work to ensure we consider diversity and inclusion when we make decisions, provide feedback on corporate directions and promote initiatives that relate to each council\u2019s area of focus;\n\u2022\nContinuing our existing partnerships with associations and organizations that attract, recruit, and support skilled immigrants, transitioning veterans, persons with disabilities, and women;\n\u2022\nWorking with Indigenous groups to develop relationships that are more meaningful, create targeted outreach programs and employment opportunities, and better understand their history, culture, and opportunities for collaboration;\n\u2022\nSupporting the development and advancement of women at CP; and\n\u2022\nIncreasing employee awareness regarding CP\u2019s workplace diversity and inclusion practices through communications, education, and training.\nFurther, in 2020 CP published a Diversity Commitment. This commitment re-enforces the efforts we have made, and will continue to make, in our journey to becoming a more diverse and inclusive company, one that we and those we do business with are proud to be a part. \nWe pride ourselves on offering a diverse workplace with a variety of careers in both our corporate and field locations. We recruit and hire talent based on relevant skills and experience, and seek to attract the highest quality candidates regardless of gender, age, cultural heritage, or ethnic origin. One of our primary objectives is attracting, recruiting, retaining, and developing a workforce representative of the communities in which we operate. \n23 \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT  \n \nAvailable Information\nCP makes available on or through its website www.cpr.ca free of charge, its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the \nExchange Act\n as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d). Our website also contains charters for each of the committees of our Board of Directors, our corporate governance guidelines and our Code of Business Ethics. This Form 10-K and other SEC filings made by CP are also accessible through the SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov.\nAll references to our websites contained herein do not constitute incorporation by reference of information contained on such websites and such information should not be considered part of this document.\n \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT\n \n \n24", "item1a": ">ITEM 1A. \nRISK FACTORS \nThe risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Company's forward-looking statements and forward-looking information (collectively, \"forward-looking statements\"). \nThe information set forth in this Item 1A. Risk Factors should be read in conjunction with the rest of the information included in this annual report, including Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect the Company's business and operating results. \nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer demand resulted in lower volumes in several of the Company's lines of business, including Energy, chemicals and plastics, Metals, minerals and consumer products, and Automotive. The future impacts of COVID-19 on the Company's business or operating and financial results are unpredictable and cannot be identified or assessed with certainty at this time. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the global economy and resulted in a widespread economic downturn which has adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact demand for our services and otherwise cause interruptions, including fluctuations to commodity prices, disruptions or restrictions on the ability to transport freight in the ordinary course, temporary closures of facilities and ports, or the facilities and ports of our customers, partners, suppliers or other third-party service providers, and/or changes to export/import restrictions. The pandemic caused by COVID-19 has impacted and may continue to impact the seasonal trends that typically characterize our revenues and operating income. There is no assurance that the outbreak will not continue to have a material and adverse impact on our business or results of operations. Additionally, our operations could be further negatively affected if a significant number of our employees are unable to perform their normal duties, including because of contracting COVID-19 or based on further direction from governments, public health authorities or regulatory agencies. The extent of the impact, if any, will depend on developments, many of which are beyond our control, including actions taken by governments, financial institutions, monetary policy authorities, and public health authorities to contain and respond to public health concerns and general economic conditions as a result of the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic may also result in continued substantial market volatility and declines, which could adversely impact future net periodic benefit costs and funding requirements of CP\u2019s pension plans. Furthermore, certain impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including demand for our services and to economic conditions generally, could continue following the pandemic or the expiration or termination of government actions in respect of the pandemic.\nWe will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required or recommended by federal, provincial, state or local authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, shareholders and other stakeholders. We cannot be certain of potential effects that any such alterations or modifications may have on our business or operating and financial results in future fiscal periods.\nTo the extent COVID-19 adversely affects our business or operating and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described above and below. In addition, we could be materially and adversely affected by other public health crises, including another widespread epidemic or pandemic.\nCOVID-19 vaccine mandates could negatively impact our ability to retain employees and could increase our operational costs, which could in turn adversely affect our profitability and growth. \nOn October 29, 2021, the Minister of Transport issued an Order mandating COVID-19 vaccinations. That Order requires railway companies in Canada to implement their own company-wide vaccine policy by October 30, 2021 requiring all employees receive their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine by November 15, 2021 and their second dose by January 24, 2022 or implement a set of more prescribed standards for operating employees. The Order also requires that railway companies place non-compliant employees on unpaid leave. CP is complying with this Order and continuing to evaluate the potential impacts to the company.\nPresident Biden\u2019s COVID-19 Action Plan announced in September 2021 instructed the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") to develop a rule that would require all employers with 100 or more employees to ensure their workforce is fully vaccinated or subjected to weekly testing. On January 13, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed implementation of OSHA's vaccine or test requirement. As a result, OSHA withdrew its vaccination and testing emergency standards. However, there could be similar vaccination mandates in the U.S. in the future which could negatively impact our ability to retain employees, and increase our operational costs. An increase in expenses and operational costs could materially and adversely affect our growth and profitability.\nCOVID-19 vaccine mandates may affect employee availability due to absences to get vaccinated and/or unpaid leaves, coping with side-effects, union work stoppages and/or employee resignations due to refusal to comply with a mandate. COVID-19 vaccine mandates in Canada could negatively impact our ability to retain employees, and increase our operational costs. An increase in expenses and operational costs could materially and adversely affect our growth and profitability.\n25 \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT  \n \nAs a common carrier in Canada and the U.S., the Company is required by law to transport dangerous goods and hazardous materials, which could expose the Company to significant costs and claims.\n \nRailways, including CP, are legally required to transport dangerous goods and hazardous materials as part of their common carrier obligations regardless of risk or potential exposure to loss. CP transports dangerous goods and hazardous materials, including but not limited to crude oil, ethanol and TIH materials such as chlorine gas and anhydrous ammonia. A train accident involving hazardous materials could result in significant claims against CP arising from personal injury, property or natural resource damage, environmental penalties and remediation obligations. Such claims, if insured, could exceed the existing insurance coverage commercially available to CP, which could have a material adverse effect on CP\u2019s financial condition, operating results, and liquidity. CP is also required to comply with rules and regulations regarding the handling of dangerous goods and hazardous materials in Canada and the U.S. Noncompliance with these rules and regulations can subject the Company to significant penalties and could factor in litigation arising out of a train accident. Changes to these rules and regulations could also increase operating costs, reduce operating efficiencies and impact service delivery. \nThe Company faces competition from other transportation providers and failure to compete effectively could adversely affect financial results.\n \nThe Company faces significant competition for freight transportation in Canada and the U.S., including competition from other railways, motor carriers, ship and barge operators, and pipelines. Competition is based mainly on quality of service, freight rates and access to markets. Other transportation modes generally use public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by government entities, while CP and other railways must use internal resources to build and maintain their rail networks. Competition with the trucking industry is generally based on freight rates, flexibility of service and transit time performance. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation, or legislation that eliminates or significantly reduces the burden of the size or weight limitations currently applicable to trucking carriers, could have a material adverse effect on CP's financial results.\nThe operations of carriers with which the Company interchanges may adversely affect operations. The Company's ability to provide rail services to customers in Canada and the U.S. also depends upon its ability to maintain cooperative relationships with connecting carriers with respect to, among other matters, revenue division, car supply and locomotive availability, data exchange and communications, reciprocal switching, interchange, and trackage rights. Deterioration in the operations or services provided by connecting carriers, or in the Company's relationship with those connecting carriers, could result in CP's inability to meet customers' demands or require the Company to use alternate train routes, which could result in significant additional costs and network inefficiencies and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe Company may be affected by acts of terrorism, war, or risk of war.\n \nCP plays a critical role in the North American transportation system and therefore could become the target for acts of terrorism or war. CP is also involved in the transportation of hazardous materials, which could result in CP's equipment or infrastructure being direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks. Acts of terrorism, or other similar events, any government response thereto, and war or risk of war could cause significant business interruption to CP and may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. \nThe Company may be affected by fluctuating fuel prices.\n \nFuel expense constitutes a significant portion of the Company\u2019s operating costs. Fuel prices can be subject to dramatic fluctuations, and significant price increases could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. The Company currently employs a fuel cost adjustment program to help reduce volatility in changing fuel prices, but the Company cannot be certain that it will always be able to fully mitigate rising or elevated fuel costs through this program. Factors affecting fuel prices include worldwide oil demand, international politics, weather, refinery capacity, supplier and upstream outages, unplanned infrastructure failures, environmental and sustainability policies, and labour and political instability. \nThe Company relies on technology and technological improvements to operate its business and we are subject to cybersecurity risks.\n \nInformation technology is critical to all aspects of CP\u2019s business, and the Company relies on technology systems operated by us or under control of third parties. Although the Company devotes significant resources to protect its technology systems and proprietary data, there can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect such incidents or attacks, or to avoid a material adverse impact on our systems after such incidents or attacks do occur. The Company is continually evaluating attackers\u2019 techniques and tactics, and the Company is diligent in its monitoring, training, planning, and prevention. However, due to the increasing sophistication of cyber-attacks and greater complexity in our IT supply chain, the Company may be unable to anticipate or implement appropriate preventive measures to detect and respond to a security breach. This includes the raising rates of reported ransomware events, increased human error, or other cyber-attack methods disrupting CP\u2019s systems or the systems of third parties. If the Company or third parties whose technology systems we rely on were to experience a significant disruption or failure of one or more of their information technology or communications systems (either as a result of an intentional cyber or malicious act, or an unintentional error) it could result in significant service interruptions or other failures, safety failures, other operational difficulties unauthorized access to, the loss of access to or misappropriation of competitively sensitive, confidential or other critical information or systems, loss of customers, financial losses, regulatory fines, and misuse or corruption of critical data and proprietary information, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. The Company also may experience security breaches that could remain undetected for an extended period and, therefore, have a greater impact on the services we offer. In addition, if CP is unable to acquire or implement new technology in general, the Company may suffer a competitive disadvantage, which could also have an adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT\n \n \n26\nHuman Capital Risks\nThe availability of qualified personnel could adversely affect the Company's operations.\n \nChanges in employee demographics, training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel, particularly locomotive engineers and trainpersons, could negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to meet demand for rail services. Unpredictable increases in the demand for rail services may increase the risk of having insufficient numbers of trained personnel, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, changes in operations and other technology improvements may significantly impact the number of employees required to meet the demand for rail services.\nStrikes or work stoppages could adversely affect the Company's operations.\n \nClass I railways are party to collective bargaining agreements with various labour unions. The majority of CP's employees belong to labour unions and are subject to these agreements. Disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or the Company's potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns or lockouts, which could cause a significant disruption of the Company's operations and have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Additionally, future national labour agreements, or provisions of labour agreements related to health care, could significantly increase the Company's costs for health and welfare benefits, which could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and liquidity. \nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nThe Company is subject to significant governmental legislation and regulation over commercial, operating and environmental matters.\n \nThe Company\u2019s railway operations are subject to extensive federal laws, regulations and rules in both Canada and the U.S. Operations are subject to economic and safety regulations in Canada primarily by the Agency and TC. The Company\u2019s U.S. operations are subject to economic and safety regulation by the STB and the FRA. The STB regulates routes, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, rates for non-exempt traffic, acquisitions of control over rail common carriers and the transfer, extension or abandonment of rail lines, among other railroad activities. Any new rules from the STB regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity as well as its ability to invest in enhancing and maintaining vital infrastructure. Various other regulators, including the FRA, and its sister agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation (\"DOT\"), the PHMSA, directly and indirectly affect the Company\u2019s operations in areas such as health, safety, security, environmental and other matters. Together, FRA and PHMSA have broad jurisdiction over railroad operating standards and practices, including track, freight cars, locomotives and hazardous materials requirements. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) has regulatory authority with respect to matters that impact the Company's properties and operations. Additional regulation of the rail industry by these regulators or the Canadian and U.S. federal and state or provincial legislative bodies, whether under new or existing laws, may result in increased capital expenditures and operating costs and could have a significant negative impact on the Company\u2019s ability to determine prices for rail services and result in a material adverse effect in the future on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity in a particular year or quarter. This potential material adverse effect could also result in reduced capital spending on the Company\u2019s rail network or in abandonment of lines.\nThe Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs. \nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to extensive federal, state, provincial (Canada) and local environmental laws concerning, among other matters, emissions to the air, land and water and the handling of hazardous materials and wastes. Violation of these laws and regulations can result in significant fines and penalties, as well as other potential impacts on CP\u2019s operations. These laws can impose strict, and in some circumstances, joint and several liability on both current and former owners, and on operators of facilities. Such environmental liabilities may also be raised by adjacent landowners or third parties. In addition, in operating a railway, it is possible that releases of hazardous materials during derailments or other accidents may occur that could cause harm to human health or to the environment. Costs of remediation, damages and changes in regulations could materially affect the Company\u2019s operating results and reputation. The Company has been, and may in the future be, subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations. The Company currently has obligations at existing sites for investigation, remediation and monitoring, and will likely have obligations at other sites in the future. The actual costs associated with both current and long-term liabilities may vary from the Company\u2019s estimates due to a number of factors including, but not limited to changes in: the content or interpretation of environmental laws and regulations; required remedial actions; technology associated with site investigation or remediation; and the involvement and financial viability of other parties that may be responsible for portions of those liabilities.\nThe Company may be subject to litigation and other claims that could result in significant expenditures. \nBy nature of its operations, the Company is exposed to potential for litigation and other claims, including personal injury claims, labour and employment disputes, commercial and contract disputes, environmental liability, freight claims and property damage claims. Accruals are made in accordance with applicable accounting standards and based on an ongoing assessment of the likelihood of success of the claim together with an evaluation of the damages or other monetary relief sought. Material changes to litigation trends, a catastrophic rail incident or series of incidents involving freight loss, property damage, personal injury, environmental liability, or other claims, and other significant matters could have a material adverse impact to the Company's results of operations, financial position and liquidity, in each case, to the extent not covered by insurance.\nSupply Chain Risks\nDisruptions within the supply chain could negatively affect the Company's operational efficiencies and increase costs.\n \nThe North American transportation system is integrated. CP\u2019s operations and service may be negatively impacted by service disruptions of other transportation links, \n27 \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT  \n \nsuch as ports, handling facilities, customer facilities and other railways. A prolonged service disruption at one of these entities could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nThe Company is dependent on certain key suppliers of core railway equipment and materials that could result in increased price volatility or significant shortages of materials, which could adversely affect results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n \nDue to the complexity and specialized nature of core railway equipment and infrastructure (including rolling stock equipment, locomotives, rail and ties), there can be a limited number of suppliers of rail equipment and materials available. Should these specialized suppliers cease production or experience capacity or supply shortages, this concentration of suppliers could result in CP experiencing cost increases or difficulty in obtaining rail equipment and materials, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Additionally, CP\u2019s operations are dependent on the availability of diesel fuel. A significant fuel supply shortage arising from production decreases, increased demand in existing or emerging foreign markets, disruption of oil imports, disruption of domestic refinery production, damage to refinery or pipeline infrastructure, political unrest, war or other factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position and liquidity in a particular year or quarter.\nRisks Related to the Kansas City Southern Transaction\nFollowing the closing of the KCS acquisition into a voting trust, although the Company does not control KCS, KCS\u2019s operational and financial performance could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\n On December 14, 2021, the KCS acquisition closed into a voting trust, whereby the Company indirectly acquired a 100% beneficial ownership interest in KCS but does not control KCS. KCS\u2019s voting stock was deposited into a voting trust that insulates KCS from control by the Company. The Company will not control KCS until STB control approval is obtained. Until that time, KCS will be managed by its own executive team overseen by its own board of directors and the voting trust. \nThe voting trust precludes the Company from exercising control over the business strategy or other operational aspects of KCS. The Company\u2019s investment in this unconsolidated entity was considered significant under Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company cannot provide assurance that KCS will operate in a manner that will increase the value of the Company\u2019s investments, that the Company\u2019s income or losses from KCS will continue at the current level in the future or that the Company will not incur losses from KCS. Write-downs to the carrying amount of the Company\u2019s equity interest could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company incurred substantial indebtedness in connection with consummation of the acquisition, which may pose risks and/or intensify existing risks.\n Prior to the closing into voting trust that occurred on December 14, 2021, the Company incurred additional indebtedness of approximately U.S. $6.7\u00a0billion and $2.2\u00a0billion notes and a U.S. $500 million term loan to indirectly fund the acquisition.\nThe foregoing indebtedness, as well as any additional indebtedness we may incur, could have the effect, among other things, of reducing our liquidity and may limit our flexibility in responding to other business opportunities and increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions. \nOur ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic, financial and business conditions, sufficient cash flow from KCS during the period in which it is in the voting trust, the implementation of the integration with KCS (if the STB approves our assuming control of KCS) and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. \nOur increased indebtedness could also reduce funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages relative to other companies with lower debt levels. If we obtain control of KCS but we do not achieve the expected benefits and cost savings from the combination, or if the financial performance of the combined company does not meet current expectations, then our ability to service our indebtedness may be adversely impacted.\nThe agreements that govern the indebtedness that has been incurred in connection with the KCS acquisition, contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may, subject to certain customary exceptions, restrict our ability to, among other things, create liens over our property, change our line of business and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to another person. In addition, some of the agreements that govern our debt financings contain a financial covenant that will require us to maintain certain financial ratios. Various risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants and failure to comply with them could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations. Under these circumstances, we may not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations.\nMoreover, we may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements. Our ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all.\n \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT\n \n \n28\nThe pendency of the STB's regulatory review of the combination could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s businesses, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or the market value of the Company\u2019s common stock and debt securities.\n The pendency of the regulatory review of the combination could disrupt the Company\u2019s businesses, and uncertainty about the outcome of that review may have an adverse effect on the Company or the combined company. The attention of the Company\u2019s management may be directed towards obtaining final approval from the STB and addressing related requests from the third parties for conditions on STB approval and may be diverted from the day-to-day business operations of the Company. Matters related to the combination may require commitments of time and resources that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that might have been beneficial to the Company. Further, the combination may give rise to potential liabilities, including as a result of pending and future shareholder lawsuits relating to the combination. In addition, the Company has incurred, and expects to incur additional, material non-recurring expenses in connection with the completion of the combination. Any of these matters could adversely affect the businesses of, or harm the results of operations, financial condition or cash flows of the Company and the market value of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe combination is subject to final approval by the STB, and there can be no assurance as to whether and when it may be approved or if such approval will be granted with conditions applicable to the parties; accordingly, the combination may be delayed, jeopardized or prevented entirely and the anticipated benefits of the combination could be reduced.\n The STB has the authority to impose conditions on its approval of a control transaction to alleviate competitive and other public interest harm. If such conditions were imposed, the anticipated benefits of the combination might be reduced. There is no assurance that final approval from the STB will be obtained or obtained on terms acceptable to the Company.\nIn addition, the STB's review process allows railroad competitors of the Company and KCS and other interested parties to intervene to oppose the STB application or seek conditions in the event approval by the STB is granted, which might delay the approval process or reduce the anticipated benefits of the combination. On January 12, 2022, CN submitted a notice of intent to file a responsive application on February 28, 2022, with the STB. According to CN, its responsive application will ask the STB to condition any approval of a CP-KCS combination on the divestiture of KCS lines from Kansas City, Missouri to Springfield and East St. Louis, Illinois to CN, pursuant to the STB\u2019s statutory authority to order \u201cthe divestiture of parallel tracks\u201d as a merger condition. Furthermore, if the STB does not provide final approval or imposes conditions on its approval in a final order, and the Company and KCS decide to appeal such final order from the STB, any such appeal might not be resolved for a substantial period of time after the entry of such order by the STB.\nIf we determine in our reasonable judgment that the STB final approval will not be sought or has not or will not be received prior to March 25, 2023, then we will be required to redeem all of the outstanding 2.450% notes due 2031 and 3.000% notes due 2041 at a special mandatory redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the applicable notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The Company may not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy such repurchase obligation, which could have a significant adverse impact on the business and financial condition of the Company.\nIf either (i) final approval from the STB has not been obtained by December 31, 2023 or (ii) the STB has, by a final and non-appealable order, refused to provide final approval (an \u201cSTB denial\u201d), the Company would be required to dispose of its investment in KCS. Similarly, if the STB imposes onerous conditions on its final approval, the Company may choose to dispose of its investment in KCS rather than agreeing to the conditions imposed by the STB. In either case, the Company would be obligated under the voting trust agreement to directly or indirectly divest the trust stock in a manner that is acceptable to the STB. In the case of a divestiture, the market and divestiture alternatives for the trust stock might be limited, and such a disposition could cause the Company to incur significant losses and expenses in connection with the transaction, which could have a significant adverse impact on the business and financial condition of the Company.\nThe Company may be unable to integrate KCS successfully, and the Company may not experience the growth being sought from the combination.\n The Company and KCS have operated and, until the receipt of final approval from the STB, will continue to operate, independently. Integrating KCS with CP following STB approval of CP control will involve operational, technological and personnel-related challenges, which may be made more difficult in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. This process will be time-consuming and expensive, may disrupt the businesses of either or both of the companies and may reduce the growth opportunities sought from the combination.\nClimate-Related Risks\nThe Company has established greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets to guide the implementation of CP's Climate Strategy. CP's inability to achieve GHG emissions reduction targets could negatively impact both our reputation and financial results. \nCP has established two science-based GHG emissions reduction targets to address a substantial portion of the Company's Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions by 2030. The primary risks associated with achieving these commitments include but are not limited to future investments in and the availability of GHG emissions-reduction tools and technologies, CP's ability to work with governments and third parties to mitigate the impacts of climate change, domestic and international economic conditions, including exchange rates, the effects of competition and regulation, uncertainties in the financial markets, capital spending, actions of vendors, the willingness of customers to acquire our services, cost of network expansion, maintenance and retrofits, and physical impact of climate change on our business. Our targets are subject to the successful implementation of the actions and plans outlined in the Climate Strategy as well as the accuracy of the assumptions in the science-based methodology used to calculate these targets. We cannot assure that CP's plans to reduce GHG emissions will be viable or successful. Inability to meet GHG emissions reduction targets could have a material adverse effect on CP's reputation, results of operations or financial position.\n29 \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT  \n \nChanging climate conditions, severe weather or natural disasters could result in significant business interruptions and costs to the Company. \nCP is exposed to severe weather conditions and natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, avalanches, mudslides, extreme temperatures and significant precipitation that may cause track outages, severe damage to infrastructure and business interruptions that can adversely affect the Company\u2019s entire rail network. For example, the atmospheric river rain storm in British Columbia in November 2021 resulted in damage at more than 30 locations across CP\u2019s Thompson and Cascade subdivision with 20 locations experiencing a significant loss of infrastructure. These events can result in substantial costs to respond during the event and recover following the event. Costs can include modifications to existing infrastructure or implementation of new infrastructure to prevent future impacts to our business.\nImpacts from these types of events are highly variable based on the severity and length of the event and scope of network impact. Climate-related changes such as higher temperatures, more intense and frequent rainfall and extreme storms can increase physical climate risk potentially compounding impacts to the business and operations. Such events have had and in the future could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. \nInsurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the Company's damages or damages to others, and may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Even with insurance, if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of services, the Company may not be able to restore services without a significant interruption in operations.\nAn escalating price on carbon emissions could materially increase direct costs related to fuel purchases and indirect expenses related to purchased goods, materials, and electricity required to operate our business.\n As a fuel-intensive operation, CP is exposed to both emerging and escalating carbon pricing regulations. CP is regulated under multiple carbon taxation systems and cap and trade market mechanisms in the Canadian provinces in which we operate. Approximately 75% of CP\u2019s Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions are generated through our operations in Canada and are impacted by carbon pricing mechanisms. \nIn most provinces, energy providers and utilities are directly regulated through carbon pricing programs. CP\u2019s carbon costs are generally assessed by our primary fuel suppliers based on fuel purchase transactions. The amount collected by our suppliers follows current regulatory carbon pricing rates multiplied by the total volume of fuel purchased. CP\u2019s carbon costs are also paid to a province as part of tax returns in some locations, based on reported locomotive fuel consumption in a specific region. CP is further exposed to carbon pricing through electricity purchases, where electric utilities pass on carbon costs to customers. Introduction of, or changes to, regulations by government bodies in response to climate change that increase the cost of carbon emissions could result in a significant increase in expenses and could adversely affect our business performance, results of operations, financial position and liquidity. \nA number of the sectors CP serves have the potential to be significantly impacted by climate-related transitional risks, including increased regulations, technology changes and shifts in consumer preferences. \nCP\u2019s business is based on transporting a wide variety of commodities from suppliers to the marketplace. CP regularly transports energy commodities that serve refineries, processing locations and end-users across North America and global markets. CP\u2019s business lines include thermal and metallurgical coal, crude oil and petroleum products, including liquefied petroleum gas, fuel oil, asphalt, gasoline, condensate (diluent) and lubricant oils.\nShifting consumer demand to lower-carbon products and increased climate-focused regulations, such as carbon pricing and fuel regulations, may instigate a broad transition in the energy sector. Programs that place a price on carbon emissions or other government restrictions on certain market sectors may further impact current and potential freight rail customers in the thermal coal, petroleum, crude oil and renewable fuel sectors. A comprehensive transition in the energy sector could significantly impact the markets of CP\u2019s energy customers or lead to market differentiation through geographic variation in policies and demand trends. A portion of CP\u2019s business could be materially affected by such a transition, including thermal coal, crude oil and petroleum products. Potential future changes and instability in these markets represent a significant transition risk to these business lines.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nGlobal Risks\nGlobal economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight transported by the Company.\n \nA decline or disruption in domestic, cross border or global economic conditions that affect the supply or demand for the commodities that CP transports may decrease CP\u2019s freight volumes and may result in a material adverse effect on CP\u2019s financial or operating results and liquidity. Economic conditions resulting in bankruptcies of one or more large customers could have a significant impact on CP's financial position, results of operations, and liquidity in a particular year or quarter.\n \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT\n \n \n30\nLiquidity Risks\nThe state of capital markets could adversely affect the Company's liquidity. \nWeakness in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the Company\u2019s access to capital. From time to time, the Company relies on the capital markets to provide some of its capital requirements, including the issuance of long-term debt instruments and commercial paper. Significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets and the credit markets, or deterioration of the Company's financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or eliminate the Company's access to, and/or significantly increase the cost of, various financing sources, including bank credit facilities and issuance of corporate bonds. Instability or disruptions of the capital markets and deterioration of the Company's financial condition, alone or in combination, could also result in a reduction in the Company's credit rating to below investment grade, which could also further prohibit or restrict the Company from accessing external sources of short-term and long-term debt financing, and/or significantly increase the associated costs.", "item7": ">ITEM 7. \nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nINDEX TO MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nPage\nExecutive Summary\n43\nPerformance Indicators\n44\nResults of Operations\n47\nImpact of Foreign Exchange on Earnings\n50\nImpact of Fuel Price on Earnings\n51\nImpact of Share Price on Earnings\n52\nOperating Revenues\n53\nOperating Expenses\n59\nOther Income Statement Items\n62\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n63\nShare Capital\n69\nNon-GAAP Measures\n69\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n79\nForward-Looking Statements\n83\n43 \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT  \n \nThe following Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d) is intended to enhance a reader\u2019s understanding of the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe update in RTM growth expectation was based on the impact of severe weather from the drought conditions on Canadian grain and the British Columbia (\"B.C.\") floods. The update in Adjusted diluted EPS expectation was also based on the impacts of the accelerated timeline of the Kansas City Southern (\"KCS\") acquisition closing into trust.   \n \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT\n \n \n44\nPerformance Indicators\nThe following table lists the key measures of the Company\u2019s operating performance:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n% Change\nFor the year ended December 31\n2021\n2020\n2019\n2021 vs. 2020\n2020 vs. 2019\nOperations Performance\nGross ton-miles (\u201cGTMs\u201d) (millions)\n271,921\n\u00a0\n272,360\u00a0\n280,724\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n(3)\nTrain miles (thousands)\n29,397\n\u00a0\n30,324\u00a0\n32,924\u00a0\n(3)\n(8)\nAverage train weight \u2013 excluding local traffic (tons)\n9,967\n\u00a0\n9,707\u00a0\n9,129\u00a0\n3\u00a0\n6\u00a0\nAverage train length \u2013 excluding local traffic (feet)\n8,200\n\u00a0\n7,929\u00a0\n7,388\u00a0\n3\u00a0\n7\u00a0\nAverage terminal dwell (hours)\n7.2\n\u00a0\n6.5\u00a0\n6.4\u00a0\n11\u00a0\n2\u00a0\nAverage train speed (miles per hour, or \"mph\")\n21.6\n\u00a0\n22.0\u00a0\n22.2\u00a0\n(2)\n(1)\nLocomotive productivity (GTMs / operating horsepower, or \"GTMs/OHP\")\n201\n\u00a0\n207\u00a0\n202\u00a0\n(3)\n2\u00a0\nFuel efficiency (U.S. gallons of locomotive fuel consumed /1,000 GTMs)\n0.931\n\u00a0\n0.942\u00a0\n0.955\u00a0\n(1)\n(1)\nTotal Employees and Workforce\nTotal employees (average)\n12,337\n\u00a0\n12,168\u00a0\n13,103\u00a0\n1\u00a0\n(7)\nTotal employees (end of period)\n11,834\n\u00a0\n11,890\u00a0\n12,694\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n(6)\nWorkforce (end of period)\n11,872\n\u00a0\n11,904\u00a0\n12,732\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n(7)\nSafety Indicators\nFRA personal injuries per 200,000 employee-hours\n0.92\n\u00a0\n1.11\u00a0\n1.42\u00a0\n(17)\n(22)\nFRA train accidents per million train-miles\n1.10\n\u00a0\n0.96\u00a0\n1.06\u00a0\n15\u00a0\n(9)\nOperations Performance\nThese key measures are used by management as comparisons to historical operating results and in the planning process to facilitate decisions that continue to drive further productivity improvements in the Company's operations. Results of these key measures reflect how effective CP\u2019s management is at controlling costs and executing the Company\u2019s operating plan and strategy. Continued monitoring of these key measures ensures that the Company can take appropriate actions to ensure the delivery of superior service and be able to grow its business at low incremental cost.\nA \nGTM\n is defined as the movement of one ton of train weight over one mile. GTMs are calculated by multiplying total train weight by the distance the train moved. Total train weight comprises the weight of the freight cars, their contents, and any inactive locomotives. An increase in GTMs indicates additional workload. GTMs for 2021 were 271,921 million, a slight decrease compared with 272,360 million in 2020. This decrease was mainly attributable to lower volumes of Grain and Potash. This decrease was partially offset by increased volumes of Metals, minerals and consumer products, Energy, chemicals and plastics, and Automotive. \nGTMs in 2020 were 272,360 million, a 3% decrease compared with 280,724 million in 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by decreased volumes of crude, Coal, and frac sand. This decrease was partially offset by increased volumes of Grain, Potash, and Fertilizers and sulphur. \nTrain miles\n are defined as the sum of the distance moved by all trains operated on the network. Train miles provide a measure of the productive utilization of our network. A smaller increase in train miles relative to increases in volumes, as measured by RTMs, and/or workload, as measured by GTMs, indicates improved train productivity. Train miles for 2021 were 29,397 thousands, a decrease of 3% compared with 30,324 thousands in 2020. This decrease reflects the impact of a slight decrease in workload (GTMs), as well as the impact of a 3% increase in average train weights. \nTrain miles in 2020 were 30,324, an decrease of 8% compared with 32,924 thousands in 2019. This decrease reflects the impact of a 3% decrease in workload (GTMs), as well as a 6% increase in average train weights. \nAverage train weight\n is defined as the average gross weight of CP trains, both loaded and empty. This excludes trains in short-haul service, work trains used to move CP\u2019s track equipment and materials, and the haulage of other railways\u2019 trains on CP\u2019s network. An increase in average train weight indicates improved asset utilization and may also be the result of moving heavier commodities. Average train weight of 9,967 tons in 2021 increased by 260 tons, or 3% compared with 9,707 tons in 2020. This increase was a result of improvements in operating plan efficiency and continued improvements \n45 \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT  \n \nin bulk train efficiency due to moving longer and heavier Grain and export potash trains. This increase was partially offset by lower volumes of heavier bulk commodities. Improvements for Grain trains were driven by the High Efficiency Product (\"HEP\") train model, which is an 8,500-foot train model that features the new high-capacity grain hopper cars and increased grain carrying capacity.\nAverage train weight of 9,707 tons in 2020 increased by 578 tons, or 6% compared with 9,129 tons in 2019. This increase was a result of improvements in operating plan efficiency, continued improvements in operational efficiency due to moving longer and heavier export potash and Grain trains, and improved winter operating conditions in the first quarter of 2020. This increase was partially offset by moving lower volumes of heavier commodities such as Canadian coal and crude. Improvements for Grain trains were driven by the 8,500-foot HEP train model.\nAverage train length\n is defined as the average total length of CP trains, both loaded and empty. This includes all cars and locomotives on the train and is calculated as the sum of each car or locomotive's length multiplied by the distance travelled, divided by train miles. This excludes trains in short-haul service, work trains used to move CP's track equipment and materials, and the haulage of other railroads' trains on CP's network. An increase in average train length indicates improved asset utilization. Average train length of 8,200 feet in 2021 increased by 271 feet, or 3%, compared with 7,929 feet in 2020. This increase was a result of improvements in operating plan efficiency and continued improvements in bulk train efficiency due to moving longer Grain and export potash trains. Improvements for Grain trains were driven by the 8,500-foot HEP train model.\nAverage train length of 7,929 feet in 2020 increased by 541 feet, or 7%, compared with 7,388 feet in 2019. This increase was a result of improvements in operating plan efficiency and continued improvements in operational efficiency due to moving longer Grain and export potash trains. This increase was partially offset by moving lower volumes of commodities such as Canadian coal, which move in longer trains. Improvements for Grain trains were driven by the 8,500-foot HEP train model.\nAverage terminal dwell\n is defined as the average time a freight car resides within terminal boundaries expressed in hours. The timing starts with a train arriving at the terminal, a customer releasing the car to the Company, or a car arriving at interchange from another railroad. The timing ends when the train leaves, a customer receives the car from CP, or the freight car is transferred to another railroad. Freight cars are excluded if they are being stored at the terminal or used in track repairs. A decrease in average terminal dwell indicates improved terminal performance resulting in faster cycle times and improved railcar utilization. Average terminal dwell of 7.2 hours in 2021 increased by 11% from 6.5 hours in 2020. This unfavourable increase was a result of aligning the operating plan to demand in order to maintain network efficiencies, as well as the impacts of the B.C. wildfires in the third quarter and B.C. floods in the fourth quarter of 2021. Aligning the operating plan to demand resulted in increased average train weight and average train length. \nAverage terminal dwell of 6.5 hours in 2020 increased by 2% from 6.4 hours in 2019. This unfavourable increase was a result of aligning the operating plan to demand in order to maintain network efficiencies in the last three quarters of 2020. Aligning the operating plan to demand resulted in increased average train weight, average train length, and increased locomotive productivity. \nAverage train speed\n is defined as a measure of the line-haul movement from origin to destination including terminal dwell hours. It is calculated by dividing the total train miles travelled by the total train hours operated. This calculation does not include delay time related to customers or foreign railways and excludes the time and distance travelled by: i) trains used in or around CP\u2019s yards; ii) passenger trains; and iii) trains used for repairing track. An increase in average train speed indicates improved on-time performance resulting in improved asset utilization. Average train speed was 21.6 mph in 2021, a decrease of 2%, from 22.0 mph in 2020. This decrease in speed was driven primarily by harsh winter operating conditions in the first quarter of 2021 as well as the impact of the B.C. wildfires in the third quarter of 2021.\nAverage train speed in 2020 was 22.0 mph, a decrease of 1%, from 22.2 mph in 2019. This decrease in speed was a result of aligning the operating plan to demand in order to maintain network efficiencies in the last three quarters of 2020, partially offset by improved winter operating conditions in the first quarter of 2020. Aligning the operating plan to demand resulted in increased average train weight, average train length, and increased locomotive productivity.\nLocomotive productivity\n is defined as the daily average GTMs divided by daily average operating horsepower. Operating horsepower excludes units offline, tied up or in storage, or in use on other railways, and includes foreign units online. An increase in locomotive productivity indicates more efficient locomotive utilization and may also be the result of moving heavier commodities. Locomotive productivity was 201 GTMs/OHP in 2021, a decrease of 6 GTMs/OHP, or 3%, compared to 207 GTMs/OHP in 2020. This decrease was primarily due to moving higher volumes of merchandise, which are lighter than bulk commodities, as well the impacts of the B.C. floods in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nLocomotive productivity was 207 GTMs/OHP in 2020, an increase of 5 GTMs/OHP, or 2%, compared to 202 GTMs/OHP in 2019. This increase was primarily due to improvements in operating plan efficiency as a result of aligning the operating plan to demand.\nFuel efficiency\n \nis defined as U.S. gallons of locomotive fuel consumed per 1,000 GTMs.\n \nFuel consumed includes gallons from freight, yard and commuter service but excludes fuel used in capital projects and other non-freight activities. An improvement in fuel efficiency indicates operational cost savings and CP's commitment to corporate sustainability through a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions intensity. Fuel efficiency for 2021 was 0.931 U.S. gallons/1,000 GTMs, an improvement of 1% compared to 0.942 U.S. gallons/1,000 GTMs in 2020. This improvement was due to running longer and \n \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT\n \n \n46\nheavier trains as a result of improvements in the operating plan. Fuel efficiency for 2020 was 0.942 U.S. gallons/1,000 GTMs, an improvement of 1% compared to 0.955 U.S. gallons/1,000 GTMs in 2019. This improvement was primarily due to improved winter operating conditions in the first quarter of 2020.\nTotal Employees and Workforce\nAn \nemployee\n is defined as an individual currently engaged in full-time, part-time, or seasonal employment with CP while \nworkforce\n is defined as total employees plus contractors and consultants. The Company monitors employment and workforce levels in order to efficiently meet service and strategic requirements. The number of employees is a key driver to total compensation and benefits costs.\nThe average number of total employees for 2021 was 12,337, an increase of 169, or 1%, compared to 12,168 in 2020. This increase was driven by the return to work of employees furloughed in the prior year as a result of the economic downturn caused by COVID-19. The total number of employees as at December 31, 2021 was 11,834, a decrease of 56 compared to 11,890 as at December 31, 2020.\nThe average number of total employees for 2020 was 12,168, a decrease of 935, or 7%, compared to 13,103 in 2019. This decrease was primarily due to more efficient resource planning, including furloughs associated with the economic downturn caused by COVID-19, partially offset by the addition of Central Maine & Quebec Railway U.S. Inc. employees. The total number of employees as at December 31, 2020 was 11,890, a decrease of 804, or 6%, compared to 12,694 as at December 31, 2019, due to reduced workload as measured in GTMs and more efficient resource planning.\nThe total workforce as at December\u00a031, 2021 was 11,872, a decrease of 32, compared to 11,904 as at December\u00a031, 2020.\nThe total workforce as at December 31, 2020 was 11,904, a decrease of 828, or 7%, compared to 12,732 as at December 31, 2019, due to more efficient resource planning.\nSafety Indicators\nSafety is a key priority and core strategy for CP\u2019s management, employees, and Board of Directors. Personal injuries and train accidents are indicators of the effectiveness of the Company's safety systems, and are used by management to evaluate and, as necessary, alter the Company's safety systems, procedures, and protocols. Each measure follows U.S Federal Railroad Administration (\"FRA\") reporting guidelines, which can result in restatement after initial publication to reflect new information available within specified periods stipulated by the FRA but that exceed the Company's financial reporting timeline.\nThe \nFRA personal injuries per 200,000 employee-hours \nfrequency is the number of personal injuries, multiplied by 200,000 and divided by total employee hours. Personal injuries are defined as injuries that require employees to lose time away from work, modify their normal duties or obtain medical treatment beyond minor first aid. FRA employee-hours are the total hours worked, excluding vacation and sick time, by all employees, excluding contractors.\u00a0The FRA personal injuries per 200,000 employee-hours frequency for CP was 0.92 in 2021, compared with 1.11 in 2020 and 1.42 in 2019.\nThe\n \nFRA train accidents per million train-miles \nfrequency is the number of train accidents, multiplied by 1,000,000 and divided by total train miles. Train accidents included in this metric meet or exceed the FRA reporting threshold of U.S. $11,200 in damage in 2021 and U.S. $10,700 in damage for 2020 and 2019. The FRA train accidents per million train-miles frequency for CP was 1.10 in 2021 , compared with 0.96 in 2020 and 1.06 in 2019.\n47 \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT  \n \nResults of Operations\nIncome\n \n* Adjusted operating income is defined and reconciled in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOperating income was $3,206 million in 2021, a decrease of $105 million, or 3%, from $3,311 million in 2020.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, was $3,389 million in 2021, an increase of $78 million, or 2%, from $3,311 million in 2020. This increase was primarily due to:\n\u2022\nhigher freight rates;\n\u2022\na gain on the exchange of property and construction easements in Chicago of $50 million and higher gains on land sales primarily in B.C. of $29 million;\n\u2022\nlower stock-based compensation of $39\u00a0million primarily driven by the impact of changes in share price; and\n\u2022\nthe efficiencies generated from improved operating performance and asset utilization.\nThis increase was partially offset by:\n\u2022\nlower volumes as measured by RTMs;\n\u2022\nthe unfavourable impact of the change in FX of $117 million;\n\u2022\na gain of $68\u00a0million recognized in 2020 as a result of the remeasurement to fair value of the previously held equity investment in DRTP;\n\u2022\nhigher depreciation and amortization of $46 million (excluding FX); \n\u2022\ncost inflation; and\n\u2022\nhigher DB pension and post-retirement benefits current service cost of $32 million. \n \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT\n \n \n48\nOperating income was $3,311 million in 2020, an increase of $187 million, or 6%, from $3,124 million in 2019. This increase was primarily due to:\n\u2022\nliquidated damages, including customer volume commitments, and higher freight rates;\n\u2022\nthe efficiencies generated from improved operating performance and asset utilization;\n\u2022\na gain of $68\u00a0million as a result of the remeasurement to fair value of the previously held equity investment in DRTP; \n\u2022\nthe impact of harsher winter operating conditions in 2019; and\n\u2022\ndecreased operating expense associated with lower casualty costs incurred in 2020.\nThis increase was partially offset by:\n\u2022\nlower volumes as measured by RTMs; \n\u2022\nhigher depreciation and amortization of $71\u00a0million (excluding FX); \n\u2022\ncost inflation; and\n\u2022\nhigher stock-based compensation of $37\u00a0million primarily driven by an increase in stock price. \nThere were no adjustments to operating income in 2020 and 2019. \nOperating Ratio\n*Adjusted operating ratio is defined and reconciled in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe Operating ratio provides the percentage of revenues used to operate the railway. A lower percentage normally indicates higher efficiency in the operation of the railway. The Company\u2019s Operating ratio was 59.9% in 2021, a 280 basis point increase from 57.1% in 2020. This increase was primarily due to:\n\u2022\nacquisition-related costs associated with the KCS acquisition that were recognized in Purchased services and other;\n\u2022\nthe unfavourable impact of changes in fuel prices, net of recoveries; \n\u2022\nlower volumes as measured by RTMs; \n\u2022\na gain recognized in 2020 as a result of the remeasurement to fair value of the previously held equity investment in DRTP;  \n\u2022\nhigher depreciation and amortization (excluding FX); and\n\u2022\ncost inflation.\nThis increase was partially offset by higher freight rates and a gain on the exchange of property and construction easements in Chicago and higher gains on land sales primarily in B.C. \nAdjusted operating ratio was 57.6% in 2021, a 50 basis point increase from 57.1% in 2020. This increase reflects the same factors discussed above for the increase in Operating ratio, except that Adjusted operating ratio in 2021 excludes the acquisition-related costs associated with the KCS acquisition \nthat were recognized in Purchased services and other\n.\nThe Company\u2019s Operating ratio was 57.1% in 2020, a 280 basis point improvement from 59.9% in 2019. This improvement was primarily due to: \n\u2022\nliquidated damages, including customer volume commitments, and higher freight rates;\n\u2022\nthe favourable impact of changes in fuel prices;\n\u2022\nthe efficiencies generated from improved operating performance and asset utilization; and\n\u2022\na gain as a result of the remeasurement to fair value of the previously held equity investment in DRTP.\n49 \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT  \n \nThis improvement was partially offset by:\n\u2022\nhigher depreciation and amortization;\n\u2022\ncost inflation; and \n\u2022\nhigher stock-based compensation.\nThere were no adjustments to the operating ratio in 2020 and 2019.\nNet Income \n*Adjusted income is defined and reconciled in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nNet \nincome was $2,852 million in 2021, an increase of $408 million, or 17%, from $2,444 million in 2020. This increase was primarily due to the $845 million merger termination payment received in connection with KCS's termination of the Original Merger Agreement and \nhigher freight rates.\nThis increase was partially offset by:\n\u2022\nacquisition-related costs of $599\u00a0million associated with the KCS acquisition including $169 million costs incurred by KCS recognized in Equity loss of KCS;\n\u2022\nlower volumes as measured by RTMs; and\n\u2022\nthe unfavourable impact of the change in FX of $90 million.\nNet income was $2,444 million in 2020, an increase of $4 million, from $2,440 million in 2019. This increase was primarily due to:\n\u2022\nhigher Operating income;\n\u2022\na deferred tax recovery relating to a tax return filing election for the state of North Dakota; and\n\u2022\na provision for an uncertain tax item of a prior period in 2019. \nThis increase was partially offset by:\n\u2022\nan income tax recovery associated with changes in tax rates in 2019;\n\u2022\nlower FX translation gain on U.S. dollar-denominated debt and lease liabilities compared to 2019; and\n\u2022\nlower other components of net periodic benefit recovery.\nAdjusted income, defined and reconciled in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, was $2,565 million in 2021, an increase of $162 million, or 7%, from $2,403 million in 2020. This increase was primarily due to higher\nAdjusted operating income and higher other components of net periodic benefit recovery.\nAdjusted income was $2,403 million in 2020, an increase of $113 million, or 5%, from $2,290 million in 2019. This increase was primarily due to higher Operating income, partially offset by lower other components of net periodic benefit recovery.\n \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT\n \n \n50\nDiluted Earnings per Share \n*Adjusted diluted EPS is defined and reconciled in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nDiluted EPS was $4.18 in 2021, an increase of $0.59, or 16%, from $3.59 in 2020. This increase was due to a higher Net income.\nDiluted EPS was $3.59 in 2020, an increase of $0.09, or 3%, from $3.50 in 2019. This increase was due to a lower average number of outstanding Common Shares due to the Company's share repurchase program, and higher Net income.\nAdjusted diluted EPS, defined and reconciled in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, was $3.76 in 2021, an increase of $0.23, or 7%, from $3.53 in 2020. This increase was due to higher Adjusted income.\nAdjusted diluted EPS was $3.53 in 2020, an increase of $0.24, or 7%, from $3.29 in 2019. This increase was due to higher Adjusted income and lower average number of outstanding Common Shares due to the Company's share repurchase program. \nReturn on Average Shareholders' Equity and Adjusted Return on Invested Capital \nReturn on average shareholders' equity and Adjusted return on invested capital (\"Adjusted ROIC\") are measures used by management to determine how productively the Company uses its long-term capital investments, representing critical indicators of good operating and investment decisions. Adjusted ROIC is also an important performance criteria in determining certain elements of the Company's long-term incentive plan.  \nReturn on average shareholders' equity was 13.9% in 2021, a 2,010 basis point decrease compared to 34.0% in 2020. This decrease was due to higher average shareholders' equity driven by shares issued for the KCS acquisition and accumulated Net income, partially offset by higher Net income.\nReturn on average shareholders' equity was 34.0% in 2020, a 160 basis point decrease compared to 35.6% in 2019. This decrease was due to higher average shareholders' equity due to accumulated Net income, partially offset by the impact of the Company's share repurchase program.\nAdjusted ROIC was 8.2% in 2021, an 850 basis point decrease compared to 16.7% in 2020. This decrease was primarily due to higher average long-term debt and shares issued for the KCS acquisition and accumulated Adjusted income. \nAdjusted ROIC was 16.7% in 2020, a 20 basis point decrease compared to 16.9% in 2019. This decrease was primarily due to higher average long-term debt, partially offset by higher Operating income. \nAdjusted ROIC is a Non-GAAP measure, which is defined and reconciled from Return on average shareholders' equity, the most comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nImpact of Foreign Exchange on Earnings\nFluctuations in FX affect the Company\u2019s results because U.S. dollar-denominated revenues and expenses are translated into Canadian dollars. U.S. dollar-denominated revenues and expenses increase (decrease) when the Canadian dollar weakens (strengthens) in relation to the U.S. dollar. \n51 \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT  \n \nOn February 18, 2022, the noon buying rate certified for customs purposes by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of New York was U.S. $1.00 = $1.27 Canadian dollars.\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the average\u00a0exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar expressed in the Canadian dollar equivalent of one U.S. dollar, the period end exchange rates, and the high and low exchange rates for the periods indicated. Average exchange rates are calculated by using the exchange rates on the last day of each full month during the relevant period.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, Foreign Exchange Risk.\nImpact of Fuel Price on Earnings\nFluctuations in fuel prices affect the Company\u2019s results because fuel expense constitutes a significant portion of CP's operating costs. As fuel prices fluctuate, there will be a timing impact on earnings, as discussed further in Item 1. Business, Operations, Fuel Cost Adjustment Program and Item 1A.

Higher fuel prices resulted in an increase in Total operating expenses of $243 million. Higher fuel prices and increased carbon tax recoveries, partially offset by the timing of recoveries from CP's fuel cost adjustment program, resulted in an increase in Total revenues of $236 million from 2020. In 2020, the impact of lower fuel prices resulted in a decrease in Total revenues of $170 million and a decrease in Total operating expenses of $195 million.\n \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT\n \n \n52\nImpact of Share Price on Earnings\nFluctuations in the Common Share price affect the Company's operating expenses because share-based liabilities are measured at fair value. The Company's Common Shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\") and the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") with ticker symbol \"CP\". As a result of the five-for-one share split of the Company's issued and outstanding Common Shares, which began trading on a post-split basis on May 14, 2021, per share amounts and all outstanding Common Shares for periods prior to Q2 2021 have been retrospectively adjusted.

Fuel surcharge revenues include recoveries of carbon taxes, levies, and obligations under cap-and-trade programs.\n(2) \nFX adjusted % change does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, is unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. FX adjusted % change is defined and reconciled in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe Company\u2019s revenues are primarily derived from transporting freight. Changes in freight volumes generally contribute to corresponding changes in freight revenues and certain variable expenses, such as fuel, crew costs, and equipment rents. Non-freight revenue is generated from leasing of certain assets; other arrangements, including contracts with passenger service operators and logistical services; and switching fees. \nFreight Revenues\nFreight revenues were $7,816 million in 2021, an increase of $275 million, or 4%, from $7,541 million in 2020. This increase was primarily due to increased freight revenue per RTM. This increase was partially offset by lower volumes as measured by RTMs.\nFreight revenues were $7,541 million in 2020, a decrease of $72 million, or 1%, from $7,613 million in 2019. This decrease was primarily due to lower volumes as measured by RTMs. This decrease was partially offset by higher freight revenue per RTM.\nRTMs\nRTMs are defined as the movement of one revenue-producing ton of freight over a distance of one mile. RTMs measure the relative weight and distance of rail freight moved by the Company. RTMs for 2021 were 149,686 million, a decrease of 2,205 million, or 1%, compared with 151,891 million in 2020. This decrease was mainly attributable to lower volumes of Grain and Potash. This decrease was partially offset by higher volumes of Metals, minerals and consumer products, Energy, chemicals and plastics, and Automotive.\nRTMs for 2020 were 151,891 million, a decrease of 2,487 million, or 2%, compared with 154,378 million in 2019. This decrease was mainly attributable to lower volumes of crude, Coal and frac sand. This decrease was partially offset by higher volumes of Grain, Potash, and Fertilizers and sulphur.  \nFreight revenue per RTM\nFreight revenue per RTM is defined as freight revenue per revenue-producing ton of freight over a distance of one mile. This is an indicator of yield. Freight revenue per RTM was 5.22 cents in 2021, an increase of 0.26 cents, or 5%, from 4.96 cents in 2020. This increase was primarily due to higher fuel surcharge revenue as a result of higher fuel prices of $236 million, higher freight rates, and moving higher volumes of Automotive, which has a higher freight revenue per RTM compared to the corporate average. This increase was partially offset by the unfavourable impact of the change in FX of $226 million.\nFreight revenue per RTM was 4.96 cents in 2020, an increase of 0.03 cents, or 1%, from 4.93 cents in 2019. This increase was primarily due to higher liquidated damages, including customer volume commitments, higher freight rates, and the favourable impact of the change in FX of $33 million. This increase was partially offset by the unfavourable impact of lower fuel surcharge revenue as a result of lower fuel prices of $170 million and moving lower volumes of Automotive, which has a higher freight revenue per RTM compared to the corporate average.\nCarloads\nCarloads are defined as revenue-generating shipments of containers and freight cars. Carloads were 2,735.5 thousand in 2021, an increase of 27.1 thousand, or 1%, from 2,708.4 thousand in 2020. This increase was primarily due to higher volumes of Coal, Metals, minerals and consumer products, Intermodal, and Energy, chemicals and plastics. This increase was partially offset by lower volumes of Grain and Potash.\n \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT\n \n \n54\nCarloads were 2,708.4 thousand in 2020, a decrease of 58.0 thousand, or 2%, from 2,766.4 thousand in 2019. This decrease was primarily due to lower volumes of crude, Coal, and frac sand. This decrease was partially offset by higher volumes of Grain and Potash.\nFreight revenue per carload\nFreight revenue per carload is defined as freight revenue per revenue-generating shipment of containers or freight cars. This is an indicator of yield. Freight revenue per carload was $2,857 in 2021, an increase of $73, or 3%, from $2,784 in 2020. This increase was primarily due to higher fuel surcharge revenue as a result of higher fuel prices of $236 million and higher freight rates. This increase was partially offset by the unfavourable impact of the change in FX of $226 million.\nFreight revenue per carload was $2,784 in 2020, an increase of $32, or 1%, from $2,752 in 2019. This increase was primarily due to higher liquidated damages, including customer volume commitments, higher freight rates, and the favourable impact of the change in FX of $33 million. This increase was partially offset by the unfavourable impact of lower fuel surcharge revenue as a result of lower fuel prices of $170 million.\nNon-freight Revenues\nNon-freight revenues were $179 million in 2021, an increase of $10 million, or 6%, from $169 million in 2020. This increase was primarily due to revenue recognized for construction easements in Chicago of $13 million, higher leasing revenues, and higher revenue from passenger service operators, partially offset by lower revenue from logistical services and switching fees. \nNon-freight revenues were $169 million in 2020, a decrease of $10 million, or 6%, from $179 million in 2019.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nGrain revenue was $1,684 million in 2021, a decrease of $145 million, or 8%, from $1,829 million in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to lower volumes of Canadian grain to Vancouver and eastern Canada primarily as a result of drought conditions and the unfavourable impact of the change in FX. This decrease was partially offset by higher volumes of U.S. corn to western Canada and the U.S. Pacific Northwest and increased freight revenue per RTM. Freight revenue per RTM increased due to higher freight rates and higher fuel surcharge revenue as a result of higher fuel prices. Carloads decreased more than RTMs due to moving higher volumes of U.S. corn to western Canada and the U.S. Pacific Northwest, which have longer lengths of haul.\nGrain revenue was $1,829 million in 2020, an increase of $145 million, or 9%, from $1,684 million in 2019. This increase was primarily due to moving record volumes of Canadian grain, primarily to Vancouver and Thunder Bay, higher volumes of U.S. soybeans and corn to the U.S. Pacific Northwest, higher freight rates, and the favourable impact of the change in FX. This increase was partially offset by decreased freight revenue per RTM. Freight revenue per RTM decreased due to moving proportionately higher volumes of long haul soybeans and corn to the U.S. Pacific Northwest, which also caused RTMs to increase more than carloads, and lower fuel surcharge revenue as a result of lower fuel prices.\n55 \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT  \n \nCoal\n2021 vs. 2020\n2020 vs. 2019\nFor the year ended December 31\n2021\n2020\n2019\nTotal Change\n% Change\nFX Adjusted % Change\n(1)\nTotal Change\n% Change\nFX Adjusted % Change\n(1)\nFreight revenues (in millions)\n$\n625\n\u00a0\n$\n566\u00a0\n$\n682\u00a0\n$\n59\u00a0\n10\u00a0\n11\u00a0\n$\n(116)\n(17)\n(17)\nCarloads (in thousands)\n291.5\n\u00a0\n260.4\u00a0\n304.3\u00a0\n31.1\u00a0\n12\u00a0\nN/A\n(43.9)\n(14)\nN/A\nRevenue ton-miles (in millions)\n18,345\n\u00a0\n18,510\u00a0\n21,820\u00a0\n(165)\n(1)\nN/A\n(3,310)\n(15)\nN/A\nFreight revenue per carload (in dollars)\n$\n2,144\n\u00a0\n$\n2,174\u00a0\n$\n2,241\u00a0\n$\n(30)\n(1)\n(1)\n$\n(67)\n(3)\n(3)\nFreight revenue per revenue ton-mile (in cents)\n3.41\n\u00a0\n3.06\u00a0\n3.13\u00a0\n0.35\u00a0\n11\u00a0\n12\u00a0\n(0.07)\n(2)\n(2)\n(1) \nFX adjusted % change does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, is unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nCoal revenue was $625 million in 2021, an increase of $59 million, or 10%, from $566 million in 2020. This increase was primarily due to increased freight revenue per RTM, higher volumes of Canadian coal to Kamloops, B.C., and higher volumes of U.S. coal to the U.S. Midwest. This increase was partially offset by lower volumes of Canadian coal to Vancouver and the unfavourable impact of the change in FX. Freight revenue per RTM increased due to higher fuel surcharge revenue as a result of higher fuel prices. RTMs decreased while carloads increased due to moving lower volumes of Canadian coal to Vancouver, which has a longer length of haul, and moving higher volumes of Canadian coal to Kamloops, B.C., which has a shorter length of haul.\nCoal revenue was $566 million in 2020, a decrease of $116 million, or 17%, from $682 million in 2019. This decrease was primarily due to lower volumes of Canadian coal primarily to Vancouver, driven by supply chain challenges at both the mines and the ports, lower volumes of U.S. coal to Wisconsin, and decreased freight revenue per RTM.

This decrease was primarily due to lower volumes of export potash to Vancouver and the U.S. Pacific Northwest as a result of construction at the Port of Vancouver and the Port of Portland, lower volumes of domestic potash, and the unfavourable impact of the change in FX. This decrease was partially offset by increased freight revenue per RTM due to higher fuel surcharge revenue as a result of higher fuel prices and higher freight rates. RTMs decreased more than carloads due to moving lower volumes of export potash, which has a longer length of haul. \nPotash revenue was $493 million in 2020, an increase of $31 million, or 7%, from $462 million in 2019.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIntermodal revenue was $1,724 million in 2021, an increase of $161 million, or 10%, from $1,563 million in 2020. This increase was primarily due to increased freight revenue per RTM, onboarding new international intermodal customers, and higher domestic retail and wholesale intermodal volumes. This increase was partially offset by the completion of an international intermodal customer contract and the unfavourable impact of the change in FX. Freight revenue per RTM increased due to higher fuel surcharge revenue as a result of higher fuel prices and higher freight rates. Carloads increased while RTMs decreased due to moving lower volumes of international intermodal to and from the Port of Vancouver, which has a longer length of haul.\nIntermodal revenue was $1,563 million in 2020, a decrease of $30 million, or 2%, from $1,593 million in 2019. This decrease was primarily due to decreased freight revenue per RTM and lower volumes of international intermodal driven by the completion of a customer contract. This decrease was partially offset by the onboarding of a new international intermodal customer, higher freight rates, and the favourable impact of the change in FX.

Compensation and benefits expense was $1,570 million in 2021, an increase of $10 million, or 1%, from $1,560 million in 2020. This increase was primarily due to:\n\u2022\nthe impact of wage and benefit inflation;\n\u2022\nhigher DB pension and post-retirement benefits current service cost of $32 million; and\n\u2022\nincreased training costs driven by recovery from the economic downturn caused by COVID-19 in the prior year.\nThis increase was partially offset by:\n\u2022\nlower stock-based compensation of $39\u00a0million primarily driven by the impact of changes in share price;\n\u2022\nthe favourable impact of the change in FX of $27 million; and\n\u2022\nprior year bonus paid to frontline employees of $17\u00a0million.\nCompensation and benefits expense was $1,560 million in 2020, an increase of $20 million, or 1% from $1,540 million in 2019.

Fuel expense was $854 million in 2021, an increase of $202 million, or 31%, from $652 million in 2020. This increase was primarily due to the unfavourable impact of higher fuel prices of $243 million. \nThis increase was partially offset by:\n\u2022\nthe favourable impact of the change in FX of $29 million;\n\u2022\nan increase in fuel efficiency of 1% from improvements in the operating plan resulting in running longer and heavier trains; and\n\u2022\na decrease in workload, as measured by GTMs. \nFuel expense was $652 million in 2020, a decrease of $230 million, or 26%, from $882 million in 2019. This decrease was primarily due to:\n\u2022\nthe favourable impact of lower fuel prices of $195\u00a0million;\n\u2022\na decrease in workload, as measured by GTMs; and\n\u2022\nan improvement in fuel efficiency of 1% from improved winter operating conditions in the first quarter of 2020. \nThis decrease was partially offset by the unfavourable impact of the change in FX of $8 million.\n61 \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT  \n \nMaterials\nMaterials expense includes the cost of material used for maintenance of track, locomotives, freight cars, and buildings as well as software sustainment. Materials expense was $215 million in 2021, a decrease of $1 million, from $216 million in 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the favorable impact of the change in FX of $3 million and a decrease in freight car maintenance, partially offset by an increase in fuel costs.\nMaterials expense was $216 million in 2020, an increase of $6 million, or 3%, from $210 million in 2019. This increase was primarily due to higher spending on locomotive maintenance and overhauls, and track maintenance.\nEquipment Rents\nEquipment rents expense includes the cost associated with using other companies\u2019 freight cars, intermodal equipment, and locomotives, net of rental income received from other railways for the use of CP\u2019s equipment. Equipment rents expense was $121 million in 2021, a decrease of $21 million, or 15%, from $142 million in 2020. This decrease was primarily due to:\n\u2022\nhigher receipts for CP freight cars used by other railways;\n\u2022\nprice incentives received on intermodal cars; and\n\u2022\nthe favourable impact of the change in FX of $8 million.\nThis decrease was partially offset by greater usage of pooled freight cars.\nEquipment rents expense was $142 million in 2020, an increase of $5 million, or 4%, from $137 million in 2019. This increase was primarily due to lower receipts for CP freight cars used by other railways and the unfavourable impact of the change in FX of $2 million, partially offset by lower usage of pooled freight cars as a result of lower volumes.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense represents the charge associated with the use of track and roadway, buildings, rolling stock, information systems, and other depreciable assets. Depreciation and amortization expense was $811 million for 2021, an increase of $32 million, or 4%, from $779 million in 2020. This increase was primarily due to a higher asset base, as a result of the capital program spending in 2021 and recent years, and the impact of depreciation studies. This was partially offset by the favourable impact of the change in FX of $14 million.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $779 million for 2020, an increase of $73 million, or 10%, from $706 million in 2019. This increase was primarily due to:\n\u2022\na higher asset base, as a result of the capital program spending in 2020; \n\u2022\nthe impact of depreciation studies and other adjustments made in 2019; and\n\u2022\nthe unfavourable impact of the change in FX of $2 million.\nPurchased Services and Other\n2021 vs. 2020\n2020 vs. 2019\nFor the year ended December 31 \n(in millions of Canadian dollars)\n2021\n2020\n2019\nTotal Change\n% Change\nTotal Change\n% Change\nSupport and facilities\n$\n293\n\u00a0\n$\n271\u00a0\n$\n278\u00a0\n$\n22\u00a0\n8\u00a0\n$\n(7)\n(3)\nTrack and operations\n260\n\u00a0\n282\u00a0\n278\u00a0\n(22)\n(8)\n4\u00a0\n1\u00a0\nIntermodal\n205\n\u00a0\n209\u00a0\n222\u00a0\n(4)\n(2)\n(13)\n(6)\nEquipment\n105\n\u00a0\n113\u00a0\n125\u00a0\n(8)\n(7)\n(12)\n(10)\nCasualty\n125\n\u00a0\n116\u00a0\n149\u00a0\n9\u00a0\n8\u00a0\n(33)\n(22)\nProperty taxes\n128\n\u00a0\n126\u00a0\n133\u00a0\n2\u00a0\n2\u00a0\n(7)\n(5)\nOther\n191\n\u00a0\n(57)\n29\u00a0\n248\u00a0\n(435)\n(86)\n(297)\nLand sales\n(89)\n(10)\n(21)\n(79)\n790\u00a0\n11\u00a0\n(52)\nTotal Purchased services and other\n$\n1,218\n\u00a0\n$\n1,050\u00a0\n$\n1,193\u00a0\n$\n168\u00a0\n16\u00a0\n$\n(143)\n(12)\nPurchased services and other expense encompasses a wide range of third-party costs, including contractor and consulting fees, locomotive and freight car repairs performed by third parties, property and other taxes, intermodal pickup and delivery services, casualty expense, expenses for joint facilities, and gains on land sales. Purchased services and other expense was $1,218 million in 2021, an increase of $168 million, or 16%, from $1,050 million in 2020.

In 2021, the Company recognized a $141 million equity loss from the date of acquisition of KCS closing into the voting trust to December 31, 2021 in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The equity loss was attributable to the acquisition-related costs incurred during this period. No similar equity loss existed in the same period of 2020.\nOther Expense (Income) \nOther expense (income)\n \nconsists of gains and losses from the change in FX on debt and lease liabilities and working capital, costs related to financing, shareholder costs, equity income, and other non-operating expenditures. Other expense was $237 million in 2021, a change of $244 million, or 3,486%, from income of $7 million in 2020. \nThis change was primarily due to acquisition-related costs of $247\u00a0million which include losses on interest rate hedges of $264 million and bridge facility and backstop revolver fees of $52 million, partially offset by gains on cash held for the KCS acquisition of $56 million and gains on FX hedges of $13 million\n.\nOther income was $7 million in 2020, a decrease of $82 million, or 92%, from $89 million in the same period of 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a lower FX translation gain on U.S. dollar-denominated debt and lease liabilities of $80 million.\nFX translation gains and losses on debt and lease liabilities and acquisition-related costs are discussed further in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nMerger Termination Fee\nOn May 21, 2021, KCS terminated the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Original Merger Agreement\") with CP to enter into a definitive agreement with Canadian National Railway. At the same time and in accordance with the terms of the Original Merger Agreement, KCS paid CP a termination fee of $845\u00a0million (U.S. $700\u00a0million). This amount is reported as \"Merger termination fee\" in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income in 2021. No similar items were received in the same period of 2020.\nOther Components of Net Periodic Benefit Recovery\nOther components of net periodic benefit recovery is related to the Company's pension and other post-retirement and post-employment benefit plans. It includes interest cost on benefit obligations, expected return on fund assets, recognized net actuarial losses, and amortization of prior service costs. Other components of net periodic benefit recovery were $387 million in 2021, an increase of $45 million, or 13%, from $342 million in 2020. This increase was primarily due to a decrease in the interest cost on the benefit obligation of $56 million and an increase in expected return on fund assets of $14 million, partially offset by an increase in recognized net actuarial losses of $24 million.\n63 \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT  \n \nOther components of net periodic benefit recovery were $342 million in 2020, a decrease of $39 million or 10%, from $381 million in 2019. This decrease was primarily due to an increase in recognized net actuarial losses of $85 million and a decrease in expected return on fund assets of $2 million, partially offset by a decrease in the interest cost on the benefit obligation of $47 million. \nNet Interest Expense\nNet interest expense includes interest on long-term debt and finance leases. Net interest expense was $440 million in 2021, a decrease of $18 million, or 4%, from $458 million in 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a change in FX of $27 million and a reduction of interest on long-term debt of $15 million as the result of a lower effective interest rate, partially offset by an increase in interest on long-term debt from debt issuances related to the KCS acquisition in the last quarter of 2021.\nNet interest expense was $458 million in 2020, an increase of $10 million, or 2%, from $448 million in 2019. This increase was primarily due to the unfavourable impacts of an increase in debt levels of $34\u00a0million and the change in FX of $4 million. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in interest related to long-term debt of $29\u00a0million as the result of a lower effective interest rate following the Company's debt refinancing completed in 2019 and 2020.\nIncome Tax Expense \nIncome tax expense was $768 million in 2021, an increase of $10 million, or 1%, from $758 million in 2020. The increase was primarily a result of higher taxable earnings due to the $845 million (U.S. $700 million) merger termination payment received in connection with KCS's termination of the Original Merger Agreement, partially offset by acquisition-related costs associated with the KCS acquisition and a lower effective tax rate.\nIncome tax expense was $758 million in 2020, an increase of $52 million, or 7%, from $706 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher taxable earnings and lower net income tax recoveries in 2020. In 2020, a tax filing election lowered the North Dakota rate resulting in net income tax recoveries of $29 million compared to 2019 when net income tax recoveries were $88 million as a result of an Alberta corporate tax rate decrease, partially offset by a 2019 tax expense for an unrecognized tax benefit of $24\u00a0million. \nThe effective income tax rate for 2021 was 21.23% on reported income and 23.85% on Adjusted income. The effective income tax rate for 2020 was 23.66% on reported income and 24.61% on Adjusted income. The effective income tax rate for 2019 was 22.43% on reported income and 24.96% on Adjusted income. Adjusted income is a Non-GAAP measure, which is discussed further in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \nThe Company's expected 2022 effective tax rate is between 24% and 24.5%, which excludes the impact of the change in the equity investment in KCS and associated deferred tax on the outside basis difference during the year. The Company\u2019s 2022 outlook for its effective tax rate is based on certain assumptions about events and developments that may or may not materialize, or that may be offset entirely or partially by new events and developments. These assumptions are discussed further in Item 1A. Risk Factors. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources \nThe Company's primary sources of liquidity include its Cash and cash equivalents, commercial paper program, bilateral letter of credit facilities, and revolving credit facility. The Company believes that these sources as well as cash flow generated through operations and existing debt capacity are adequate to meet its short-term and long-term cash requirements. The Company is not aware of any material trends, events, or uncertainties that would create any deficiencies in the Company's liquidity. \nDuring 2021, the Company obtained commitments for a 364-day senior unsecured facility (the \u201cbridge facility\u201d) in the amount of U.S. $8.5 billion to bridge debt financing required to fund a portion of the cash component of the KCS acquisition. This bridge facility was terminated on December 2, 2021 upon the issuance of debt. On December 14, 2021, the Company issued 262.6 million Common Shares to KCS common stockholders at the exchange ratio of 2.884 Common Shares per share of KCS common stock to fund the remaining component of the KCS acquisition.\nAs at December 31, 2021, the Company had $69 million of Cash and cash equivalents compared to $147\u00a0million at December 31, 2020. \nAs at December 31, 2021, the Company's revolving credit facility was undrawn, unchanged from December 31, 2020, from a total available amount of U.S. $1.3 billion. Effective April 9, 2021, the Company amended its revolving credit facility to modify certain provisions relating to the calculation of the financial covenant ratio in its revolving credit facility. Effective September 24, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to extend the two-year tranche and the five-year tranche of its revolving credit facility to September 27, 2023 and September 27, 2026, respectively. Effective September 29, 2021, the Company entered into a further amendment to its revolving credit facility in order to provide financial covenant flexibility for the anticipated acquisition financing pertaining to the KCS acquisition, which is in place for a two-year period from the date the acquisition closed. In 2021, the Company also entered into a U.S. $500 million unsecured non-revolving term credit facility with a maturity date of March 15, 2022. As at December 31, 2021, the unsecured non-revolving term credit facility was fully drawn. The credit facility agreements require the Company to maintain a financial covenant. As at \n \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT\n \n \n64\nDecember 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all terms and conditions of the credit facility arrangements and satisfied the financial covenants.\nThe Company has a commercial paper program that enables it to issue commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of U.S. $1.0 billion in the form of unsecured promissory notes. This commercial paper program is backed by the revolving credit facility. As at December 31, 2021, total commercial paper borrowings were U.S. $265 million (December 31, 2020 \u2013 U.S. $644 million).\nAs at December 31, 2021, under its bilateral letter of credit facilities, the Company had letters of credit drawn of $58 million from a total available amount of $300 million (December 31, 2020 - $59 million). Under the bilateral letter of credit facilities, the Company has the option to post collateral in the form of Cash or cash equivalents, equal at least to the face value of the letter of credit issued. As at December 31, 2021, the Company did not have any collateral posted on its bilateral letter of credit facilities (December 31, 2020 \u2013 $nil). \nContractual Commitments\nThe Company\u2019s material cash requirements from known contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments primarily consist of long-term debt and related interest, supplier purchases, leases, and other long term liabilities. Outstanding obligations related to debt and leases can be found in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 18 Debt and Note 21 Leases. Interest obligations related to debt and finance leases amount to $634 million within the next 12 months, with the remaining amount committed thereafter of $13,503 million. \nSupplier purchase agreements and other long-term liabilities amount to $676 million and $56 million within the next 12 months, respectively, with the remaining amount committed thereafter of $914 million and $435 million, respectively. Other long-term liabilities includes expected cash payments for environmental remediation, post-retirement benefits, worker\u2019s compensation benefits, long-term disability benefits, pension benefit payments for the Company\u2019s non-registered supplemental pension plan, and certain other long-term liabilities. Pension payments are discussed further in Critical Accounting Estimates of this Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nGuarantees\nRefer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 28\n \nGuarantees for details.\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities was $3,688 million in 2021, an increase of $886 million, or 32%, compared to $2,802 million in 2020. This increase was primarily due to higher cash generating income as a result of the $845 million merger termination payment received from KCS in the second quarter of 2021. \nCash provided by operating activities was $2,802 million in 2020, a decrease of $188 million, or 6%, compared to $2,990 million in 2019. This decrease was primarily due to lower receipts from customers in advance of performing services, compared to 2019.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $13,730 million in 2021, an increase of $11,700 million, or 576%, from $2,030 million in 2020. This increase was primarily due to cash payments made to KCS and their stockholders for the acquisition of KCS, compared to the acquisition of DRTP in 2020, as well as lower additions to properties during 2021. \nCash used in investing activities was $2,030 million in 2020, an increase of $227 million, or 13%, from $1,803 million in 2019. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of DRTP in 2020, compared to the acquisition of CMQ in 2019.\n65 \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT  \n \nCapital Programs\nFor the year ended December\u00a031\n(in millions of Canadian dollars, except for track miles and crossties)\n2021\n2020\n2019\nAdditions to capital\nTrack and roadway\n$\n970\n\u00a0\n$\n1,161\u00a0\n$\n1,004\u00a0\nRolling stock \n297\n\u00a0\n253\u00a0\n393\u00a0\nInformation systems software \n47\n\u00a0\n45\u00a0\n55\u00a0\nBuildings \n105\n\u00a0\n103\u00a0\n58\u00a0\nOther \n132\n\u00a0\n126\u00a0\n154\u00a0\nTotal \u2013 accrued additions to capital\n1,551\n\u00a0\n1,688\u00a0\n1,664\u00a0\nLess:\nNon-cash transactions\n19\n\u00a0\n17\u00a0\n17\u00a0\nCash invested in additions to properties (per Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows)\n$\n1,532\n\u00a0\n$\n1,671\u00a0\n$\n1,647\u00a0\nTrack installation capital programs\nTrack miles of rail laid (miles)\n284\n\u00a0\n301\u00a0\n246\u00a0\nTrack miles of rail capacity expansion (miles)\n9\n\u00a0\n28\u00a0\n11\u00a0\nCrossties installed (thousands)\n1,222\n\u00a0\n1,417\u00a0\n1,122\u00a0\nTrack and roadway expenditures include the replacement and enhancement of the Company\u2019s track infrastructure. Of the $970 million additions in 2021 (2020 \u2013 $1,161 million), approximately $907 million (2020 \u2013 $1,008 million) was invested in the renewal of depleted assets, namely rail, ties, ballast, signals, and bridges. Approximately $10 million (2020 \u2013 $25 million) was spent on Positive Train Control compliance requirements and $53 million (2020 \u2013 $128 million) was invested in network improvements and growth initiatives.\nRolling stock investments encompass locomotives and railcars. In 2021, expenditures on locomotives were approximately $121 million (2020 \u2013 $126 million) and were focused on the continued re-investment in CP's existing locomotive fleet. Railcar investment of approximately $176 million (2020 \u2013 $127 million) was largely focused on renewal of depleted assets, including the acquisition of covered hoppers for grain transportation.\nIn 2021, CP invested approximately\u00a0$47 million (2020 \u2013 $45 million) in information systems software primarily focused on rationalizing and enhancing business systems and providing real-time data. Investments in buildings were approximately $105\u00a0million (2020 - $103\u00a0million) and included items such as facility upgrades, renovations and shop equipment. Other items were $132 million (2020 \u2013 $126 million) and included investments in containers, work equipment and vehicles.\nFor 2022, CP expects to invest approximately $1.55 billion in its capital programs, which will be financed with cash generated from operations. Approximately 60% to 70% of the planned capital programs is for\u00a0track and roadway. Approximately 15% to 20% is expected to be allocated to rolling stock, including railcars and locomotive improvements. Approximately 5% is expected to be allocated to information services, and 5% is expected to be allocated to buildings. Other investments is expected to be 5% to 10%. Additional discussion of capital commitments can be found in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 27 Commitments and Contingencies.\nFree Cash\nCP generated positive Free cash of $1,793 million in 2021, an increase of $636 million, or 55%, from $1,157 million in 2020. This increase was primarily due to an increase in cash provided by operating activities, before the Merger termination fee and Acquisition-related costs from KCS, and lower capital additions.\nCP generated positive Free cash of $1,157 million in 2020, a decrease of $200 million, or 15%, from $1,357 million in 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cash provided by operating activities. \nFree cash is affected by seasonal fluctuations and by other factors including the size of the Company's capital programs. The 2021 capital programs are discussed above. Free cash is defined and reconciled in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT\n \n \n66\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities was $9,936 million in 2021, a change of $10,700 million, or 1401%, from cash used in financing activities of $764 million in 2020. This change was primarily due to issuances of U.S $6.7 billion and $2.2 billion notes and a U.S. \n$500\u00a0million\n term loan to fund the cash consideration component of the KCS acquisition, as well as a pause on payments to buy back shares under the Company's share repurchase program due to the KCS acquisition.\nThis was partially offset by: \n\u2022\nissuances of U.S. $500 million 2.050% notes due March 5, 2030 and $300 million 3.050% notes due March 9, 2050 in 2020;\n\u2022\nnet repayments of commercial paper during 2021 compared to net issuances during 2020; \n\u2022\nprincipal repayment of U.S. $250\u00a0million of the Company's 9.450% notes at maturity in August 2021; \n\u2022\nacquisition-related financing fees; and\n\u2022\nhigher dividends paid in 2021.\nCash used in financing activities was $764 million in 2020, a decrease of $347 million, or 31%, from $1,111 million in 2019. This decrease was primarily due to the issuances of U.S. $500 million 2.050% notes due March 5, 2030 and $300 million 3.050% notes due March 9, 2050 in 2020, compared to the issuance of $400 million 3.150% notes due March 13, 2029 in 2019, as well as the principal repayment of U.S. $350 million of the Company's 7.250% notes at maturity in May 2019. This was partially offset by higher payments to buy back shares under the Company's share repurchase program, lower net issuances of commercial paper during 2020, and higher dividends paid during 2020.\nCredit Measures\nCredit ratings provide information relating to the Company\u2019s operations and liquidity, and affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain short-term and long-term financing and/or the cost of such financing.\nA strong investment-grade credit rating is an important measure in assessing the Company\u2019s ability to maintain access to public financing and to minimize the cost of capital. It also affects the ability of the Company to engage in certain collateralized business activities on a cost-effective basis.\nCredit ratings and outlooks are based on the rating agencies\u2019 methodologies and can change from time to time to reflect their views of CP. Their views are affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, the Company\u2019s financial position and liquidity along with external factors beyond the Company\u2019s control.\nAs at December 31, 2021, CP's credit ratings from Standard & Poor's Rating Services (\"Standard & Poor's\") remain unchanged from December 31, 2020. During the first quarter of 2021, Moody's Investor Service (\"Moody's\") downgraded CP's credit rating to Baa2 from Baa1 due to the announcement of the KCS transaction.\nCredit ratings as at December 31, 2021\n(1)\nLong-term debt\nOutlook\nStandard & Poor's\nLong-term corporate credit\nBBB+\nstable\nSenior secured debt\nA\nstable\nSenior unsecured debt\nBBB+\nstable\nMoody's\nSenior unsecured debt\nBaa2\nstable\nCommercial paper program\nStandard & Poor's\nA-2\nN/A\nMoody's\nP-2\nN/A\n(1) \nCredit ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities and do not address the market price or suitability of a specific security for a particular investor. Credit ratings are based on the rating agencies' methodologies and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies.\nFinancial Ratios\nThe Long-term debt to Net income ratio was 7.1 in 2021, compared with 4.0 in 2020 and 3.6 in 2019. These increases were primarily due to higher debt. \n67 \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT  \n \nThe Adjusted net debt to Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (\"EBITDA\") ratio was 4.8 in 2021, compared with 2.5 in 2020 and 2.4 in 2019. The increase in the ratio from 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to a higher debt balance in connection with the KCS acquisition. The increase from 2019\n \nto\n \n2020 was primarily due to a higher debt balance, partially offset by an increase in Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio is defined and reconciled in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Over the long term, CP targets an Adjusted net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.0 to 2.5.\nAlthough CP has provided a target Non-GAAP measure (Adjusted net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio), management is unable to reconcile, without unreasonable efforts, the target Adjusted net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio to the most comparable GAAP measure (Long-term debt to Net income ratio), due to unknown variables and uncertainty related to future results. These unknown variables may include unpredictable transactions of significant value. In recent years, CP has recognized acquisition-related costs (including legal, consulting, and financing fees, fair value gain or loss on FX forward contracts and interest rate hedges, FX gain on U.S. dollar-denominated cash on hand from the issuances of long-term debt to fund the KCS acquisition, and transaction costs (net of tax) incurred by KCS which were recognized within the Equity loss of KCS), the merger termination payment received, changes in the outside basis tax difference between the carrying amount of CP's equity investment in KCS and its tax basis of the investment, changes in income tax rates, and a change to an uncertain tax item. KCS has also recognized significant transaction costs and FX gains and losses. These or other similar, large unforeseen transactions affect Net income but may be excluded from CP\u2019s Adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, the U.S.-to-Canada dollar exchange rate is unpredictable and can have a significant impact on CP\u2019s reported results but may be excluded from CP\u2019s Adjusted EBITDA. In particular, CP excludes the FX impact of translating the Company\u2019s debt and lease liabilities, interest and taxes from Adjusted EBITDA. Please see Forward-Looking Statements in this Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion.\nDividend Payout Ratio\nThe dividend payout ratio was 18.2% in 2021, compared with 19.8% in 2020 and 17.9% in 2019. The decrease in the ratio from 2020 to 2021 was due to higher diluted EPS, partially offset by higher dividends declared per share. The increase in the ratio from 2019 to 2020 was due to higher dividends declared per share, partially offset by higher diluted EPS.\nThe Adjusted dividend payout ratio was 20.2% in 2021, compared with 20.1% in 2020 and 19.1% in 2019. These increases were due to higher dividends declared per share, partially offset by higher Adjusted diluted EPS. Adjusted dividend payout ratio is defined and reconciled in Non-GAAP Measures of this Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Over the long term, CP targets an Adjusted dividend payout ratio of 25.0% to 30.0%.\nAlthough CP has provided a target Non-GAAP measure (Adjusted dividend payout ratio), management is unable to reconcile, without unreasonable efforts, the target Adjusted dividend payout ratio to the most comparable GAAP measure (Dividend payout ratio), due to unknown variables and uncertainty related to future results. These unknown variables may include unpredictable transactions of significant value. In recent years, CP has recognized acquisition-related costs (including legal, consulting, and financing fees, fair value gain or loss on FX forward contracts and interest rate hedges, FX gain on U.S. dollar-denominated cash on hand from the issuances of long-term debt to fund the KCS acquisition, and transaction costs (net of tax) incurred by KCS which were recognized within the Equity loss of KCS), the merger termination payment received, outside basis tax differences related to KCS equity earnings or loss, changes in income tax rates, and a change to an uncertain tax item. KCS has also recognized significant transaction costs and FX gains and losses. These or other similar, large unforeseen transactions affect Diluted EPS but may be excluded from CP\u2019s Adjusted diluted EPS. Additionally, the U.S.-to-Canada dollar exchange rate is unpredictable and can have a significant impact on CP\u2019s reported results but may be excluded from CP\u2019s Adjusted diluted EPS. In particular, CP excludes the FX impact of translating the Company\u2019s debt and lease liabilities from Adjusted diluted EPS. Please see Forward-Looking Statements in this Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion.\nSupplemental Guarantor Financial Information\nCanadian Pacific Railway Company (\u201cCPRC\u201d), a 100%-owned subsidiary of Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (\u201cCPRL\u201d), is the issuer of certain securities which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by CPRL on an unsecured basis. The other subsidiaries of CPRC do not guarantee the securities and are referred to below as the \u201cNon-Guarantor Subsidiaries\u201d. The following is a description of the terms and conditions of the guarantees with respect to securities for which CPRC is the issuer and CPRL provides a full and unconditional guarantee.\nAs of the date of the filing of the Form 10-K, CPRC had U.S. $12,050 million principal amount of debt securities outstanding due through 2115, and U.S. $30 million and GBP \u00a33 million in perpetual 4% consolidated debenture stock, for all of which CPRL is the guarantor subject to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\"), as amended. As of the same date, CPRC also had $3,300\u00a0million principal amount of debt securities issued under Canadian Securities Law due through 2050 for which CPRL is the guarantor and not subject to the Exchange Act.\nCPRL fully and unconditionally guarantees the payment of the principal (and premium, if any) and interest on the debt securities and consolidated debenture stock issued by CPRC, any sinking fund or analogous payments payable with respect to such securities, and any additional amounts payable when they become due, whether at maturity or otherwise. The guarantee is CPRL\u2019s unsubordinated and unsecured obligation and ranks equally with all of CPRL\u2019s other unsecured, unsubordinated obligations.\n \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT\n \n \n68\nCPRL will be released and relieved of its obligations under the guarantees after obligations to the holders are satisfied in accordance with the terms of the respective instruments. \nPursuant to Rule 13-01 of the SEC's Regulation S-X, the Company provides summarized financial and non-financial information of CPRC in lieu of providing separate financial statements of CPRC.\nMore information on the securities under this guarantee structure can be found in Exhibit 22.1 List of Issuers and Guarantor Subsidiaries of this annual report.\nSummarized Financial Information\nThe following tables present summarized financial information for CPRC (Subsidiary Issuer) and CPRL (Parent Guarantor) on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances among CPRC and CPRL; (ii) equity in earnings from and investments in the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries; and (iii) intercompany dividend income.\nStatements of Income\nCPRC (Subsidiary Issuer) and CPRL (Parent Guarantor)\n(in millions of Canadian dollars)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020\nTotal revenues\n$\n5,924\n\u00a0\n$\n5,797\u00a0\nTotal operating expenses\n3,712\n\u00a0\n3,263\u00a0\nOperating income \n(1)\n2,212\n\u00a0\n2,534\u00a0\nLess: Other \n(2)\n(522)\n127\u00a0\nIncome before income tax expense\n2,734\n\u00a0\n2,407\u00a0\nNet income\n$\n2,548\n\u00a0\n$\n1,792\u00a0\n(1)\n Includes net lease costs incurred from non-guarantor subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 of $431 million and $435 million, respectively. \n(2)\n Includes Other expense (income), Merger termination fee, Other components of net periodic benefit recovery, and Net interest expense.\nBalance Sheets\nCPRC (Subsidiary Issuer) and CPRL (Parent Guarantor)\n(in millions of Canadian dollars)\nAs at December 31, 2021\nAs at December 31, 2020\nAssets\nCurrent assets\n$\n963\n\u00a0\n$\n907\u00a0\nProperties\n11,342\n\u00a0\n10,865\u00a0\nOther non-current assets\n2,536\n\u00a0\n1,151\u00a0\nLiabilities\nCurrent liabilities\n$\n2,789\n\u00a0\n$\n2,290\u00a0\nLong-term debt\n18,574\n\u00a0\n8,585\u00a0\nOther non-current liabilities\n3,008\n\u00a0\n2,981\u00a0\n69 \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT  \n \nExcluded from the Income Statements and Balance Sheets above are the following significant intercompany transactions and balances that CPRC and CPRL have with the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries:\nCash Transactions with Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries\nCPRC (Subsidiary Issuer) and CPRL (Parent Guarantor)\n(in millions of Canadian dollars)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020\nDividend income from non-guarantor subsidiaries\n$\n297\n\u00a0\n$\n163\u00a0\nCapital contributions to non-guarantor subsidiaries\n(134)\n\u2014\u00a0\nReturn of capital from non-guarantor subsidiaries\n1,370\n\u00a0\n198\u00a0\nBalances with Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries\nCPRC (Subsidiary Issuer) and CPRL (Parent Guarantor)\n(in millions of Canadian dollars)\nAs at December 31, 2021\nAs at December 31, 2020\nAssets\nAccounts Receivable, intercompany\n$\n344\n\u00a0\n$\n327\u00a0\nShort-term advances to affiliates\n2,859\n\u00a0\n20\u00a0\nLong-term advances to affiliates\n7,616\n\u00a0\n9\u00a0\nLiabilities\nAccounts payable, intercompany\n$\n212\n\u00a0\n$\n179\u00a0\nShort-term advances from affiliates\n2,777\n\u00a0\n3,658\u00a0\nLong-term advances from affiliates\n82\n\u00a0\n82\u00a0\nShare Capital\nAt February\u00a022, 2022, the latest practicable date prior to the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there were 929,712,071 Common Shares and no preferred shares issued and outstanding, which consists of 15,332 holders of record of the Common Shares. In addition, CP has a Management Stock Option Incentive Plan (\u201cMSOIP\u201d), under which key officers and employees are granted options to purchase the Common Shares. Options issued prior to the share split further described in Results of Operations of this Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations now each provide rights over five shares. For consistency, all number of options presented herein are shown on the basis of the number of shares subject to the options\n.\n At February\u00a022, 2022, 8,144,004 options were outstanding under the MSOIP and stand-alone option agreements entered into with Mr. Keith Creel. There are 2,504,311 options available to be issued by the Company\u2019s MSOIP in the future. CP also has a Director's Stock Option Plan (\u201cDSOP\u201d), under which directors are granted options to purchase Common Shares. There are no outstanding options under the DSOP, which has 1,700,000 options available to be issued in the future. \nNon-GAAP Measures\nThe Company presents Non-GAAP measures to provide a basis for evaluating underlying earnings and liquidity trends in the Company\u2019s business that can be compared with the results of operations in prior periods. In addition, these Non-GAAP measures facilitate a multi-period assessment of long-term profitability, allowing management and other external users of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial information to compare profitability on a long-term basis, including assessing future profitability, with that of the Company\u2019s peers. \nThese Non-GAAP measures have no standardized meaning and are not defined by GAAP and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The presentation of these Non-GAAP measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. \nNon-GAAP Performance Measures\nThe Company uses adjusted earnings results including Adjusted income, Adjusted diluted earnings per share, Adjusted operating income, and Adjusted operating ratio to evaluate the Company\u2019s operating performance and for planning and forecasting future business operations and future profitability. \n \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT\n \n \n70\nThese Non-GAAP measures are discussed further in other sections of this Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. These Non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operating results because they exclude certain significant items that are not considered indicative of future financial trends either by nature or amount. As a result, these items are excluded for management assessment of operational performance, allocation of resources, and preparation of annual budgets. These significant items may include, but are not limited to, restructuring and asset impairment charges, individually significant gains and losses from sales of assets, acquisition-related costs (including legal, consulting, and financing fees, fair value gain or loss on FX forward contracts and interest rate hedges, FX gain on U.S. dollar-denominated cash on hand from the issuances of long-term debt to fund the KCS acquisition, and transaction costs (net of tax) incurred by KCS which were recognized within the Equity loss of KCS), the merger termination payment received, the FX impact of translating the Company\u2019s debt and lease liabilities (including borrowings under the credit facility), discrete tax items, changes in the outside basis tax difference between the carrying amount of CP's equity investment in KCS and its tax basis of this investment, changes in income tax rates, changes to an uncertain tax item, and certain items outside the control of management. These items may not be non-recurring. However, excluding these significant items from GAAP results allows for a consistent understanding of the Company's consolidated financial performance when performing a multi-period assessment including assessing the likelihood of future results. Accordingly, these Non-GAAP financial measures may provide insight to investors and other external users of the Company's consolidated financial information.\nIn 2021, there were four significant items included in Net income as follows:\n\u2022\nin the fourth quarter, a deferred tax recovery of $33 million on changes in the outside basis difference of the equity investment in KCS that favourably impacted Diluted EPS by 5 cents;  \n\u2022\nin the second quarter, merger termination payment received of $845 million ($748 million after current taxes) in connection with KCS's termination of the Original Merger Agreement effective May 21, 2021, that favourably impacted Diluted EPS by $1.11;\n\u2022\nduring the course of the year, acquisition-related costs of $599\u00a0million in connection with the KCS acquisition ($500 million after current tax recovery of $107 million net of deferred tax expense of $8 million), including an expense of $183\u00a0million recognized in Purchased services and other, $169 million recognized in Equity loss of KCS, and $247\u00a0million recognized in Other expense (income), that unfavourably impacted Diluted EPS by 75 cents as follows:\n\u2013\nin the fourth quarter, acquisition-related costs of $157\u00a0million ($157 million after current tax recovery of $13 million net of deferred tax expense of $13 million), including costs of $36\u00a0million recognized in Purchased services and other, $169 million in Equity loss of KCS, and a $48\u00a0million\u00a0recovery recognized in Other (income) expense, that unfavourably impacted Diluted EPS by 22 cents; \n\u2013\nin the third quarter, acquisition-related costs of $98\u00a0million ($80 million after current tax recovery of $61 million net of deferred tax expense of $43 million), including costs of $15\u00a0million recognized in Purchased services and other and $83\u00a0million recognized in Other expense (income), that unfavourably impacted Diluted EPS by 12 cents;

Adjusted ROIC is calculated as Adjusted return divided by Adjusted average invested capital. Adjusted return is defined as Net income adjusted for interest expense, tax effected at the Company\u2019s adjusted annualized effective tax rate, and significant items in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements, tax effected at the applicable tax rate. Adjusted average invested capital is defined as the sum of total Shareholders' equity, Long-term debt, and Long-term debt maturing within one year, as presented in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, each averaged between the beginning and ending balance over a rolling 12-month period, adjusted for the impact of significant items, tax effected at the applicable tax rate, on closing balances as part of this average. Adjusted ROIC excludes significant items reported in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, as these significant items are not considered indicative of future financial trends either by nature or amount, and excludes interest expense, net of tax, to incorporate returns on the Company\u2019s overall capitalization. Adjusted ROIC is a performance measure that measures how productively the Company uses its long-term capital investments, representing critical indicators of good operating and investment decisions made by management, and is an important performance criteria in determining certain elements of the Company's long-term incentive plan. Adjusted ROIC, which is reconciled below from Return on average shareholders' equity, the most comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, is discussed further in Results of Operations of this Item 7.

Free cash is a measure that management considers to be a valuable indicator of liquidity. Free cash is useful to investors and other external users of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as it assists with the evaluation of the Company's ability to generate cash to satisfy debt obligations and discretionary activities such as dividends, share repurchase programs, and other strategic opportunities. The cash settlement of forward starting swaps that occurred in conjunction with the issuance of long-term debt, the acquisition-related costs associated with the KCS acquisition, and the merger termination payment received related to KCS's termination of the Original Merger Agreement are not indicative of operating trends and have been excluded from Free cash. Similarly, the acquisitions of KCS, CMQ, and DRTP are not indicative of investment trends and have also been excluded from Free cash. Free cash should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, Cash provided by operating activities.

Using the most current information available, the Company reviews estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to environmental liabilities, pensions and other benefits, property, plant and equipment, deferred income taxes, and personal injury and other claims liabilities.\nThe development, selection and disclosure of these estimates, and this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, have been reviewed by the Board of Directors\u2019 Audit and Finance Committee, which is composed entirely of independent directors.\nEnvironmental Liabilities\nEnvironmental remediation accruals cover site-specific remediation programs. CP estimates of the probable costs to be incurred in the remediation of properties contaminated by past activities reflect the nature of contamination at individual sites according to typical activities and scale of operations conducted. The Company screens and classifies sites according to typical activities and scale of operations conducted. CP has developed remediation strategies for each property based on the nature and extent of the contamination, as well as the location of the property and surrounding areas that may be adversely affected by the presence of contaminants. CP also considers available technologies, treatment and disposal facilities and the acceptability of site-specific plans based on the local regulatory environment. Site-specific plans range from containment and risk management of the contaminants through to the removal and treatment of the contaminants and affected soils and groundwater. The details of the estimates reflect the environmental liability at each property. The Company is committed to fully meeting regulatory and legal obligations with respect to environmental matters. \nSome sites include remediation activities that are projected beyond the 10-year period, which CP is unable to reasonably estimate and determine. Therefore, CP's accruals of the environmental liabilities are based on an estimate of costs for a rolling 10-year period covered by the environmental program. Payments are expected to be made over 10 years to 2031. \nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020 the Company's provision for specific environmental sites was as follows: \n(in millions of Canadian dollars)\n2021\n2020\nBeginning of the year\n$\n80\n\u00a0\n$\n77\u00a0\nAccruals and other\n10\n\u00a0\n10\u00a0\nPayments\n(10)\n(6)\nForeign Exchange\n(1)\n(1)\nEnd of the year\n$\n79\n\u00a0\n$\n80\u00a0\nCurrent portion \u2013 end of the year\n$\n11\n\u00a0\n$\n9\u00a0\nProvisions for environmental remediation costs are recorded in \u201cOther long-term liabilities\u201d (refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 20 Other long-term liabilities), except for the current portion which is recorded in \u201cAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\u201d (refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 17 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities). The accruals for environmental remediation represent CP\u2019s best estimate of its probable future obligations and include both asserted and unasserted claims, without reduction for anticipated recoveries from third parties. Although the recorded accruals include CP\u2019s best estimate of all probable costs, CP\u2019s total environmental remediation costs cannot be predicted with certainty. Accruals for environmental remediation may change from time to time as new information about previously untested sites becomes known, environmental laws and regulations evolve and advances are made in environmental remediation technology. The accruals may also vary as the courts decide legal proceedings against outside parties responsible for contamination. These potential charges, which cannot be quantified at this time, are not expected to be material to the Company\u2019s financial position, but may materially affect income in the period in which a charge is recognized. \n \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT\n \n \n80\nThe environmental liabilities are also sensitive to the increase in cost of materials which would be reflected as increases to \"Other long-term liabilities\" and \"Accounts payable and accrued liabilities\" on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets and to \"Purchased services and other\" within Operating expenses on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. CP's cash payments for environmental initiatives were $6 million in 2020, $10 million in 2021 and are estimated to be approximately $11 million in 2022, $9 million in 2023, $8 million in 2024 and a total of approximately $53 million over the remaining years through 2031. All payments will be funded from general operations.\nPensions and Other Benefits\nCP has defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. Other benefits include post-retirement medical and life insurance for pensioners, and some post-employment workers\u2019 compensation and long-term disability benefits in Canada. Workers\u2019 compensation and long-term disability benefits are discussed in the Personal Injury and Other Claims Liabilities section below.\nThe obligations and costs for pensions and other benefits are based on the discounted present value of future benefits. The underlying benefits are paid over many years and are estimated based on uncertain demographic and economic assumptions. As a result, the obligations and costs themselves involve a significant amount of estimation uncertainty.\nInformation concerning the measurement of obligations and costs for pensions and other benefits is discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1 Summary of significant accounting policies and Note 24 Pensions and other benefits. Note 24 Pensions and other benefits includes three years of results for obligations, costs and significant actuarial assumptions.\nNet Periodic Benefit Costs\nThe Company reports the current service cost component of net periodic benefit cost in \"Compensation and benefits\" for pensions and post-retirement benefits and in \"Purchased services and other\" for self-insured workers' compensation and long-term disability benefits on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The Other components of net periodic benefit recovery are reported as a separate line item outside of Operating income on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Components of the net periodic benefit costs (credits) are as follows:\n\u00a0\n2021\n2020\n(in millions of Canadian dollars)\nCurrent service cost\nOther components\nTotal\nCurrent service cost\nOther components\nTotal\nDefined benefit pensions\n$\n171\n\u00a0\n$\n(402)\n$\n(231)\n$\n140\u00a0\n$\n(363)\n$\n(223)\nDefined contribution pensions\n13\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n13\n\u00a0\n12\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n12\u00a0\nPost-retirement benefits\n5\n\u00a0\n17\n\u00a0\n22\n\u00a0\n4\u00a0\n17\u00a0\n21\u00a0\nSelf-insured workers' compensation and long-term disability benefits\n8\n\u00a0\n(2)\n6\n\u00a0\n8\u00a0\n4\u00a0\n12\u00a0\nAll plans\n$\n197\n\u00a0\n$\n(387)\n$\n(190)\n$\n164\u00a0\n$\n(342)\n$\n(178)\nCP estimates net periodic benefit credits for defined benefit pensions to be approximately $275 million in 2022 ($147 million in current service cost and $422 million in other components of net periodic recovery), and net periodic benefit costs for defined contribution pensions to be approximately $13 million in 2022. Net periodic benefit costs for post-retirement benefits in 2022 are expected to be slightly lower than the 2021 costs. Total net periodic benefit credits for all plans are estimated to be approximately $234 million in 2022 (2021 \u2013 $190 million), comprising $171 million (2021 \u2013 $197 million) in current service cost and $405 million (2021 \u2013 $387 million) in other components of net periodic recovery. The expected rate of return on the market-related asset value used to compute the net periodic benefit credit was 7.25% in 2020 and 6.90% in 2021. For computing the net periodic benefit credit in 2022, the Company is continuing to use 6.90% to reflect CP's current view of future long-term investment returns. Net periodic benefit costs and credits are discussed further in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 24 Pensions and other benefits.\nPension Plan Contributions\nThe Company made contributions of $18 million to the defined benefit pension plans in 2021, compared with $27 million in 2020. The Company\u2019s main Canadian defined benefit pension plan accounts for nearly all of CP\u2019s pension obligation and can produce significant volatility in pension funding requirements, given the pension fund\u2019s size, the many factors that drive the pension plan\u2019s funded status, and Canadian statutory pension funding requirements. The Company made voluntary prepayments of $600 million in 2011, $650 million in 2010, and $500 million in 2009 to the Company\u2019s main Canadian defined benefit pension plan. CP has applied $1,324 million of these voluntary prepayments to reduce its pension funding requirements in 2012\u20132021, leaving $426 million of the voluntary prepayments still available at December 31, 2021 to reduce CP\u2019s pension funding requirements in 2022 and future years. CP continues to have significant flexibility with respect to the rate at which the remaining voluntary prepayments are applied to reduce future years\u2019 pension contribution requirements, which allows CP to manage the volatility of future pension funding requirements. At this time, CP estimates it will not apply any of the remaining voluntary prepayments against its 2022 pension funding requirements.\n81 \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT  \n \nCP estimates its aggregate pension contributions, including its defined benefit and defined contribution plans, to be in the range of $25 million to $35 million in 2022, and in the range of $25 million to $50 million per year from 2023 to 2025. These estimates reflect the Company\u2019s current intentions with respect to the rate at which CP will apply the remaining voluntary prepayments against contribution requirements in the next few years. \nFuture pension contributions will be highly dependent on the Company\u2019s actual experience with respect to variables such as investment returns, interest rate fluctuations, and demographic changes, on the rate at which previous years\u2019 voluntary prepayments are applied against pension contribution requirements, and on any changes in the regulatory environment. CP will continue to make contributions to the pension plans that, at a minimum, meet pension legislative requirements.\nPension Plan Risks\nFluctuations in the obligations and net periodic benefit costs for pensions result from favourable or unfavourable investment returns, changes to the outlook for future investment returns, and changes in long-term interest rates. The impact of favourable or unfavourable investment returns is moderated by the use of a market-related asset value for the main Canadian defined benefit pension plan\u2019s public equity securities and absolute return strategies. The impact of changes in long-term interest rates on pension obligations is partially offset by their impact on the pension funds\u2019 investments in fixed income assets.\nThe plans\u2019 investment policy provides a target allocation of approximately 45% of the plans\u2019 assets to be invested in public equity securities. As a result, stock market performance is a key driver in determining the pension funds\u2019 asset performance. If the rate of investment return on the plans\u2019 public equity securities in 2021 had been 10% higher (or lower) than the actual 2021 rate of investment return on such securities, 2022 net periodic benefit costs for pensions would be lower (or higher) by approximately $26 million.\nChanges to the outlook for future long-term investment returns can result in changes to the expected rate of return on the market-related asset value used to compute the net periodic benefit credit. If the expected rate of return as at December 31, 2021 had been higher (or lower) by 0.1%, 2022 net periodic benefit recoveries for pensions would be higher (or lower) by approximately $14 million.\nChanges in bond yields can result in changes to discount rates and to the value of fixed income assets. If the discount rate as at December\u00a031, 2021 had been higher (or lower) by 0.1% with no related changes in the value of the pension funds\u2019 investment in fixed income assets, 2022 net periodic benefit recoveries for pensions would be higher (or lower) by approximately $14 million and 2022 current service costs for pensions would be lower (or higher) by approximately $6 million. However, a change in bond yields would also lead to a change in the value of the pension funds\u2019 investment in fixed income assets, and this change would partially offset the impact on net periodic benefit costs noted above.\nThe Company estimates that an increase in the discount rate of 0.1% would decrease the defined benefit pension plans\u2019 projected benefit obligations by approximately $182 million, and that a decrease in the discount rate of 0.1% would increase the defined benefit pension plans\u2019 projected benefit obligations by approximately $187 million. Similarly, for every 0.1% the actual return on assets varies above (or below) the estimated return for the year, the value of the defined benefit pension plans\u2019 assets would increase (or decrease) by approximately $15 million.\nAdverse experience with respect to these factors could eventually increase funding and pension expense significantly, while favourable experience with respect to these factors could eventually decrease funding and pension expense significantly.\nFluctuations in the post-retirement benefit obligation also can result from changes in the discount rate used. A 0.1% increase (decrease) in the discount rate would decrease (increase) the obligation by approximately $5 million.\nCP reviews its pensioner mortality experience to ensure that the mortality assumption continues to be appropriate, or to determine what changes to the assumption are needed.\n \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT\n \n \n82\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nThe Company follows the group depreciation method under which a single depreciation rate is applied to the total cost in a particular class of property, despite differences in the service life or salvage value of individual properties within the same class.\u00a0CP performs depreciation studies of each property asset class approximately every three years to update depreciation rates. The studies are conducted with assistance from third-party specialists and analyzed and reviewed by the Company's management. Depreciation studies for U.S. assets are reviewed and approved by the STB.\u00a0Depreciation studies for Canadian assets are provided to the Canadian Transportation Agency (the \"Agency\"), but the Agency does not approve depreciation rates. In determining appropriate depreciation rates, management is required to make judgments and assumptions about a variety of key factors that are subject to future variability due to inherent uncertainties.\u00a0These include the following:\nKey Assumptions\nAssessments \n\u2022\nWhole and remaining asset lives \n\u2022\nStatistical analysis of historical retirement patterns; \n\u2022\nEvaluation of management strategy and its impact on operations and the future use of specific property assets;\n\u2022\nAssessment of technological advances;\n\u2022\nEngineering estimates of changes in current operations and analysis of historic, current and projected future usage;\n\u2022\nAdditional factors considered for track assets: density of traffic and whether rail is new or has been re-laid in a subsequent position; \n\u2022\nAssessment of policies and practices for the management of assets including maintenance; and\n\u2022\nComparison with industry data.\n\u2022\nSalvage values\n\u2022\nAnalysis of historical, current and estimated future salvage values.\nCP depreciates the cost of properties, net of salvage, on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the class of property. The estimates of economic lives are uncertain and can vary due to changes in any of the assessed factors noted in the table above for whole and remaining asset lives. Additionally, the depreciation rates are updated to reflect the change in residual values of the assets in the class. \nIt is anticipated that there will be changes in the estimates of weighted-average useful lives and net salvage for each property asset class as assets are acquired, used and retired. Substantial changes in either the useful lives of properties or the salvage assumptions could result in significant changes to depreciation expense.\u00a0For example, if the estimated average life of track assets, including rail, ties, ballast and other track material, increased (or decreased) by one year, annual depreciation expense would decrease (or increase) by approximately $18 million. \nDue to the capital intensive nature of the railway industry, depreciation represents a significant part of operating expenses. The estimated useful lives of properties have a direct impact on the amount of depreciation recorded as a component of \"Properties\" on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, accumulated depreciation was $8,651 million and $8,629 million, respectively.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nCP accounts for deferred income taxes based on the liability method. This method focuses on the Company\u2019s balance sheet and the temporary differences otherwise calculated from the comparison of book versus tax values. The provision for deferred income taxes arises from temporary differences in the carrying values of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes and the effect of loss carry forwards. The provision amount is sensitive to any changes in book and tax values and changes to statutory tax rates. For example, a change in temporary differences of $10 million would result in an approximate deferred income tax change of $3 million.\n \nIt is assumed that such temporary differences will be settled in the deferred income tax assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.\nIn determining deferred income taxes, the Company makes estimates and assumptions regarding deferred tax matters, including estimating the timing of the realization and settlement of deferred income tax assets (including the benefit of tax losses) and liabilities, and estimating unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. Deferred income taxes are calculated using enacted federal, provincial, and state future income tax rates, which may differ in future periods.\nDeferred income tax expense is included in \"Income tax expense\" on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, deferred income tax expense was $242\u00a0million and $221\u00a0million, respectively. Management does anticipate the total net deferred tax liabilities will change significantly within the next 12 months as a result of the pending business combination with KCS, subject to STB approval. A future fair value remeasurement of the carrying value of the Company's investment in KCS would result in a change in the deferred tax liability recognized in CP\u2019s income statement. Upon the Company obtaining control, the entire deferred tax liability reflecting the outside basis of the investment in KCS would be reversed through deferred tax expense in CP\u2019s income statement. Under a business combination, the Company would allocate the purchase price to the individual assets and liabilities assumed, and goodwill would be recognized. A deferred tax liability would be recognized on an inside basis based on the liability \n83 \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT  \n \nmethod described above with a resultant offsetting increase in goodwill. Additional disclosures are provided in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 6 Income taxes.\nPersonal Injury and Other Claims Liabilities\nCP estimates the potential liability arising from incidents, claims and pending litigations relating to personal injury claims by employees, third-party claims, certain occupation-related claims and property damage claims.\nPersonal Injury\nIn Canada, employee occupational injuries are governed by provincial workers' compensation legislation. Occupational injury claims in the provinces of Qu\u00e9bec, Ontario, Manitoba and B.C. are self-insured and administered through each Worker's Compensation Board (\"WCB\"). The future costs related to occupation-related injuries are actuarially determined based on past experience and assumptions associated with the injury, compensation, income replacement, health care and administrative costs. In the four provinces where the Company is self-insured, a discount rate is applied to the future estimated costs based on market rates for investment-grade corporate bonds to determine the liability. An actuarial study is performed on an annual basis. In the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta, the Company is assessed an annual WCB contribution on a premium basis and this amount is not subject to estimation by management. Changes to these assumptions could have a material adverse impact to the Company's results of operations, financial position and liquidity. At December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, respectively, the WCB liability was $77 million and $84 million in \"Pension and other benefit liabilities\"; $11 million and $11 million in \"Accounts payable and accrued liabilities\", offset by deposits paid to WCB of $1 million and $1 million in \"Other assets\" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFluctuations in WCB can result from changes in the discount rate used. A 0.1% increase (decrease) in the discount rate would decrease (increase) the obligation by approximately $1 million.\nU.S. railway employees are covered by federal law under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (\"FELA\") rather than workers' compensation programs. Accruals are set for individual cases based on facts, legal opinion and statistical analysis. U.S. accruals are also set and include alleged occupational exposure or injury. \nOther Claims \nA provision for litigation matters, equipment damages or other claims will be accrued according to applicable accounting standards and any such accrual will be based on an ongoing assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the litigation or claim and its likelihood of success, together with an evaluation of the damages or other monetary relief sought. CP accrues for probable claims when the facts of an incident become known and investigation results provide a reasonable basis for estimating the liability. The lower end of the range is accrued if the facts and circumstances permit only a range of reasonable estimates and no single amount in that range is a better estimate than any other. Facts and circumstances related to asserted claims can change, and a process is in place to monitor accruals for changes in accounting estimates. The final outcome with respect to actions outstanding or pending at December 31, 2021 or with respect to future claims cannot be predicted with certainty. Material changes to litigation trends, equipment damages or other claims could have a material adverse impact to the Company's results of operations, financial position and liquidity.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the \nUnited States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\n and forward-looking information within the meaning of other relevant securities legislation, including applicable securities laws in Canada (collectively referred to herein as \"forward-looking statements\").

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve numerous inherent risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, including but not limited to the following factors: changes in business strategies; general North American and global economic, credit and business conditions; risks associated with agricultural production such as weather conditions and insect populations; the availability and price of energy commodities; the effects of competition and pricing pressures; industry capacity; shifts in market demand; changes in commodity prices; uncertainty surrounding timing and volumes of commodities being shipped via CP; inflation; geopolitical instability; changes in laws, regulations and government policies, including regulation of rates; changes in taxes and tax rates; potential increases in maintenance and operating costs; changes in fuel prices; uncertainties of investigations, proceedings or other types of claims and litigation; labour disputes; risks and liabilities arising from derailments; transportation of dangerous goods; timing of completion of capital and maintenance projects; currency and interest rate fluctuations; effects of changes in market conditions and discount rates on the financial position of pension plans and investments; trade restrictions or other changes to international trade arrangements; climate change; various events that could disrupt operations, including severe weather, such as droughts, floods, avalanches and earthquakes, and cybersecurity attacks, as well as security threats and governmental response to them, and technological changes; and the pandemic created by the outbreak of COVID-19 and its variants and resulting effects on economic conditions, the demand environment for logistics requirements and energy prices, restrictions imposed by public health authorities or governments, fiscal and monetary policy responses by governments and financial institutions, and disruptions to global supply chains. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive.\nThere are more specific factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements contained in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Annual Report on Form 10-K. These more specific factors are identified and discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Other risks are detailed from time to time in reports filed by CP with securities regulators in Canada and the United States.\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Annual Report on Form 10-K are made as of the date hereof. Except as required by law, CP undertakes no obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, or the foregoing assumptions and risks affecting such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n85 \n \nCP 2021 ANNUAL REPORT  \n ", "item7a": ">ITEM 7A. \nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nForeign Exchange Risk\nAlthough CP conducts business primarily in Canada, a significant portion of its revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities including debt are denominated in U.S. dollars. In addition, equity earnings or losses of KCS are denominated in U.S. dollars. The value of the Canadian dollar is affected by a number of domestic and international factors, including, without limitation, economic performance, and Canadian, U.S. and international monetary policies. Consequently, the Company\u2019s results are affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between these currencies. In 2022, CP expects that every $0.01 weakening (or strengthening) of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, positively (or negatively) impacts Total revenues by approximately $30 million (2020 \u2013 approximately $27 million), negatively (or positively) impacts Operating expenses by approximately $13 million (2020 \u2013 approximately $14 million), and negatively (or positively) impacts Net interest expense by approximately $3 million (2020 \u2013 approximately $3 million) on an annualized basis.\nCP uses U.S. dollar-denominated debt and operating lease liabilities to hedge its net investment in U.S. operations. As at December 31, 2021, the net investment in U.S. operations is greater than the total U.S. denominated debt. Consequently, FX translation on the Company's unhedged net investment in U.S. operations is recognized in Other comprehensive income. There is no additional impact on earnings in Other expense (income) related to the FX translation on the Company\u2019s debt and operating lease liabilities. \nTo manage its exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates between Canadian and U.S. dollars, CP may sell or purchase U.S. dollar forwards at fixed rates in future periods. In addition, changes in the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and other currencies (including the U.S. dollar) make the goods transported by the Company more or less competitive in the world marketplace and may in turn positively or negatively affect revenues. \nSubject to final approval by the STB, CP anticipates consummating a business combination with KCS at which time CP will also reassess its functional currency.\nShare Price Impact on Stock-Based Compensation\nBased on information available at December 31, 2021 and expectations for 2022 grants, for every $1.00 change in share price, stock-based compensation expense has a corresponding change of approximately $1.5 million to $2.0 million (2020 \u2013 approximately $2.0 million to $2.8 million). This excludes the impact of changes in share price relative to the S&P/TSX 60 Index, S&P 500 Industrials Index, and to Class I railways, which may trigger different performance share unit payouts. Stock-based compensation may also be impacted by non-market performance conditions.\nAdditional information concerning stock-based compensation is included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 25 Stock-based compensation.\nInterest Rate Risk\nDebt financing forms part of the Company's capital structure. The debt agreements entered into expose CP to increased interest costs on future fixed debt instruments and existing variable rate debt instruments, should market rates increase. As at December 31, 2021, a hypothetical one percentage point change in interest rates on the Company's floating rate debt obligations outstanding is not material. In addition, the present value of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities will also vary with interest rate changes. To manage interest rate exposure, CP may enter into forward rate agreements such as treasury rate locks or bond forwards that lock in rates for a future date, thereby protecting against interest rate increases. CP may also enter into swap agreements whereby one party agrees to pay a fixed rate of interest while the other party pays a floating rate. Contingent on the direction of interest rates, the Company may incur higher costs depending on the contracted rate.\nThe fair value of the Company\u2019s fixed rate debt may fluctuate with changes in market interest rates. A hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2021 would result in an increase of approximately $2.3\u00a0billion to the fair value of the Company's debt as at December 31, 2021 (December 31, 2020 - approximately $1.5\u00a0billion). Fair values of CP\u2019s fixed rate debt are estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates, but do not consider other factors that could impact actual results.\nInformation concerning market risks is supplemented in Item 8.
