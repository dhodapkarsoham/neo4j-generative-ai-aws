{"item1": ">Item 1.\n\u00a0\nBusiness\n \nGeneral \n \nBank of the James Financial Group, Inc. (\u201cFinancial\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a bank holding company with its headquarters in Lynchburg, Virginia.  Financial was incorporated at the direction of Bank of the James (the \u201cBank\u201d or \u201cBank of the James\u201d) on October\u00a03, 2003 to serve as a bank holding company of the Bank. Financial acquired all of the shares of the Bank in a statutory share exchange on a one-for-one basis on January\u00a01, 2004.  \n \nThe Bank is a Virginia banking corporation headquartered in Lynchburg, Virginia. The Bank was incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia as a state-chartered bank in 1998 and began banking operations in July 1999. The Bank was organized to engage in general retail and commercial banking business. \n \nThe Bank\u2019s principal office is located at 828 Main Street, Lynchburg, Virginia 24504 and its telephone number is (434) 846-2000. The Bank also maintains a website at www.bankofthejames.bank. \n \nFinancial conducts three principal activities: (1) general retail and commercial banking through Bank of the James; (2) mortgage brokerage services through Bank of the James Mortgage, a division of the Bank (the \u201cMortgage Division\u201d); and (3) investment advisory services through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Pettyjohn, Wood & White, Inc. (\u201cPWW\u201d).  Because Financial acquired PWW on December 31, 2021, PWW had no effect on Financial\u2019s net income for the periods ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n \nIn addition, Financial provides securities brokerage and other investment services through BOTJ Investment, a division of the Bank, and acts as an agent for insurance and annuity products through BOTJ Insurance, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank.  The operating results of these business operations have not had a material impact on our financial performance and are not considered principal activities of Financial at this time.\n \nThe Bank, BOTJ Insurance, BOTJ Investment Group, Inc., a non-operating subsidiary, and PWW are our only subsidiaries and primary assets.\n \n\u200e\n \n\n\n4\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\n \n \nProducts and Services\n \nRetail and Commercial Banking\n \nThe Bank currently conducts business within Virginia from 16 full-service offices, two limited service offices, and one residential mortgage loan production office.  The location of and services provided by each of our facilities is described in \u201cItem 2.  Properties\u201d below.  The Bank established a mortgage loan origination division that conducts business under the name \u201cBank of the James Mortgage, a Division of Bank of the James.\u201d  The Mortgage Division conducts business primarily from the division\u2019s main office located in the Forest branch of the Bank.  In addition, the Bank expanded into Charlottesville in 2013 (opening a full-service branch in 2015), Harrisonburg in 2014 (opening a full-service branch in 2015), Appomattox in 2016 (opening a permanent full-service branch in 2017), Roanoke in 2013 (opening a full-service branch in 2017), Blacksburg in 2018 (opening a mortgage origination office), Lexington in 2019 with a full-service branch, and Rustburg in 2019 with a full-service branch.\n \nDeposit Services\n. Deposits are a major source of our funding. The Bank offers a full range of deposit services that are typically available in most banks and other financial institutions including checking accounts, savings accounts and other time deposits of various types, ranging from daily money market accounts to longer-term certificates of deposit. The transaction accounts and time certificates are tailored to the Bank\u2019s market area at rates competitive to those offered in the market area. In addition, the Bank offers its customers Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and Health Care Savings Accounts (HSAs). All deposit accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the \u201cFDIC\u201d) up to the maximum amount allowed by law (generally, $250,000 per depositor, subject to aggregation rules). The Bank solicits such accounts from individuals, businesses, associations and organizations, and governmental authorities. \n \nLending Services\n. The Bank offers a full range of short- to medium-term commercial and consumer loans. Our primary focus is on making loans to small and medium-sized businesses and consumers in the Region 2000 (Lynchburg, Amherst, Bedford, Campbell) area, Charlottesville, Harrisonburg, Roanoke, Appomattox, and Blacksburg. In addition, we also provide a wide range of real estate finance services. Commercial loans include both secured and unsecured loans for working capital (including inventory and receivables), business expansion (including acquisition of real estate and improvements), and purchase of equipment and machinery. Consumer loans include secured and unsecured loans for financing automobiles, home improvements, education and personal investments. Additionally, the Bank originates fixed and floating-rate mortgage loans and real estate construction and acquisition loans. Where appropriate, the Bank attempts to limit interest rate risk through the use of variable interest rates and terms of less than five years. \n \nIn general, the Bank offers the following lending services in our market areas: \n \n\uf0b7\nCommercial Business Lending.\n We make loans to small- and medium-sized businesses for purposes such as purchases of equipment, facilities upgrades, inventory acquisition and various working capital purposes. \n\uf0b7\nReal Estate Construction\n. We make commercial and residential construction and development loans. \n\uf0b7\nCommercial Real Estate Mortgage\n. We make loans to borrowers secured by commercial real estate. In underwriting \nthese\n types of loans we consider the historic and projected future cash flows of the real estate.\n\uf0b7\nResidential Mortgage.\n  We originate conforming and non-conforming closed-end residential mortgages.  These loans are secured by liens on 1 to 4 family properties.  We typically sell the conventional mortgage loans to correspondent financial institutions.  \n\n\n5\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\uf0b7\nConsumer\n. We offer various types of secured and unsecured consumer loans, including personal loans, lines of credit, \noverdraft\n lines of credit, automobile loans, installment loans, demand loans, and home equity loans. We make consumer loans primarily for personal, family or household purposes.\n \nWe sell loan participations in the ordinary course of business when a loan originated by us exceeds our legal lending limit or we otherwise want to share risk with another bank. We also purchase loan participations from time to time from other banks in the ordinary course of business.  Our loan participations are without recourse against the originating bank. Purchased loan participations are underwritten in accordance with our loan policy and represent a source of loan growth.\n \nOther Banking Services\n.  Other services offered by the Bank include safe deposit boxes, traveler\u2019s checks, direct deposit of payroll and social security checks, automatic drafts for various accounts, treasury management services and credit card merchant services. The Bank also is associated with a shared network of automated teller machines (ATMs) that may be used by Bank customers throughout Virginia, the United States, and internationally.\n \nThe Bank intends to introduce new products and services desired by the public and as permitted by the regulatory authorities. The Bank remains committed to meeting the challenges that require technology. The Bank provides its customers with access to the latest technological products, such as telephone banking and internet banking, including online bill pay. This service allows customers to handle routine transactions using a standard touch tone telephone, applications for mobile devices, and via the internet at the Bank\u2019s website.\n \nMortgage Banking.  \nThe Bank, through the Mortgage Division originates conforming and non-conforming home mortgages primarily in the Region 2000 area. Beginning in 2013 we began operating the Mortgage Division with hybrid correspondent relationships that allow the Bank to close loans in its name before an investor purchases the loan. By using the Bank\u2019s funds to close the loan (as compared to a broker relationship in which loans are funded by the purchaser of the mortgage), the Bank is able to obtain better pricing due to the slight increase in risk.  Management believes that there is acceptable risk associated with this arrangement.\n \nInvestment Advisory Services\n.  We provide investment advisory services through Financial\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, Pettyjohn, Wood & White, Inc. (\u201cPWW\u201d), a Lynchburg-based investment advisor registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Financial purchased the issued and outstanding shares of PWW on December 31, 2021.  PWW generates revenue primarily through investment advisory fees.\n \nOther Activities\n \nWe provide brokerage and investment services through the Bank\u2019s Investment division (\u201cInvestment Division\u201d). The Investment Division provides securities brokerage services to Bank customers and others through an agreement with Infinex Financial Group, LLC (\u201cInfinex\u201d), a registered broker-dealer.  Under our agreement, Infinex operates a service center at the main office located at 828 Main St, Lynchburg, Virginia.  To date the operating results of the Investment Division have not had a material impact on our financial performance.\n \nWe provide insurance and annuity products through BOTJ Insurance as an agent for national insurance companies.  As of the date hereof, we offer the following insurance products: life insurance, fixed annuities, and disability insurance.  We began providing these services in September 2008.  To date the operating results of BOTJ Insurance have not had a material impact on our financial performance.\n \n\n\n6\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\n \nEmployees \n \nAs of March\u00a029, 2022, we had approximately 158 employees, 153 of which are full-time and five of which are part-time.  None of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining agreements, and relations with employees are considered excellent. We maintain employee benefit programs that include health insurance, a health savings account, a 401(k) plan, and an employee stock purchase plan.\n \nLocation and Market Area \n \nThe Bank\u2019s market area primarily consists of Region 2000, which encompasses the seven jurisdictions of the Town of Altavista, Amherst County, Appomattox County, the Town of Bedford, Bedford County, Campbell County, and the City of Lynchburg.  Region 2000 supports a diverse, well-rounded economy. U.S. Routes 29, 60, 221, 460 and 501 and State Routes 24 and 40 all pass through the trade area and provide efficient access to other regions of the state. Regional airport service and rail service provide additional transportation channels. \n \nTotal population in the market area equals approximately 267,000. According to publically available information, the current populations of the localities in the Region 2000 market area were approximately as follows: City of Lynchburg \u2013 82,000; Amherst County \u2013 32,000; Appomattox County \u2013 15,000; Bedford County (including the Town of Bedford) \u2013 79,000; Campbell County (including the Town of Altavista) \u2013 55,000. The area is serviced by one daily newspaper and a number of radio and television stations providing diverse media outlets.  Median family income in Region 2000 has risen over the past ten years. \n \nRegion 2000 has a broad range of services, light industry, and manufacturing plants. Principal service, industrial, research and development employers include: BWX Technologies, Inc. (nuclear fuel); Framatome (nuclear services); Centra Health, Inc. (health care services); Banker Steel Company, LLC (fabricated steel); Pacific Life (life insurance and other financial products); Frito-Lay, Inc. (snack foods); Griffin Pipe Products Co. (ductile iron pipe); as well as six colleges and universities including Randolph College, Sweet Briar College, Liberty University, and the University of Lynchburg.\n \nIn recent years we have expanded into Charlottesville, Virginia (north of Region 2000), Roanoke, Virginia (west of Region 2000), Harrisonburg, Virginia (northwest of Region 2000), Appomattox (east of Region 2000), Blacksburg (southwest of Region 2000), Lexington, Virginia (northwest of Region 2000), and Rustburg, Virginia (south of Region 2000). \n \nEven with this expansion outside of Region 2000, the Bank continues to consider its primary market to be Region 2000.\n \nCompetition\n \nRetail and Commercial Banking\n \nThe banking business is highly competitive. We compete with other commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions, financial technology companies, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, and other financial institutions operating in the Region 2000 market area and elsewhere. Many of our nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive federal regulations that govern federally-insured banks and state regulations governing state-chartered banks. As a result, such nonbank competitors may have advantages over the Bank in providing certain services. \n \nVirginia law permits statewide branching by banks. Consequently, the Bank\u2019s market area is a highly competitive, highly branched banking market. Competition in the market area for loans to individuals, small \n\n\n7\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nbusinesses, and professional concerns, the Bank\u2019s target market, is keen, and pricing is important. Most of the Bank\u2019s competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than the Bank and offer certain services, such as extensive and established branch networks and trust services, that the Bank is not currently providing.  Deposit competition is strong and comes from institutions in the market, U.S. Government securities, private issuers of debt obligations and suppliers of other investment alternatives for depositors, among other sources. As a result, the Bank has paid, and may in the future pay, above-market rates to attract deposits. \n \nThe adoption of legislation permitting nationwide interstate banking and branching and the use of financial holding companies may also increase competition in the Bank\u2019s market area.  See \u201c\nSupervision and Regulation of Financial\n\u201d below. \n \nMortgage Banking\n \nThe Mortgage Division competes with large national and regional banks, credit unions, regional mortgage lenders and local mortgage brokers.  Following the 2008 downturn in the economy and subsequent real estate turmoil, the guidelines surrounding agency business (i.e., loans sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) became much more restrictive and the associated mortgage insurance for loans above 80 percent loan-to-value has continued to tighten. These changes in the conventional market have caused a dramatic increase in government lending and state bond programs.  The Mortgage Division competes by attracting the top sales people in our market, providing an operational infrastructure that manages the guideline changes efficiently and effectively, offering a product menu that is both competitive in loan parameters as well as price, and providing consistently high-quality customer service.\n \nAlthough the Mortgage Division sells loans to various intermediaries, the ability of these aggregators to purchase loans would be limited if certain government-sponsored entities (e.g. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, etc.) cease to exist or materially limit their purchases of mortgage loans.\n \nSUPERVISION AND REGULATION OF FINANCIAL\n \nGeneral\n \nFinancial, as a bank holding company, and the Bank, as a state-chartered bank, are subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations impose specific requirements or restrictions on and provide for general regulatory oversight of virtually all aspects of our operations.  The following briefly summarizes the more significant provisions of applicable federal and state laws, certain regulations and the potential impact of such provisions on Financial and the Bank.  These laws and regulations are generally intended to protect depositors, not shareholders.  The following summary is qualified by reference to the statutory and regulatory provisions discussed.  No assurance can be given that these statutes or regulations will not change.\n \nChanges in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on our business and prospects.  Our operations may be affected by legislative changes and the policies of various regulatory authorities.  We cannot predict the effect that fiscal or monetary policies, economic control, or new federal or state legislation may have on our business and earnings in the future.  \n \nRegulation of Financial\n \nGeneral\n.  Financial is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), including the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) of annual, quarterly and other reports on the financial condition and performance of the \n\n\n8\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\norganization.  Financial is directly affected by the corporate responsibility and accounting reform legislation signed into law on July\u00a030, 2002, known as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSOx Act\u201d), and the related rules and regulations.  The SOx Act includes provisions that, among other things, require that periodic reports containing financial statements that are filed with the SEC be accompanied by chief executive officer and chief financial officer certifications as to the accuracy and compliance with law, additional disclosure requirements and corporate governance and other related rules.  Although we are not required to receive an opinion from our external auditors regarding our internal controls over financial reporting under section 404 of the SOx Act because of our status as a smaller reporting company, our management\u2019s report on internal control over financial reporting is set forth in Item 9A herein.  Financial has expended considerable time and money in complying with the SOx Act and expects to continue to incur additional expenses in the future.\n \nBank Holding Company Act\n.  As a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the \u201cBHCA\u201d), Financial is subject to regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the \u201cFederal Reserve Board\u201d).  Financial is required to file with the Federal Reserve Board an annual report and such other additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require pursuant to the BHCA. \n \nThe Federal Reserve Board requires a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength and to take measures to preserve and protect its bank subsidiaries.  Financial would be compelled by the Federal Reserve Board to invest additional capital in the event the Bank experiences either significant loan losses or rapid growth of loans or deposits.\n \nThe Federal Reserve Board has jurisdiction under the BHCA to approve any bank or non-bank acquisition, merger or consolidation proposed by a bank holding company.  The BHCA, and other applicable laws and regulations, generally limit the activities of a bank holding company and its subsidiaries to that of banking, managing or controlling banks, or any other activity that is so closely related to banking or to managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.\n \nPursuant to the BHCA, the FRB has the power to order any bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the FRB has reasonable grounds to believe that continuation of such activity or ownership constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.\n \nThe FRB also has the authority to examine the Company and its subsidiaries, as well as any arrangements between the Company and its subsidiaries, with the cost of any such examinations to be borne by the Company.\u00a0 Banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies are also subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law in dealings with their holding companies and other affiliates.\n \nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999\n.  The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the \u201cGLB Act\u201d) which was effective March\u00a011, 2000, permits bank holding companies to become financial holding companies and thereby affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature.  A bank holding company may become a financial holding company by filing a declaration that the bank holding company wishes to become a financial holding company if each of its subsidiary banks (i) is well-capitalized under regulatory prompt corrective action provisions, (ii) is well managed, and (iii) has at least a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d).  No regulatory approval will be required for a financial holding company to acquire a company, other than a bank or savings association, engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the Federal Reserve Board.  \n \nThe GLB Act defines \u201cfinancial in nature\u201d to include securities underwriting, dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; merchant \n\n\n9\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nbanking activities; and activities that the Board has determined to be closely related to banking.  Subsidiary banks of a financial holding company must continue to be well-capitalized and well-managed in order to continue to engage in activities that are financial in nature without regulatory actions or restrictions, which could include divestiture of the financial in nature subsidiary or subsidiaries.  In addition, a financial holding company or a bank may not acquire a company that is engaged in activities that are financial in nature unless each of the subsidiary banks of the financial holding company or the bank has a CRA rating of satisfactory or better.  \n \nAs discussed in more detail below under \u201c\nConfidentiality and Required Disclosure of Consumer Information\n,\u201d the GLB Act also imposes customer privacy requirements on financial institutions.  \n \nThe cumulative effect of the GLB Act and other recent bank legislation has caused us to strengthen our staff to handle the procedures required by this additional regulation.  The increased staff and operational costs have impacted our profitability.  Although the above laws may have a significant impact on the banking industry by promoting, among other things, competition, it is not possible for the management of the Bank to determine, with any degree of certainty, the impact of such laws on the Bank.\n \nLimits on the Payment of Dividends\n.  Financial is a legal entity, separate and distinct from the Bank.  Financial currently does not have any significant sources of revenue other than cash dividends paid to it by the Bank.  Both Financial and the Bank are subject to laws and regulations that limit the payment of cash dividends, including requirements to maintain capital at or above regulatory minimums.  As a bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System (\u201cstate member bank\u201d), the Bank must obtain prior written approval for any cash dividend if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years. \n \nBanking regulators have indicated that Virginia banking organizations should generally pay dividends only (1) from net undivided profits of the bank, after providing for all expenses, losses, interest and taxes accrued or due by the bank and (2) if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization\u2019s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) prohibits insured depository institutions such as the Bank from making capital distributions, including the payment of dividends, if, after making such distribution, the institution would become undercapitalized as defined in the statute.  In addition, the Federal Reserve is authorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe and unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof.  The payment of dividends that deplete a bank\u2019s capital base could be deemed to constitute such an unsafe and unsound banking practice.  The Federal Reserve has indicated that banking organizations generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings.  In addition, under Virginia law, no dividend may be declared or paid out of a Virginia bank\u2019s paid-in capital.  The Bank may be prohibited under Virginia law from the payment of dividends if the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions determines that a limitation of dividends is in the public interest and is necessary to ensure the Bank\u2019s financial soundness, and may also permit the payment of dividends not otherwise allowed by Virginia law.\n \nThe Dodd-Frank Act\n \nOn July\u00a021, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Reform Act\u201d) was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Reform Act represents a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services \nindustry, although many of its provisions (e.g., the interchange and trust preferred capital limitations) apply to companies that are significantly larger than Financial. The Dodd-Frank Reform Act directs applicable regulatory authorities to promulgate regulations implementing its provisions, and its effect on Financial and on the financial services industry as a whole will be clarified as those regulations are issued.  Major elements of the Dodd-Frank Reform Act include:\n\n\n10\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\n \n \n\uf0b7\nThe \nDodd-Frank Reform Act changed the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible capital, eliminated the ceiling on the size of the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) and increased the floor applicable to the size of the DIF. The Dodd-Frank Act also made permanent the $250,000 limit for federal deposit insurance and increased the cash limit of Securities Investor Protection Corporation protection from $100,000 to $250,000.\n\uf0b7\nThe Dodd-Frank Reform Act repealed the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts.\n\uf0b7\nThe Dodd-Frank Reform Act required new disclosure relating to executive compensation and corporate governance.\n\uf0b7\nThe Dodd-Frank Reform Act implemented amendments to the Truth in Lending Act aimed at improving consumer protections with respect to mortgage originations, including originator compensation, minimum repayment standards, and prepayment considerations.\n\uf0b7\nThe Dodd-Frank Reform Act established the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which will be responsible for identifying and monitoring systemic risks posed by financial firms, activities, and practices.\n\uf0b7\nThe Dodd-Frank Reform Act amended the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) to, among other things, require that debit card interchange fees must be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction. In June 2011, the Federal Reserve Board adopted regulations setting the maximum permissible interchange fee as the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction, with an additional adjustment of up to one cent per transaction if the issuer implements additional fraud-prevention standards. Although issuers that have assets of less than $10\u00a0billion are exempt from the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s regulations that set maximum interchange fees, these regulations are expected to significantly affect the interchange fees that financial institutions with less than $10\u00a0billion in assets are able to collect.\n\uf0b7\nThe Dodd-Frank Reform Act eliminated (over time) the inclusion of trust preferred securities as a permitted element of Tier 1 capital.\n\uf0b7\nThe Dodd-Frank Reform Act created a special regime to allow for the orderly liquidation of systemically important financial companies, including the establishment of an orderly liquidation fund.\n\uf0b7\nThe Dodd-Frank Reform Act requires the development of regulations to address derivatives markets, including clearing and exchange trading requirements and a framework for regulating derivatives-market participants.\n\uf0b7\nThe Dodd-Frank Reform Act enhanced supervision of credit rating agencies through the Office of Credit Ratings within the SEC.\n\uf0b7\nThe Dodd-Frank\n Reform Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, within the Federal Reserve, to serve as a dedicated consumer-protection regulatory body.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is responsible for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws for institutions with more than $10\u00a0billion of assets and, to a lesser extent, small institutions.  As a smaller institution, most consumer protection aspects of the Dodd-Frank Reform Act will continue to be overseen by the Federal Reserve.\n\uf0b7\nThe Dodd-Frank Act allows banks to engage in de novo interstate branching, a practice that was previously significantly limited.\n \nMany aspects of the Dodd-Frank Reform Act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years.  As a result, it is difficult to anticipate the overall impact of the act on Financial.  Financial continues to evaluate the potential impact of the Dodd-Frank Reform Act.\n\n\n11\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\n \n \nIncentive Compensation\n \nIn June 2010, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d) and the FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization\u2019s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization\u2019s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization\u2019s board of directors.\n \nThe Federal Reserve will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as Financial, that are not \u201clarge, complex banking organizations.\u201d These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization\u2019s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization\u2019s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization\u2019s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization\u2019s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.\n \nThe Dodd-Frank Reform Act requires the SEC and the federal bank regulatory agencies to establish joint regulations or guidelines that require financial institutions with assets of at least $1\u00a0billion to disclose the structure of their incentive compensation practices and prohibit such institutions from maintaining compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk-taking by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to material financial loss to the financial institution.\n \nThe Regulatory Relief Act\n \nThe Regulatory Relief Act was enacted to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some of those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. While it maintains the majority of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Regulatory Relief Act amends certain aspects for small depository institutions with less than $10\u00a0billion in assets, such as the Bank. Sections in the Regulatory Relief Act address access to mortgage credit; consumer access to credit; protections for veterans, consumers, and homeowners; rules for certain bank or financial holding companies; capital access; and protections for student borrowers. Financial and the Bank will focus on the implementing rules and guidance for the various provisions in each section of the Regulatory Relief Act that impact their operations and activities.\n \nPursuant to the Regulatory Relief Act, on September\u00a017, 2019, the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule regarding a\u00a0community bank leverage ratio.\n Under the final rule, which was effective on January\u00a01, 2021, depository institutions and depository institution holding companies that have less than $10\u00a0billion in total consolidated assets and meet other qualifying criteria, including a leverage ratio (equal to Tier 1 capital divided by average total consolidated assets) of greater than 9 percent, will be eligible to opt into the community bank leverage ratio framework (qualifying community banking organizations). Qualifying community banking organizations that elect to use the community bank leverage ratio framework and that maintain a leverage ratio of greater than 9 percent will be considered to have satisfied the generally applicable risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the agencies\u2019 capital rules (generally applicable rule) and, if applicable, will be \n\n\n12\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nconsidered to have met the well-capitalized ratio requirements for purposes of section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.\n \nThe Regulatory Relief Act also expands the universe of holding companies that are permitted to rely on the \u201cSmall Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement.\u201d The asset size of a qualifying holding company was increased from $1\u00a0billion to $3\u00a0billion on August\u00a030, 2018, thus excluding holding companies in this category from consolidated capital requirements. However, subsidiary depository institutions continue to be subject to minimum capital requirements.\n \nFurther, the Regulatory Relief Act decreased the burden for community banks in regards to call reports, the Volcker Rule (which generally restricts banks from engaging in certain investment activities and limits involvement with hedge funds and private equity firms), mortgage disclosures, and risk weights for some high-risk commercial real estate loans. On December\u00a028, 2018, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule increasing the asset threshold to qualify for an 18-month examination cycle from $1\u00a0billion to $3\u00a0billion for qualifying institutions that are well capitalized, well managed and meet certain other requirements.\n \nAny number of the provisions of the Regulatory Relief Act may have the effect of increasing our expenses, decreasing our revenues, or changing the activities in which we choose to engage. The environment in which banking organizations operate, including legislative and regulatory changes affecting capital, liquidity, supervision, permissible activities, corporate governance and compensation, changes in fiscal policy and steps to eliminate government support for banking organizations, may have long-term effects on the profitability of banking organizations that cannot now be foreseen.\n \nIt is difficult at this time to determine the direct impact of the Regulatory Relief Act on Financial or the Bank. Implementing rules and regulations are required and many have not yet been written or finalized.\n \nRegulation of the Bank \n \nThe Bank is a Virginia chartered commercial bank and a state member bank.  The Bank\u2019s deposit accounts are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (\u201cDIF\u201d) of the FDIC up to the maximum legal limits of the FDIC and it is subject to regulation, supervision and regular examination by the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions and the Federal Reserve.  The regulations of these various agencies govern most aspects of the Bank\u2019s business, including required reserves against deposits, loans, investments, mergers and acquisitions, borrowings, dividends and location and number of branch offices.  The laws and regulations governing the Bank generally have been promulgated to protect depositors and the deposit insurance funds, and not for the purpose of protecting shareholders. \n \nGeneral\n.  As a state-chartered commercial bank, the Bank and its subsidiaries are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve and the Virginia State Corporation Commission\u2019s Bureau of Financial Institutions (the \u201cBFI\u201d). As such, the Bank is subject to various statutes and regulations administered by these agencies that govern, among other things, required reserves, investments, loans, lending limits, acquisitions of fixed assets, interest rates payable on deposits, transactions among affiliates and the Bank, the payment of dividends, mergers and consolidations, and establishment of branch offices.  \n \nThe earnings of the Bank are affected by general economic conditions, management policies and the legislative and governmental actions of the various regulatory authorities, including those referred to above.  \n \nFDIC Insurance Premiums. \n The FDIC's DIF provides insurance coverage for certain deposits, which insurance is funded through assessments on banks, like the Bank. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the amount of deposit insurance coverage for deposits increased to $250,000 per depositor, subject to aggregation rules.  Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), the \n\n\n13\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nFDIC has established 2.0% as the designated reserve ratio (the \u201cDRR\u201d), that is, the ratio of the DIF to insured deposits. The Dodd-Frank Act directs the FDIC to amend its assessment regulations so that future assessments will generally be based upon a depository institution's average total consolidated assets minus the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period, whereas assessments were previously based on the amount of an institution's insured deposits. The minimum DIF rate has increased from 1.15% to 1.35%, and the cost of the increase will be borne by depository institutions with assets of $10\u00a0billion or more. At least semi-annually, the FDIC will update its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, will increase or decrease assessment rates, following notice-and-comment rule making if required.\n \nIn 2021, the Bank expensed $548,000 in FDIC assessments which compared to $336,000 in 2020.  Any increases in FDIC insurance premiums could adversely affect the Bank\u2019s profitability.\n \nAfter giving primary regulators an opportunity to first take action, FDIC may initiate an enforcement action against any depository institution it determines is engaging in unsafe or unsound actions or which is in an unsound condition, and the FDIC may terminate that institution\u2019s deposit insurance.\n \nCapital Requirements\n. On June\u00a07, 2012, the Federal Reserve issued a series of proposed rules that would revise and strengthen its risk-based and leverage capital requirements and its method for calculating risk-weighted assets. The rules were proposed to implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Reform Act. On July\u00a02, 2013, the Federal Reserve approved certain revisions to the proposals and finalized new capital requirements for banking organizations.\n \nEffective January\u00a01, 2015, the final rules required the Bank to comply with the following new minimum capital ratios: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets (increased from the previous requirement of 4.0%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets (unchanged from the previous requirement); and (iv) a leverage ratio of 4.0% of total assets. These were the initial capital requirements, which were phased in over a five-year period.  As fully phased in on January\u00a01, 2019, the rules require the Bank to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d (which is added to the 4.5% common equity Tier 1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0% upon full implementation), (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation), (iii) a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation), and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets.\n \nThe capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning January\u00a01, 2016, at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets, increasing each year until  it was fully implemented at 2.5% on January\u00a01, 2019. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.\n \nWith respect to the Bank, the rules also revised the \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the FDIA by (i) introducing a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio requirement at each level (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the minimum ratio for well-capitalized status being 8.0% (as compared to the previous 6.0%); and (iii) eliminating the current provision that provides \n\n\n14\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nthat a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3.0% Tier 1 leverage ratio and still be well-capitalized.\n \nThe capital requirements also included changes in the risk weights of assets to better reflect credit risk and other risk exposures. These included a 150% risk weight (up from 100%) for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and nonresidential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise on non-accrual status, a 20% (up from 0%) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable, a 250% risk weight (up from 100%) for mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital, and increased risk-weights (from 0% to up to 600%) for equity exposures.\n \nAs discussed above under \u201c\nSupervision and Regulation - The Regulatory Relief Ac\nt\n,\u201d recently enacted legislation directs the federal bank regulatory agencies to develop a \u201cCommunity Bank Leverage Ratio,\u201d calculated by dividing tangible equity capital by average consolidated total assets, of not less than 8% and not more than 10%. \nOn September\u00a017, 2019, pursuant to the Regulatory Relief Act, the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule setting a community bank leverage ratio\u00a0of 9%. \nIf a \u201cqualified community bank,\u201d generally a depository institution or depository institution holding company with consolidated assets of less than $10\u00a0billion, has a leverage ratio which exceeds the\u00a0Community Bank Leverage Ratio, then such bank will be considered to have met all generally applicable leverage and risk based capital requirements; the capital ratio requirements for \u201cwell capitalized\u201d status under Section\u00a038 of the FDIA, and any other leverage or capital requirements to which it is subject.  \nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory authorities lowered the tier 1 leverage ratio required under the community bank leverage ratio framework to 8.5% and 8.0% for 2021 and 2020, respectively.  The Community Bank Leverage Ratio returned to 9% on January 1, 2022.\n \nThe asset size of a qualifying holding company was increased from $1\u00a0billion to $3\u00a0billion on August\u00a030, 2018, thus excluding holding companies in this category from consolidated capital requirements.\n \nBecause total assets on a consolidated basis are less than $3\u00a0billion, Financial is not subject to the consolidated capital requirements imposed by the Bank Holding Company Act.  Although the Company\u2019s \nsubsidiary depository institution continues to be subject to minimum capital requirement, \nit is unlikely that the Company will be required to comply with the consolidated capital rules until well into the future.\n \nTransactions with Affiliates\n.  The Bank is subject to the provisions of Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve Regulation W of the Federal Reserve Bank which place limits on the amount of loans or extensions of credit to affiliates (as defined in the Federal Reserve Act), investments in or certain other transactions with affiliates and on the amount of advances to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates.  The law and regulation limit the aggregate amount of transactions with any individual affiliate to ten percent (10%) of the capital and surplus of the Bank and also limit the aggregate amount of transactions with all affiliates to twenty percent (20%) of capital and surplus.  Loans and certain other extensions of credit to affiliates are required to be secured by collateral in an amount and of a type described in the regulation, and the purchase of low-quality assets from affiliates is generally prohibited.  The law and Regulation W also, among other things, prohibit an institution from engaging in certain transactions with certain affiliates (as defined in the Federal Reserve Act) unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to such institution and/or its subsidiaries, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated entities.  In the absence of comparable transactions, such transactions may only occur under terms and circumstances, including credit standards that in good faith would be offered to or would apply to non-affiliated companies.\n \nLoans to Insiders.  \nThe Bank is subject to the restrictions contained in Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Regulation O thereunder on loans to executive officers, directors and principal stockholders.  Under Section 22(h), loans to a director, an executive officer or a greater-than-10% \n\n\n15\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nstockholder of a bank as well as certain affiliated interests of any of the foregoing may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests, the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to national banks (generally 15% of the institution\u2019s unimpaired capital and surplus), and all loans to all such persons in the aggregate may not exceed the institution\u2019s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus.  Regulation O also prohibits the making of loans in an amount greater than $25,000 or 5% of capital and surplus but in any event not over $500,000, to directors, executive officers and greater-than-10% stockholders of a bank, and their respective affiliates, unless such loans are approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the bank with any \u201cinterested\u201d director not participating in the voting.  Furthermore, Regulation O requires that loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders of a bank be made on terms substantially the same as those that are offered in comparable transactions to unrelated third parties unless the loans are made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to all employees of the bank and does not give preference to insiders over other employees.  Regulation O also prohibits a depository institution from paying overdrafts over $1,000 of any of its executive officers or directors unless they are paid pursuant to written pre-authorized extension of credit or transfer of funds plans.\n \nAll of the Bank\u2019s loans to its and the Company\u2019s executive officers, directors and greater-than-10% stockholders, and affiliated interests of such persons, comply with the requirements of Regulation W and Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O. \n \nCommunity Reinvestment Act.  \nThe Community Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within their respective jurisdictions, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or the Office of Thrift Supervision shall evaluate the record of the financial institutions in meeting the credit needs of their local communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions.  The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution\u2019s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA.  An institution\u2019s CRA activities are considered in, among other things, evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility, as well as determining whether the institution will be permitted to exercise certain of the powers allowed by the GLB Act.  The CRA also requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their CRA ratings.  The Bank currently has a CRA rating of \u201csatisfactory.\u201d\n \nSafety and Soundness\n.  The federal banking agencies have broad powers under current federal law to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems of insured depository institutions.  The extent of these powers depends upon whether the institutions in question are \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d \u201cadequately capitalized,\u201d \u201cundercapitalized,\u201d \u201csignificantly undercapitalized,\u201d or \u201ccritically undercapitalized,\u201d all such terms are defined under uniform regulations defining such capital levels issued by each of the federal banking agencies.  An insured depository institution which is less than adequately capitalized must adopt an acceptable capital restoration plan, is subject to increased regulatory oversight and is increasingly restricted in the scope of its permissible activities.  As of December\u00a031, 2021, the Bank was considered \u201cwell-capitalized.\u201d\n \nRegulatory Enforcement Authority\n.  Applicable banking laws include substantial enforcement powers available to federal banking regulators.  This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease-and-desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties.  In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices.  Other actions or inactions, including the filing of misleading or untimely reports with regulatory authorities, may provide the basis for enforcement action.  \n \nConfidentiality and Required Disclosures of Consumer Information\n.\u00a0The Bank is subject to various laws and regulations that address the privacy of nonpublic personal financial information of consumers. The Gramm-\n\n\n16\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nLeach-Bliley Act and certain regulations issued thereunder protect against the transfer and use by financial institutions of consumer nonpublic personal information. A financial institution must provide to its customers, at the beginning of the customer relationship and annually thereafter, the institution\u2019s policies and procedures regarding the handling of customers\u2019 nonpublic personal financial information. These privacy provisions generally prohibit a financial institution from providing a customer\u2019s personal financial information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution discloses to the customer that the information may be so provided and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure.\u00a0 \n \nIn August, 2018, the CFPB published its final rule to update Regulation P pursuant to the amended GLB Act.  Under this rule, certain qualifying financial institutions are not required to provide annual privacy notices to customers.  To qualify, a financial institution must not share nonpublic personal information about customers except as described in certain statutory exceptions which do not trigger a customer\u2019s statutory opt-out.  In addition, the financial institution must not have changed its disclosure policies and practices from those disclosed in its most recent privacy notice.  The rule sets forth timing requirements for delivery of annual privacy notices in the event that a financial institution that qualified for the annual notice exemption later changes its policies or practices in such a way that it no longer qualifies for the exemption.\n \nThe Bank is also subject to various laws and regulations that attempt to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The Bank Secrecy Act requires all financial institutions to, among other things, create a system of controls designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and imposes recordkeeping and reporting requirements. The USA Patriot Act facilitates information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering, and requires financial institutions to establish anti-money laundering programs. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d), which is a division of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, is responsible for helping to ensure that United States entities do not engage in transactions with \u201cenemies\u201d of the United States, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. If the Bank finds a name of an \u201cenemy\u201d of the United States on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, it must freeze such account or place transferred funds into a blocked account, file a suspicious activity report with the Treasury and notify the FBI.\n \nMortgage Banking Regulation\n.  The Bank\u2019s Mortgage Division is subject to the rules and regulations by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d), the Federal Housing Administration (the \u201cFHA\u201d), the Department of Veteran Affairs and state regulatory authorities with respect to originating, processing, servicing and selling mortgage loans.  Those rules and regulations, among other things, establish standards for loan origination, prohibit discrimination, provide for inspections and appraisals of property, require credit reports on prospective borrowers and, in some cases, restrict certain loan features, and fix maximum interest rates and fees.  In addition to other federal laws, mortgage origination activities are subject to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth-in-Lending Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and the Home Ownership Equity Protection Act, and the regulations promulgated thereunder.  These laws prohibit discrimination, require the disclosure of certain basic information to mortgagors concerning credit and settlement costs, limit payment for settlement services to the reasonable value of the services rendered and require the maintenance and disclosure of information regarding the disposition of mortgage applications based on race, gender, geographical distribution and income level.  \n \nEffect of Governmental Monetary Policies\n \nOur earnings are affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies.  The Federal Reserve Bank\u2019s monetary policies have had, and are likely to continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of commercial banks through its power to implement national monetary policy in order, among other things, to curb inflation or combat a recession.  The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board have major effects upon the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through its open market operations in United States government securities and through \n\n\n17\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nits regulation of the discount rate on borrowings of member banks and the reserve requirements against member bank deposits.  It is not possible to predict the nature or impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies.\n \nFuture Regulatory Uncertainty\n \nLegislative and regulatory proposals regarding changes in banking, and the regulation of banks, federal savings institutions, and other financial institutions and bank and bank holding company powers are being considered by the executive branch of the federal government, Congress and various state governments.  Certain of these proposals, if adopted, could significantly change the regulation or operations of banks and the financial services industry.  New regulations and statutes are regularly proposed that contain wide-ranging proposals for altering the structures, regulations, and competitive relationships of the nation\u2019s financial institutions.\n \nBecause federal regulation of financial institutions changes regularly and is the subject of constant legislative debate, we cannot forecast how federal regulation of financial institutions may change in the future and impact our operations.  The recent economic environment has required a greater degree of coordination and overlap of the duties and responsibilities of the U.S. Treasury, federal and state banking regulators and the FDIC.  We fully expect that the financial institution industry will remain heavily regulated in the near future and that additional laws or regulations may be adopted further regulating specific banking practices.  We cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed regulation or statute will be adopted or the extent to which our business may be affected by any new regulation or statute.\n ", "item1a": ">Item 1A.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Risk Factors\n \nRISK FACTORS\n \nIn addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in connection with evaluating our business and any forward-looking statements contained herein.  \nOur business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed by any of the risk factors described below, or other risks that have not been identified or which we believe are immaterial or unlikely.  If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\n \nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\n \nOur profitability depends significantly on local economic conditions.\n \nOur success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the primary markets in Virginia in which we operate and where our loans are concentrated. Unlike nationwide banks that are more geographically diversified, the Company provides banking and financial services to customers primarily in the Lynchburg metropolitan statistical area (\u201cMSA\u201d).  Lynchburg\u2019s MSA, which is often referred to as Region 2000, consists of approximately 2,122 square miles, and includes the City of Lynchburg and the Counties of Bedford, Campbell, Amherst and Appomattox.  To a lesser extent, our lending market includes the Roanoke, Charlottesville and Harrisonburg MSAs.  Our branches in localities outside of Region 2000 have a short operating history.  As of December 2021, the Lynchburg MSA had an unemployment rate (seasonally adjusted) of 2.7%, as compared to a statewide average unemployment rate of 3.3%.  \n \nThe local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s commercial and industrial, real estate and construction loans, the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans and the value of \n\n\n18\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nthe collateral securing these loans.  In addition, if the population or income growth in the Company\u2019s market areas is slower than projected, income levels, deposits and housing starts could be adversely affected and could result in a reduction of the Company\u2019s expansion, growth and profitability.  If the Company\u2019s market areas experience a downturn or a recession for a prolonged period of time, the Company could experience significant increases in nonperforming loans, which could lead to operating losses, impaired liquidity and eroding capital.  A significant decline in general economic conditions, caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, outbreaks of hostilities or other international or domestic calamities, unemployment, monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and could negatively affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n \nThe \nCompany\u2019s\n business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0pandemic\n.\n \nThe\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0pandemic negatively impacted the local, state, national, and world economies. The pandemic created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected, and have the potential to continue to adversely affect, the Company's business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. The extent to which the\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0pandemic will continue to negatively affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the continued effectiveness of the Company's business continuity plan, the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on the Company's employees, customers, clients, and service providers, as well as other market participants, and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.\n \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to or resulted in:\n \n\uf0b7\nEmployment shortages and decreased consumer confidence and business generally.\n\uf0b7\nTemporary closures of many businesses and the institution of social distancing or other measurements.\n\uf0b7\nRatings downgrades, credit deterioration and some defaults in several industries, including natural resources, hospitality, transportation and commercial real estate.\n\uf0b7\nVolatility in the rates and yields on U.S. Treasury securities.\n\uf0b7\nUnpredictable demands on capital and liquidity.\n\uf0b7\nHeightened cybersecurity, information security and operational risks as a result of work-from-home arrangements\n.\n \nAs a result:\n \n\uf0b7\nThe \ndemand for our products and services could be significantly impacted, which could decrease our net interest income and adversely affect our revenue and net income.\n\uf0b7\nWe could have an increase in customer delinquencies and loan defaults, including defaults on unsecured loans, and further increases in our allowance for loan losses and foreclosures.\n\uf0b7\nThe decline in rates and yields has had a negative effect on our yields on assets which has compressed our net interest margin.\n \nGovernmental authorities took unprecedented measures to provide economic assistance to individual households and businesses, stabilize the markets and support economic growth. The consequences of these measures may not be sufficient to fully mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company also faces an increase in governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of COVID-19 on market and economic conditions and actions governmental authorities take in response to those conditions.\n \n\n\n19\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\n \nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business, results of operation, and financial condition, as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and the actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.\n \nThe length of the pandemic and the long term consequences of the extraordinary measures being put in place to address it are unknown. Even after the pandemic subsides, the U.S. economy may experience a recession, and the Company anticipates the Company's businesses would be materially and adversely affected by a prolonged recession. To the extent the pandemic adversely affects the Company's business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the section\n.\n \nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and events that negatively impact the real estate market could hurt our business.\n \nA substantial majority of our loans have real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral.  The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended.  Because most of our loans are concentrated in the Region 2000 area in and surrounding the City of Lynchburg, a decline in local economic conditions may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of larger financial institutions whose real estate loan portfolios are more geographically diverse.  A weakening of the real estate market in our primary market areas could result in an increase in the number of borrowers who default on their loans and a reduction in the value of the collateral securing their loans, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our profitability and asset quality.  If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, our earnings and capital could be adversely affected.  Additionally, acts of nature, including hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes, fires and floods, which may cause uninsured damage and other loss of value to real estate that secures these loans, may also negatively impact our financial condition.\n \nOur loan portfolio contains a number of real estate loans with relatively large balances.\n \nA significant portion of our total loan portfolio contains real estate loans with balances in excess of $1,000,000.  The deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans, which could result in a net loss of earnings, an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in loan charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. \n \nCommercial\n real estate loans increase our exposure to credit risk.\n \nA majority of our loan portfolio is secured by commercial real estate.  Loans secured by commercial real estate are generally viewed as having more risk of default than loans secured by residential real estate or consumer loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property, the income stream of the borrowers, the accuracy of the estimate of the property\u2019s value at completion of construction and the estimated cost of construction.  An adverse development with respect to one lending relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss as compared with a single-family residential mortgage loan because we typically have more than one loan with such borrowers. Additionally, these loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared with single-family residential mortgage loans.  Therefore, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant decline in the related asset quality.  These loans represent higher risk and could result in a sharp increase in loans charged-off and could require us to significantly increase our allowance for loan losses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n\n20\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\n \n \nA \npercentage\n of the loans in our portfolio currently include exceptions to our loan policies and supervisory guidelines.\n \nAll of the loans that we make are subject to written loan policies adopted by our board of directors and to supervisory guidelines imposed by our regulators.  Our loan policies are designed to reduce the risks associated with the loans that we make by requiring our loan officers to take certain steps that vary depending on the type and amount of the loan, prior to closing a loan.  These steps include, among other things, making sure the proper liens are documented and perfected on property securing a loan, and requiring proof of adequate insurance coverage on property securing loans.  Loans that do not fully comply with our loan policies are known as \u201cexceptions.\u201d  We categorize exceptions as policy exceptions, financial statement exceptions and document exceptions.  As a result of these exceptions, such loans may have a higher risk of loan loss than the other loans in our portfolio that fully comply with our loan policies.  In addition, we may be subject to regulatory action by federal or state banking authorities if they believe the number of exceptions in our loan portfolio represents an unsafe banking practice.\n \n \nAs\n a community bank, we have different lending risks than larger banks. We provide services to individuals and\n small to medium-sized businesses in our local markets who may have fewer financial resources to weather a downturn in the economy\n. \n \nOur ability to diversify our economic risks is limited by our own local markets and economies. We lend primarily to small to medium-sized businesses, professionals and individuals, which may expose us to greater lending risks than those of banks lending to larger, better-capitalized businesses with longer operating histories.  For instance, small to medium-sized businesses frequently have smaller market share than their competition, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities, often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience significant volatility in operating results.  Any one or more of these factors may impair the borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan.  In addition, the success of a small to medium-sized business often depends on the management talents and efforts of one or two persons or a small group of persons, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay a loan. Economic downturns and other events that negatively impact the Company\u2019s market areas could cause the Company to incur substantial credit losses that could negatively affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n \nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties, and our financial condition could be adversely affected if we rely on misleading information.\n \nIn deciding whether to extend credit or to enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information, which we do not independently verify as a matter of course.  We also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors.  For example, in deciding whether to extend credit to customers, we may assume that a customer\u2019s audited financial statements conform with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. Our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent we rely on financial statements that do not comply with GAAP or are materially misleading.\n \n\n\n21\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\n \nIf we suffer loan losses from a decline in credit quality, our earnings will decrease. \n \nWe could sustain losses if borrowers, guarantors or related parties fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans.  We have adopted underwriting and credit monitoring procedures and policies, including the establishment and review of the allowance for loan losses, that we believe are appropriate to minimize this risk by assessing the likelihood of nonperformance, tracking loan performance and diversifying our credit portfolio.  These policies and procedures, however, may not prevent unexpected losses that could materially adversely affect our results of operations. \n \nThese policies and procedures necessarily rely on our making various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans.  In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate economic conditions.  If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance.  Any future additions to our allowance could materially decrease our net income.\n \nIn addition, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions (the \u201cBFI\u201d) periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs.  Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by regulatory authorities might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n \nOur allowance \nmay\n not be adequate to cover actual loan losses.\n \nA significant source of risk arises from the possibility that we could sustain losses due to loan defaults and nonperformance on loans. We maintain an allowance in accordance with GAAP to provide for such defaults and other nonperformance. As of December\u00a031, 2021, our allowance as a percentage of total loans was 1.19% and our allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans was 724.84%. The determination of the appropriate level of allowance is an inherently difficult process and is based on numerous assumptions. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, our underwriting policies, adherence to credit monitoring processes and risk management systems and controls may not prevent unexpected losses. Our allowance may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses. Moreover, any increase in our allowance will adversely affect our earnings by decreasing our net income.\n \nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board decided to change how banks estimate losses in the allowance calculation, and it issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses. Currently, the impairment model is based on incurred losses, and loans are recognized as impaired when there is no longer an assumption that future cash flows will be collected in full under the originally contracted terms. This model will be replaced by the new Current Expected Credit Losses (\u201cCECL\u201d) model that will become effective for us, as a smaller reporting company, for the first interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December\u00a015, 2022. Under the new CECL model, we will be required to use historical information, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts to estimate the expected loss over the life of the loan. The transition to the CECL model will bring with it significantly greater data requirements and changes to methodologies to accurately account for expected losses under the new parameters.\n \nManagement is currently evaluating the impact of these changes to our financial position and results of operations. The allowance is a material estimate of ours, and given the change from an incurred loss model to a methodology that considers the credit loss over the life of the loan, there is the potential for an increase in the allowance at adoption date. We anticipate a significant change in the processes and procedures to calculate the \n\n\n22\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nallowance, including changes in assumptions and estimates to consider expected credit losses over the life of the loan versus the current accounting practice that utilizes the incurred loss model. We expect to continue developing and implementing processes and procedures to ensure we are fully compliant with the CECL requirements at its adoption date.\n \nThe \nmarkets\n for our deposit and lending products and services are highly competitive, and we face substantial competition. \n \nThe banking and financial services industry is highly competitive.  We compete as a financial intermediary with other commercial banks, savings banks, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies and brokerage and investment banking firms soliciting business from residents of and businesses located in the Virginia localities where the Bank has a presence, surrounding areas and elsewhere.  Many of these competing institutions have nationwide or regional operations and have greater resources than we have.  We also face competition from local community institutions.  Many of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages, including greater name recognition, financial resources, a wider geographic presence or more accessible branch office locations, the ability to offer additional services, greater marketing resources, more favorable pricing alternatives for loans and deposits and lower origination and operating costs. We are also subject to lower lending limits than our larger competitors.  Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market areas.  Increased deposit competition could increase our cost of funds and could adversely affect our ability to generate the funds necessary for our lending operations.  If we must raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on our loans, our net interest margin and profitability could be adversely affected. Competition could result in a decrease in loans we originate and could negatively affect our ability to grow and our results of operations. \n \nTechnology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems.  Many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures.  Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services.\n \nWe have increased and plan to continue to increase our levels of commercial and industrial loans.  We may not be successful in continuing to penetrate this market segment, which has helped to drive some of our recent earnings.  \n \nA significant percentage of our loans are commercial and industrial loans.  Our portfolio of commercial and industrial loans has increased during the past year.  \n \nWhile we intend to originate these types of loans in a manner that is consistent with safety and soundness, these non-residential loans generally expose us to greater risk of loss than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, as repayment of such commercial and industrial loans generally depends, in large part, on the borrower\u2019s business to cover operating expenses and debt service.  In addition, these types of loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers, as compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans.  Changes in economic conditions that are beyond our or the borrower\u2019s control could adversely affect the value of the security for the loan, including the future cash flow of the affected business.  As we increase our portfolio of these loans, we may experience higher levels of non-performing assets or loan losses\n, or both\n.\n \n\n\n23\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\n \nOur\n plans for future expansion depend, in some instances, on factors beyond our control, and an unsuccessful attempt to achieve growth could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. \n \nWe expect to continue to engage in new branch expansion in the future.  We may also seek to acquire other financial institutions, or parts of those institutions, though we have no present plans in that regard.  Expansion involves a number of risks, including, without limitation:\n \n\uf0b7\nthe time and costs of evaluating new markets, hiring experienced local management and opening new offices;  \n\uf0b7\nthe time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion;  \n\uf0b7\nour entrance into new markets where we lack experience;\n\uf0b7\nthe introduction of new products and services with which we have no prior experience into our business;\n\uf0b7\nfailure to culturally integrate an acquisition target or new branches or failing to identify and select the optimal candidate for integration or expansion; and\n\uf0b7\nfailure to identify and retain experienced key management members with local expertise and relationships in new markets.\n \nWe \nmay\n acquire and hold other real estate owned (OREO) properties, which could lead to increased operating expenses and vulnerability to declines in the market value of real estate in our areas of operations. \n \nFrom time-to-time, we foreclose upon and take title to the real estate serving as collateral for our loans as part of our business.  If our OREO balance increases, management expects that our earnings will be negatively affected by various expenses associated with OREO, including personnel costs, insurance and taxes, completion and repair costs, valuation adjustments and other expenses associated with property ownership.  Also, at the time that we foreclose upon a loan and take possession of a property, we estimate the value of that property using third-party appraisals and opinions and internal judgments.  OREO property is valued on our books at the estimated market value of the property, less the estimated costs to sell (or \u201cfair value\u201d). Upon foreclosure, a charge-off to the allowance for loan losses is recorded for any excess between the value of the asset on our books over its fair value.  Thereafter, we periodically reassess our judgment of fair value based on updated appraisals or other factors, including, at times, at the request of our regulators.  Any declines in our estimate of fair value for OREO will result in valuation adjustments, with a corresponding expense in our consolidated statements of income that is recorded under the line item for \u201cOther real estate expenses.\u201d  As a result, our results of operations are vulnerable to declines in the market for residential and commercial real estate in the areas in which we operate.  The expenses associated with OREO and  property write downs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  Any increase in non-accrual loans may lead to increases in our OREO balance in the future. \n \nAdditional\n growth and regulatory requirements may require us to raise additional capital in the future, and capital may not be available when it is needed or may have unfavorable terms, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. \n \nWe are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations.  While the boards of the Company and the Bank intend to take steps to ensure that the capital plan aligns with the Bank\u2019s strategic plan, that all material risks to the Bank are identified and measured and that capital limits are appropriate for the institution\u2019s risk profile, failure to successfully implement such steps could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  We may at some point need to raise additional capital to support our continued growth.  Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and on \n\n\n24\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nour financial performance.  Accordingly, we can make no assurances of our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, on terms acceptable to us.  If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations could be materially impaired. \n \nOur\n corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the teamwork and increased productivity fostered by our culture, which could harm our business. \n \nWe believe that a critical contributor to our success has been our corporate culture, which we believe fosters teamwork and increased productivity.  As our organization grows and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture.  This could negatively impact our future success. \n \nIf we \nfail\n to retain our key employees, our growth and profitability could be adversely affected. \n \nOur success is, and is expected to remain, highly dependent on our executive management team.  We are especially dependent on these executives as well as other key personnel because, as a community bank, we depend on our management team\u2019s ties to the community to generate business for us, and our executives have key expertise needed to implement our business strategy.  Our executive management and other key personnel have not signed non-competition covenants.  \n \nCompetition for personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel.  Our failure to compete for these personnel, or the loss of the services of several of such key personnel, could adversely affect our growth strategy and seriously harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n \nSevere weather, natural disasters, widespread disease or pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), acts of war or terrorism or other adverse external events could significantly impact our business.\n \nSevere weather, natural disasters, widespread disease or pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), acts of war or terrorism or other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. In addition, such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue or cause us to incur additional expenses. The occurrence of any of these events in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n \nAs a \ncommunity\n bank, our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business, and our failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\n \n \nAs a community bank, our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business.  As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers and associates.  Negative publicity can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance, acquisitions and actions taken or threatened by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities.  If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees or otherwise, there may be an adverse effect on our ability to keep and attract customers, and we might be exposed to litigation and regulatory action.  Any of such events could harm our business, and, therefore, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.  As a financial services company with a high profile in our market area, we are inherently exposed to this risk.  While we take steps to minimize reputation risk in dealing with customers and other constituencies, we will continue to face additional \n\n\n25\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nchallenges maintaining our reputation with respect to customers of the Bank in our current primary market area in Region 2000 and in establishing our reputation in new market areas.\n \nOur decisions regarding how we manage our credit exposure may materially and adversely affect our business.\n \nWe manage our credit exposure through careful monitoring of lending relationships and loan concentrations in particular industries, and through loan approval and review procedures. \n \nWe have established an evaluation process designed to determine the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses.  While this evaluation process uses historical and other objective information, the classification of loans and the establishment of loan losses is an estimate based on experience, judgment and expectations regarding our borrowers and the economies in which we and our borrowers operate, as well as the judgment of our regulators.  While our board and senior management are continuing to improve the Bank\u2019s risk management framework and align the Bank\u2019s risk philosophy with its capital and strategic plans, failure to continue to improve such risk management framework could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  We can make no assurances that our loan loss reserves will be sufficient to absorb future loan losses or prevent a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. \n \nOur profitability is vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations and changes in monetary policies. \n \nOur profitability depends substantially upon our net interest income.  Net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and the interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as NOW accounts, savings accounts, time deposits and other borrowings.  Market interest rates for loans, investments and deposits are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control.  Interest rate spreads have seen a sustained period of narrowness due to many factors, such as market conditions, policies of various government and regulatory authorities and competitive pricing pressures, and we cannot predict whether these rate spreads will narrow further.  This narrowing of interest rate spreads could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, we cannot predict whether interest rates will continue to remain at present levels. Changes in interest rates may cause significant changes, up or down, in our net interest income. Depending on our portfolio of loans and investments, our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates.  \n \nOur financial condition and results of operations are affected by credit policies of monetary authorities, particularly the Federal Reserve Board. Actions by monetary and fiscal authorities, including the Federal Reserve Board, could have an adverse effect on our deposit levels, loan demand or business and earnings.  \n \nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt our business, result \nin\n the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.\n \nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer-relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems.  While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur; or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed.  The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could disrupt our business, increase our costs, result in the disclosure of confidential client information, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, \n\n\n26\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nsubject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability; any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  \n \nOur computer systems, software and networks have been and will continue to be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber-attacks and other events.  These threats may derive from human error, fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties, or may result from accidental technological failure.  Information security risks for financial institutions such as ours have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and digital technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists and other external parties. Some of our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks. Our business relies on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software and networks to conduct its operations. In addition, to access our products and services, our customers may use personal smartphones, tablets, personal computers and other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems. Although we have information security procedures and controls in place, our technologies, systems, networks and our customers\u2019 devices may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our customers\u2019 confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt our or our customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 business operations.\u00a0\n \nAlthough we maintain safeguards to protect against these risks, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer losses in the future that may be material in amount or nature.\n \nChanges in consumers\u2019 use of banks and changes in consumers\u2019 spending and saving habits could adversely affect our financial results.\n \nTechnology and other changes now allow many consumers to complete financial transactions without using banks.  For example, consumers can pay bills and transfer funds directly without going through a bank.  This disintermediation could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and income generated from those deposits.  In addition, changes in consumer spending and saving habits could adversely affect our operations, and we may be unable to timely develop competitive new products and services in response to these changes that are accepted by new and existing customers.\n \nFailure \nto\n implement new technologies in our operations may adversely affect our growth or profits.\n \nThe market for financial services, including banking services and consumer finance services, is increasingly affected by advances in technology, including developments in telecommunications, data processing, computers, automation, Internet-based banking and telebanking.  Our ability to compete successfully in our markets may depend on the extent to which we are able to exploit such technological changes.  However, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to properly or timely anticipate or implement such technologies or properly train our staff to use such technologies.  Any failure to adapt to new technologies could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.\n \nIn addition, the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with new technology-driven products and services being frequently introduced.\u00a0 The changes could cause our customers to use these new services and products rather than the Bank.\u00a0 For example, financial technology (or \u201cfintech\u201d) companies that rely on technology to provide financial services such as peer-to-peer platforms, blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies have the potential to disrupt the financial services industry and change the way banks do business.\u00a0 Fintech companies are subject to limited regulation.\u00a0 We may not be able to effectively \n\n\n27\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nimplement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in competing against products, which could impair our growth and profitability. \n \nWe are \nsubject\n to operational risks.\n \nThe Company may also be subject to disruptions of its systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control (including, for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages), which may give rise to losses in service to customers and to financial loss or liability.  The Company is further exposed to the risk that its external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as is the Company) and to the risk that the Company\u2019s (or its vendors\u2019) business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate.\n \nWe are \nsubject\n to liquidity risk.\n \nLiquidity risk is the potential that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they become due, capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise or pay regular cash dividends because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding in a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances.  A failure to adequately manage our liquidity risk could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results, especially in the event of another financial crisis.  Further, the Federal Reserve could impose additional requirements on the Company if the agency determines that our enhanced liquidity risk management practices do not adequately manage our liquidity risk.\n \nWe may \nlose\n lower-cost funding sources.\n \nChecking, savings and money market deposit account balances and other forms of customer deposits can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff.  If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments, the Bank could lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, thereby increasing its funding costs and reducing the Bank\u2019s net interest income and net income.\n \nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal and disclosure controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent or detect fraud.\n \nEffective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent or detect fraud and to operate successfully as a public company.  \n \nThe Company faces the risk that the design of its controls and procedures, including those to mitigate the risk of fraud by employees or outsiders, may prove to be inadequate or are circumvented, thereby causing delays in detection of errors or inaccuracies in data and information.  We regularly review and update the Company\u2019s internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures.  Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met.  Any failure or circumvention of the Company\u2019s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. \n \nAny failure to maintain effective controls or timely effect any necessary improvement of our internal and disclosure controls could hinder our ability to accurately report our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, which could affect our ability to remain listed with The NASDAQ Capital \n\n\n28\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nMarket.  Ineffective internal and disclosure controls could also harm our reputation, negatively impact our operating results or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which likely would have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities.\n \nChanges in the financial markets could impair the value of our investment portfolio.\n \nOur investment securities portfolio is a significant component of our total earning assets.  Turmoil in the financial markets could impair the market value of our investment portfolio, which could adversely affect our net income and possibly our capital.\n \nFrom time to time, we hold as investments certain securities that have unrealized losses.  While we currently maintain substantial liquidity which supports our intent and ability to hold these investments until they mature, or until there is a market price recovery, if we were to cease to have the ability and intent to hold these investments until maturity or if the market prices do not recover, and we were to sell these securities at a loss, it could adversely affect our net income and possibly our capital.\n \nOur deposit insurance premiums could be substantially higher in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our future earnings.\n \nThe FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, up to applicable limits.  The amount of a particular institution\u2019s deposit insurance assessment is based on that institution\u2019s risk classification under an FDIC risk-based assessment system.  An institution\u2019s risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to its regulators.  Bank failures significantly depleted the FDIC\u2019s Deposit Insurance Fund and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits.  As a result of recent economic conditions and the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Reform Act, banks are now assessed deposit insurance premiums based on the bank\u2019s average consolidated total assets, and the FDIC has modified certain risk-based adjustments, which increase or decrease a bank\u2019s overall assessment rate.  This has resulted in increases to the deposit insurance assessment rates, and thus raised deposit premiums for many insured depository institutions.  If these increases are insufficient for the Deposit Insurance Fund to meet its funding requirements, further special assessments or increases in deposit insurance premiums may be required.  We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance.  If there are additional bank or financial institution failures, we may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums than the recently increased levels.  Any future additional assessments, increases or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums could reduce our profitability, may limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities or otherwise negatively impact our operations.\n \nRevenues and profitability from our investment advisory business may be adversely affected by any reduction in assets under management, which could reduce fees earned.\nPWW, our investment advisory business derives the majority of its revenue from non-interest income, which primarily consists of investment advisory fees. \u00a0Substantially all of PWW\u2019s revenues are generated from investment management contracts with clients. Under these contracts, the investment advisory fees paid to us are typically based on the market value of assets under management. Assets under management may decline for various reasons including declines in the market value of the assets, which could be caused by price declines in the securities markets. Assets under management may also decrease due to redemptions and other withdrawals by clients or termination of contracts. This could be in response to adverse market conditions or in pursuit of other investment opportunities. If the assets under management we supervise decline and there is a related decrease in fees, it will negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain investment advisory clients.\n\n\n29\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\n \nDue to strong competition, our investment advisory business may not be able to attract and retain clients. Competition is strong because there are numerous well-established and successful investment management and wealth advisory firms including commercial banks and trust companies, investment advisory firms, mutual fund companies, stock brokerage firms, and other financial companies. Many of our competitors have greater resources than we have. Our ability to successfully attract and retain investment advisory clients is dependent upon our ability to compete with competitors' investment products, level of investment performance, client services and marketing and distribution capabilities. If we are not successful, our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted.\nThe investment advisory industry is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by regulators, and any enforcement action or adverse changes in the laws or regulations governing our business could decrease our revenues and profitability.\nAs an investment advisor registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, PWW is subject to regulation by a number of regulatory agencies that are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of customers participating in those markets. In the event of non-compliance with regulation, governmental regulators, including the SEC, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, may institute administrative or judicial proceedings that may result in censure, fines, civil penalties, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or the deregistration or suspension of the non-compliant broker-dealer or investment adviser or other adverse consequences. The imposition of any such penalties or orders could have a material adverse effect on the wealth management segment's operating results and financial condition. We may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations. Regulatory changes have imposed and may continue to impose additional costs, which could adversely impact our profitability.\nIf we fail to retain PWW\u2019s key employees, the growth and profitability of our investment advisory business could be adversely affected.\nPWW\u2019s success is, and is expected to remain, highly dependent on its executive management team as well as other key personnel because of their role in, among other things, making investment decisions for PWW clients and managing client relations. \u00a0Although each of the foregoing are subject to non-compete agreements, there are no assurances that these key personnel will remain employees of PWW.\nCompetition for investment advisory personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. Our failure to compete for these personnel, or the loss of the services of several of such key personnel, could adversely affect our growth strategy and seriously harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n \nREGULATORY AND LEGAL RISKS\n \nWe are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities and impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business, which limitations or restrictions could adversely affect our profitability. \n \nAs a bank holding company, we are primarily regulated by the Federal Reserve.  The Bank is primarily regulated by the BFI and the Federal Reserve.  These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of a financial institution, the classification of assets by a financial institution and the adequacy of a financial institution\u2019s allowance for loan losses.  The Company periodically reviews its policies, procedures and limits, and undertakes reporting, to ensure all guidance is appropriate for the Bank\u2019s current and planned operations and aligns with regulatory expectations.  In this regard, regulatory authorities may impose particular \n\n\n30\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nrequirements on the Bank, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  Any change in such regulation and regulatory oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations or legislation, could have a material impact on us and our operations.  Further, our compliance with Federal Reserve and the BFI regulations is costly. Because our business is highly regulated, the applicable laws, rules and regulations are subject to regular modification and change.  Laws, rules and regulations may be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or prospects.  For instance, such changes may limit our growth and restrict certain of our activities, including payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged, interest rates paid on deposits and locations of offices.  We are also subject to capital requirements by our regulators.  \n \nThe laws and regulations, including the Dodd-Frank Reform Act, applicable to the banking industry could \nchange\n at any time, and these changes may adversely affect our business and profitability. \n \nWe are subject to extensive federal and state regulation.  Because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of all commercial banks and bank holding companies, our cost of compliance could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably.  The increased scope, complexity, and cost of corporate governance, reporting, and disclosure practices are proportionately higher for a company of our size and will affect our profitability more than that of some of our larger competitors.  We expect to experience increasing compliance costs related to this supervision and regulation.  \n \nAlso, the 2020 national election results and new administration have introduced additional uncertainty into future implementation and enforcement of the Dodd-Frank Reform Act and other financial sector regulatory requirements. Such additional regulation and supervision may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. The effects of any such recently enacted, or proposed, legislation and regulatory programs on us cannot reliably be determined at this time.\n \nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s (the \u201cCFPB\u201d) \u201cability-to-repay\u201d and \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d rules may have a negative impact on our loan origination process and foreclosure proceedings, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\n \nOn January\u00a010, 2013, the CFPB issued a final rule to implement the \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d provisions of the Dodd-Frank Reform Act requiring mortgage lenders to consider consumers\u2019 ability to repay home loans before extending them credit.  The CFPB\u2019s \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d rule, which became effective on January\u00a010, 2014, describes certain minimum requirements for lenders making ability-to-repay determinations, but does not dictate that they follow particular underwriting models.  Lenders will be presumed to have complied with the ability-to-repay rule if they issue \u201cqualified mortgages,\u201d which are generally defined as mortgage loans prohibiting or limiting certain risky features.  Loans that do not meet the ability-to-repay standard can be challenged in court by borrowers who default, and the absence of ability-to-repay status can be used against a lender in foreclosure proceedings.  Any loans that we make outside of the \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d criteria could expose us to an increased risk of liability and reduce or delay our ability to foreclose upon the underlying property.  Any decreases in loan origination volume or increases in compliance and foreclosure costs caused by the rule could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  The CFPB also has adopted a number of additional requirements and issued additional guidance, including with respect to appraisals, escrow accounts and servicing, each of which entails increased compliance costs.  In addition, the CFPB likely will continue to make rules relating to consumer protection, and it is difficult to predict which of our products and services will be subject to these rules or how these rules will be implemented.\n \n\n\n31\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\n \nCompliance with the Dodd-Frank Reform Act will increase our regulatory compliance burdens, and may increase our operating costs and may adversely impact our earnings or capital ratios, or both.\n \nSigned into law on July\u00a021, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Reform Act has represented a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry.  Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Reform Act created the CFPB, tightened capital standards, imposed clearing and margining requirements on many derivatives activities and generally increased oversight and regulation of financial institutions and financial activities.\n \nIn addition to the self-implementing provisions of the statute, the Dodd-Frank Reform Act calls for over 200 administrative rulemakings by numerous federal agencies to implement various parts of the legislation.  While many rules have been finalized or issued in proposed form, additional rules have yet to be proposed.  It is not possible at this time to predict when all such additional rules will be issued or finalized, and what the content of such rules will be.  We will have to apply resources to ensure that we are in compliance with all applicable provisions of the Dodd-Frank Reform Act and any implementing rules, which may increase our costs of operations and adversely impact our earnings or capital, or both.\n \nThe Dodd-Frank Reform Act and any implementing rules that are ultimately issued could have adverse implications on the financial industry, the competitive environment and our ability to conduct business.\n \nThe short-\nterm\n and long-term impact of regulatory capital requirements and capital rules is uncertain\n.\n \n \nUnder the capital standards, in order to be well-capitalized, the Bank is required to have a common equity to Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5% and a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.0%.  The application of more stringent capital requirements for the Bank could, among other things, result in lower returns on invested capital, require the raising of additional capital and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Furthermore, the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the implementation of Basel III could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding, restructure our business models or increase our holdings of liquid assets, or all or any combination of the foregoing. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital or additional capital conservation buffers, or both, could result in management modifying its business strategy, and could limit our ability to make distributions, including paying out dividends or buying back shares.  \n \nPursuant to the Regulatory Relief Act, on September\u00a017, 2019, the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule regarding a\u00a0community bank leverage ratio.\n Under the final rule, which was effective on January\u00a01, 2021, depository institutions and depository institution holding companies that have less than $10\u00a0billion in total consolidated assets and meet other qualifying criteria, including a leverage ratio (equal to tier 1 capital divided by average total consolidated assets) of greater than 9 percent, will be eligible to opt into the community bank leverage ratio framework (qualifying community banking organizations). Qualifying community banking organizations that elect to use the community bank leverage ratio framework and that maintain a leverage ratio of greater than 9 percent will be considered to have satisfied the generally applicable risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the agencies\u2019 capital rules (generally applicable rule) and, if applicable, will be considered to have met the well-capitalized ratio requirements for purposes of section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.\n  At this point the Bank has chosen not to opt in to the community bank leverage ratio framework.\n \n\n\n32\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\n \nRISKS RELATED TO OUR STOCK\n \nOur ability to pay cash dividends is limited, and we may be unable to pay future dividends even if we desire to do so.\n \nThe Company is a legal entity, separate and distinct from the Bank.  The Company currently does not have any significant sources of revenue other than cash dividends paid to it by the Bank.  Both the Company and the Bank are subject to laws and regulations that limit the payment of cash dividends, including requirements to maintain capital at or above regulatory minimums.  As a bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System, the Bank must obtain prior written approval for any cash dividend if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years.\n \nBanking regulators have indicated that Virginia banking organizations should generally pay dividends only (1) from net undivided profits of the bank, after providing for all expenses, losses, interest and taxes accrued or due by the bank and (2) if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization\u2019s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. In addition, the FDIA prohibits insured depository institutions such as the Bank from making capital distributions, including the payment of dividends, if, after making such distribution, the institution would become undercapitalized as defined in the statute. Moreover, the Federal Reserve is authorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe and unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof.  The payment of dividends that deplete a bank\u2019s capital base could be deemed to constitute such an unsafe and unsound banking practice.  The Federal Reserve has indicated that banking organizations generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings.  The Bank may be prohibited under Virginia law from the payment of dividends, including in the event the BFI determines that a limitation of dividends is in the public interest and is necessary to ensure the Bank\u2019s financial soundness.\n \nIn addition, the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends will be limited if the Bank does not have the capital conservation buffer required by the capital rules, which may limit the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends to stockholders.\n \nIf the Bank is not permitted to pay cash dividends to the Company, it is unlikely that the Company would be able to pay cash dividends on our common stock.  Moreover, holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when and if declared by our board of directors.  Although we currently pay cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and our board of directors could reduce or eliminate the amount of our common stock dividends in the future.\n \nA limited \nmarket\n exists for our common stock.\n \nOur common stock commenced trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market on January\u00a025, 2012, and trading volumes since that time have been relatively low as compared to other larger financial services companies.  The limited trading market for our common stock may cause fluctuations in the market value of our common stock to be exaggerated, leading to price volatility in excess of that which would occur in a more active trading market.  Accordingly, holders of our common stock may have difficulty selling our common stock at prices which holders find acceptable or which accurately reflect the value of the Company.\n \nFuture \nofferings\n of debt or other securities may adversely affect the market price of our stock.\n \nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources or, if our or the Bank\u2019s capital ratios fall below the required minimums, we or the Bank could be forced to raise additional capital by making additional offerings of debt or preferred equity securities, including medium-term notes, trust preferred securities, senior \n\n\n33\nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nor subordinated notes and preferred stock. Upon liquidation, holders of any debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive distributions of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock.\n \nOur \nstockholders\n may experience dilution due to our issuance(s) of additional securities in the future.\n \nWe may in the future issue additional shares of our common stock to raise cash for operations or to fund acquisitions, to provide equity-based incentives to our management and employees, to permit our stockholders to invest cash dividends and optional cash payments in shares of our common stock or as consideration in acquisition transactions. Additional equity offerings and issuance(s) of additional shares of our common stock may dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our common stock, or both. No assurances can be given that the Company will not issue additional securities that will have the effect of diluting the equity interest of our stockholders. Holders of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution.\n \nVirginia law and the provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws could deter or prevent takeover \nattempts\n by a potential purchaser of our common stock that would be willing to pay holders a premium for their shares of our common stock.\n \nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may be deemed to have the effect of discouraging or delaying uninvited attempts by third parties to gain control of us. These provisions include the division of our board of directors into classes with staggered terms, the ability of our board of directors to set the price, terms and rights of, and to issue, one or more series of our preferred stock and the ability of our board of directors, in evaluating a proposed business combination or other fundamental change transaction, to consider the effect of the business combination on us and our stockholders, employees, customers and the communities which we serve.  Similarly, the Virginia Stock Corporation Act contains provisions designed to protect Virginia corporations and employees from the adverse effects of hostile corporate takeovers.  These provisions reduce the possibility that a third party could effect a change in control without the support of our incumbent directors.  These provisions may also strengthen the position of current management by restricting the ability of stockholders to change the composition of the board of directors, to affect its policies generally and to benefit from actions which are opposed by the current board of directors.\n ", "item7": ">Item 7.\n\u00a0\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of \n\u200e\nOperations\nItem 7A.\n\u00a0\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk\nItem 8.\n\u00a0\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\nItem 9A.\n\u00a0\nControls and Procedures\nItem 9B.\n\u00a0\nOther Information\nItem 9C.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections\nPART III\nItem 10.\n\u00a0\nDirectors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\nItem 11.\n\u00a0\nExecutive Compensation\nItem 12.\n\u00a0\nSecurity Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and \n\u200e\nRelated Stockholder Matters\nItem 13.\n\u00a0\nCertain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\nItem 14.\n\u00a0\nPrincipal Accounting Fees and Services\nPART IV\nItem 15.\n\u00a0\nExhibits, Financial Statement Schedules\nItem 16.\n\u00a0\nForm 10\u2013K Summary\nSIGNATURES\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nTable of Contents\n \n\n\nPART I\n ", "item7a": ">Item 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk\n \n \nNot applicable\n ", "companyName": "BANK OF THE JAMES FINANCIAL", "cusip": "063671101"}
