{"item1": ">Item\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0Business\nIntroduction\nWe are a blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this annual report as our initial business combination. We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a \u201cshell company\u201d as defined under the Exchange Act because we have no operations, other than in connection with our search for a business combination, and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.\nOur executive offices are located at 9 West 57th Street, 43rd Floor, New York, NY 10019, and our telephone number is (212) 515-3200. Our corporate website address is https://apollostrategicgrowthcapital.com. Our website and the information contained on, or that can be accessed through, the website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference in, and is not considered part of, this annual report. You should not rely on any such information in making your decision whether to invest in our securities.\nCompany History\nIn October\u00a02008, the Company was formed by Apollo Principal Holdings III,\u00a0L.P. (\u201c\nHoldings\n\u201d) and in August\u00a02020, Holdings transferred its ownership in the Company to our sponsor, APSG Sponsor,\u00a0L.P. As of March 1, 2022, our sponsor owned 20,345,250 of the 20,420,250 Class\u00a0B ordinary shares outstanding.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn October\u00a06, 2020, we consummated the initial public offering (the \u201c\nInitial Public Offering\n\u201d) of 75,000,000 units (the \u201c\nUnits\n\u201d), and in connection therewith granted the underwriters an over-allotment option to purchase an additional 11,250,000 Units (the \u201c\nOver-Allotment Units\n\u201d). The Units sold in the Initial Public Offering were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating total gross proceeds of $750,000,000. Each Unit consists of one of the Company\u2019s Class\u00a0A ordinary shares, par value $0.00005 per share, and one-third of one warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Class\u00a0A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments.\nSimultaneous with the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the private placement of an aggregate of 11,333,334 warrants, each exercisable to purchase one of the Company\u2019s Class\u00a0A ordinary shares for $11.50 per share (\u201c\nPrivate Placement Warrants\n\u201d), to our sponsor at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total proceeds of $17,000,000. \nOf the gross proceeds received from the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement Warrants, $750,000,000 was placed in a trust account (the \u201c\ntrust account\n\u201d). Each whole private placement warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Class\u00a0A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments.\n2\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOn November\u00a010, 2020, the Company consummated the sale of 6,681,000 Over-Allotment Units pursuant to the underwriters\u2019 partial exercise of their over-allotment option. Such Over-Allotment Units were sold at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $66,810,000. Substantially concurrently with the closing of the sale of 6,681,000 Over-Allotment Units, the Company consummated the private sale of an additional 890,800 Private Placement Warrants at a purchase price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant to our sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $1,336,200. Following the closing of the over-allotment option and sale of additional Private Placement Warrants (together, the \u201c\nOver-Allotment Closing\n\u201d), a total of $816,810,000, including approximately $28,588,350 of underwriters\u2019 deferred discount, was held in the trust account.\nOn November\u00a020, 2020, we announced that, commencing November\u00a023, 2020, holders of the Units may elect to separately trade the Class\u00a0A ordinary shares and the warrants included in the Units. Those Units not separated continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201c\nNYSE\n\u201d) under the symbol \u201cAPSG.U\u201d and the Class\u00a0A ordinary shares and warrants that are separated trade under the symbols \u201cAPSG\u201d and \u201cAPSG WS,\u201d respectively.\nGBT Business Combination\nOn December 2, 2021, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the \u201c\nBusiness Combination Agreement\n\u201d) with GBT, a company limited by shares incorporated under the laws of Jersey, pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Business Combination Agreement, GBT will become our direct subsidiary, with us being renamed \u201cGlobal Business Travel Group, Inc.\u201d (\u201c\nPubCo\n\u201d) and conducting its business through GBT in an umbrella partnership-C corporation structure (an \u201c\nUp-C structure\n\u201d). Upon the consummation of the business combination transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement (such transactions, the \u201c\nBusiness Combination\n\u201d, and such consummation, the \u201c\nClosing\n\u201d), the existing shareholders of GBT (other than any holders of GBT MIP Shares (as defined below)) (the \u201c\nContinuing JerseyCo Owners\n\u201d) will together acquire a majority voting interest in PubCo and maintain a majority economic interest in GBT, and our existing shareholders will own a minority voting interest in PubCo and an indirect minority economic interest in the GBT business.\nPursuant to, and in accordance with the terms, and subject to the conditions, of the Business Combination Agreement, we will change our jurisdiction of incorporation from the Cayman Islands to the State of Delaware by effecting a deregistration under the Cayman Islands Companies Act (2021 Revision), as amended, and a domestication under Section 388 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended (the \u201c\nDGCL\n\u201d) (such domestication, the \u201c\nDomestication\n\u201d). Upon the effectiveness of the Domestication, (a) each issued and outstanding Class A ordinary share of APSG (\u201c\nClass A ordinary share\n\u201d or \u201c\npublic share\n\u201d) will automatically convert into one share of Class A common stock of APSG (\u201c\nDomesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock\n\u201d); (b) each issued and outstanding Class B ordinary share of APSG (\u201c\nClass B ordinary share\n,\u201d and together with Class A ordinary shares, \u201c\nAcquiror Cayman Shares\n\u201d) will automatically convert into one share of Class X common stock of APSG (\u201c\nDomesticated Acquiror Class X Common Stock\n\u201d); (c) each issued and outstanding warrant to purchase one Class A ordinary share (\u201c\nAcquiror Cayman Warrant\n\u201d) will automatically convert into one warrant to purchase one share of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock (\u201c\nDomesticated Acquiror Warrant\n\u201d); and (d) each issued and outstanding unit of APSG (\u201c\nAcquiror Cayman Unit\n\u201d) will separate automatically into one share of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock and one-third of one Domesticated Acquiror Warrant. In addition, pursuant to the certificate of incorporation of PubCo (the \u201c\nCertificate of Incorporation\n\u201d), upon the Closing, each share of Domesticated Acquiror Class X Common Stock will automatically convert into one share of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock.\n3\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAs a result of the foregoing conversions and in connection with the Closing, our existing shareholders will maintain their economic and voting rights in PubCo in the form of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock. The Continuing JerseyCo Owners, who currently hold voting ordinary shares and non-voting ordinary shares of GBT (collectively, \u201c\nGBT Ordinary Shares\n\u201d), preferred shares of GBT (subject to the immediately following sentence) (the \u201c\nGBT Preferred Shares\n\u201d) and profit shares of GBT (the \u201c\nGBT Profit Shares\n\u201d), will receive voting rights in PubCo in the form of Class B common stock of PubCo (\u201c\nDomesticated Acquiror Class B Common Stock\n\u201d) and will maintain their economic rights (but have only certain limited voting rights as described below under \u201c\u2014Proposed Organizational Documents\u201d) in GBT in the form of equity interests of GBT following the Closing designated as \u201cB Ordinary Shares\u201d (\u201c\nOpCo B Ordinary Shares\n\u201d). Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, at or prior to the Closing, each GBT Preferred Share will be redeemed and cancelled, and, in consideration therefor, the holders of GBT Preferred Shares will receive, at the option of GBT, in its sole discretion, (i) cash in accordance with the terms of GBT\u2019s memorandum of association and articles of association as in effect immediately prior to the Closing or (ii) a number of voting ordinary shares of GBT equal to the amount of cash that such holders of GBT Preferred Shares would have received pursuant to clause (i) above divided by $10.00 or (iii) a combination of the consideration described in clause (i) and (ii). Further, (a) any non-voting management incentive plan shares of GBT (\u201c\nGBT MIP Shares\n\u201d) will be redeemed and cancelled and, in consideration therefor, at the option of GBT (but subject to our prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)), the holders thereof will receive either (i) cash equal to the fair market value of such GBT MIP Shares (as determined by the board of directors of GBT) or (ii) a number of shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock and OpCo C Ordinary Shares (as defined below); and (b) each option to purchase GBT MIP Shares (each, a \u201c\nGBT MIP Option\n\u201d) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Closing, whether vested or unvested, will be equitably converted based on a deemed $10.00 price per share of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock into an option to purchase shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock on substantially the same terms and conditions as are in effect with respect to such GBT MIP Option immediately prior to the Closing (each, an \u201c\nAcquiror Option\n\u201d) in a manner determined by GBT in consultation with us and consistent with certain U.S. tax regulations.\nIn addition, in connection with the Closing, PubCo will acquire and hold all equity interests of GBT designated as \u201cA Ordinary Shares\u201d (\u201c\nOpCo A Ordinary Shares\n\u201d), which will have pro rata economic rights and all of the voting rights in GBT (subject to certain limited rights of the OpCo B Ordinary Shares described below under \u201c\u2014Proposed Organizational Documents\u201d), and one non-redeemable \u201cZ Ordinary Share\u201d (\u201c\nOpCo Z Ordinary Share\n\u201d), which will have no economic or voting rights in GBT, in exchange for a purchase price equal to the sum of (a) the amount of cash available in our trust account following the Special Meeting (as defined below), after deducting the amount required to satisfy any redemptions by our existing shareholders and the amount required to satisfy any unpaid transaction expenses, plus the amount of our cash on hand (outside of the trust account) immediately prior to the Closing, plus (b) the aggregate amount of the PIPE Investment (as defined below), plus (c) the amount of cash actually drawn under any debt financing obtained by us (excluding any loans or other indebtedness or transaction expenses repaid at or prior to the Closing in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, the \u201c\nTransactions\n\u201d)) prior to or at the Closing, plus (d) the Acquiror Class B Common Stock Purchase Price (as defined below) (the \u201c\nAcquiror Subscribed Ordinary Shares Purchase Price\n\u201d).\nThe number of OpCo B Ordinary Shares (and corresponding shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class B Common Stock) and shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock (including those underlying the Acquiror Options) issued to the Continuing JerseyCo Owners and former holders of GBT MIP Shares and GBT MIP Options, as well as any Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock issued upon the exercise of any Acquiror Options (as may be permitted by GBT or PubCo) or upon the exchange of any OpCo B Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Exchange Agreement (as described below), are subject to certain adjustments (the \u201c\nEgencia Adjustments\n\u201d) in connection with the post-closing equity adjustment (the \u201cP\nost-Closing Equity Adjustment\n\u201d) required under the Equity Contribution Agreement, dated as of August 11, 2021, by and among Expedia, Inc., GBT and Juweel Investors Limited entered into in connection with GBT\u2019s acquisition of the Egencia business from an affiliate of Expedia, Inc., EG Corporate Travel Holdings LLC (\u201c\nExpedia\n\u201d), if the final determination of the Post-Closing Equity Adjustment has not occurred prior to the Closing; provided, that if GBT and Expedia agree to settle, and do in fact settle, any Post-Closing Equity Adjustment, in whole, for an amount in cash of $5 million or less, then no adjustment will be made.\n4\n\n\nTable of Contents\nEarnout\nPursuant to the Business Combination Agreement and on the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, the holders of GBT Ordinary Shares, GBT Preferred Shares, GBT Profit Shares, GBT MIP Shares and certain legacy GBT MIP Options (\u201c\nGBT Legacy MIP Options\n\u201d) will also receive an aggregate of 15,000,000 \u201cearnout\u201d shares in the form of equity interests of GBT following the Closing designated as \u201cC Ordinary Shares\u201d (\u201c\nOpCo C Ordinary Shares\n\u201d), which will, upon certain post-Closing events described below occurring within five years from Closing (such period, the \u201c\nEarnout Period\n\u201d), (a) in the case of the former holders of GBT Ordinary Shares, GBT Preferred Shares and GBT Profit Shares, be converted and re-designated into OpCo B Ordinary Shares, with PubCo issuing such holders shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class B Common Stock, or (b) in the case of holders of GBT MIP Shares and GBT Legacy MIP Options, be redeemed and cancelled, with the holders thereof receiving shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock (clauses (a) and (b), each an \u201c\nEarnout Achievement Distribution\n\u201d). If, within the Earnout Period, the volume-weighted average price (the \u201c\nVWAP\n\u201d) of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock is greater than or equal to $12.50 for any 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days, holders of OpCo C Ordinary Shares will receive their applicable Earnout Achievement Distribution with respect to 50% of their OpCo C Ordinary Shares. If, within the Earnout Period, the VWAP of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock is greater than or equal to $15.00 for any 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days, holders of OpCo C Ordinary Shares will receive their applicable Earnout Achievement Distribution with respect to the remaining 50% of their OpCo C Ordinary Shares. The earnout may also be deemed triggered if certain consideration thresholds are satisfied in connection with the occurrence of certain change of control events during the Earnout Period. To the extent that the aforementioned triggering events do not occur within the Earnout Period, the applicable OpCo C Ordinary Shares will be forfeited and cancelled for no consideration. The Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock price targets and the number of shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock, shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class B Common Stock and OpCo B Ordinary Shares will be equitably adjusted for stock splits, reverse stock splits, dividends (cash or stock), reorganizations, recapitalizations, reclassifications, combinations or other like changes or transactions with respect to the OpCo B Ordinary Shares, shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class B Common Stock and Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock occurring after the Closing.\nRepresentations, Warranties and Covenants\nThe parties to the Business Combination Agreement have made customary representations and warranties in the Business Combination Agreement. The parties have also made customary covenants in the Business Combination Agreement that apply to the pre-Closing period, including, among others, covenants with respect to (a) the conduct of business of GBT and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and our Company, on the other hand, (b) compliance with the notification and reporting requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the \u201c\nHSR Act\n\u201d), (c) our submission of an informal briefing paper to the United Kingdom Investment Security Unit in relation to approval of the Transactions under the National Security and Investment Act 2021 (United Kingdom) (the \u201c\nNSIA\n\u201d) and notification of the U.K. Secretary of State of the Transactions in accordance with section 14(1) of the NSIA, (d) the non-solicitation by either party of any proposal or offer from any third party relating to a potential competing transaction. The representations, warranties and covenants to be performed at or prior to the Closing will not survive the Closing and (e) GBT\u2019s reasonable best efforts to enter into definitive agreements with Amex Holdco in respect of certain commercial arrangements.\nIn addition, we and GBT have been jointly preparing, and APSG has been filing with the SEC, mutually acceptable materials which include the proxy statement (the \u201c\nProxy Statement\n\u201d) relating to the special meeting of our shareholders in connection with the Transactions (the \u201c\nSpecial Meeting\n\u201d), and the Registration Statement with respect to the registration under the Securities Act, of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock and including the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. We agreed to, through our board of directors, recommend to our existing shareholders that they approve each of the proposals to be put forth at the Special Meeting in connection with the Transactions, including, among others, the approval of the Business Combination Agreement (the \u201c\nShareholder Proposals\n\u201d), unless our board of directors has changed its recommendation in accordance with the express terms of the Business Combination Agreement (a \u201c\nModification in Recommendation\n\u201d).\n5\n\n\nTable of Contents\nConditions to Closing\nThe Closing is subject to certain conditions, including, among other things, (i) that the approval of the Shareholder Proposals (other than any separate or unbundled advisory proposals as are required to implement the Domestication or the changes to APSG\u2019s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association) has been obtained; (ii) the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act (which expired at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on January 18, 2022) and receipt of approval from (or a notification or final notification that no further action will be taken by) the U.K. Secretary of State pursuant to the NSIA (including a notification by the U.K. Secretary of State that no further action will be taken in relation to the transaction, or final notification by the U.K. Secretary of State that no further action will be taken by the NSIA in relation to a call-in notice in respect of the transaction) (which was received on February 23, 2022); (iii) that the amount of available cash at Closing, including the amount in our trust account (net of APSG Share Redemption (as defined below), our cash on hand (outside the trust account) and the aggregate gross purchase price received by us in connection with the PIPE Investment, is at least $300 million (which is only a condition in favor of GBT, but cannot be waived without our prior written consent (such consent to not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)); (iv) satisfaction of covenant and representation and warranty bring-down conditions and receipt of certificates from each party certifying the satisfaction of such conditions; (v) the absence of any law or order that would prohibit or make illegal the Transactions; (vi) the absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect or an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect (as each is defined in the Business Combination Agreement); (vii) the approval of the listing of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange; (viii) the effectiveness of the Domestication; (ix) APSG\u2019s net tangible assets not being less than $5,000,001; and (x) the effectiveness of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. To the extent permitted by law (and subject to the limitation described in clause (iii) above), the conditions in the Business Combination Agreement may be waived by the parties thereto.\nTermination Rights\nThe Business Combination Agreement may be terminated by either us or GBT at any time prior to Closing as follows: (a) by mutual written consent of us and GBT; (b) by either us or GBT if any applicable government entity enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any order which has become final and non-appealable and has the effect of enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of the Business Combination, or if a law is adopted that permanently makes consummation of the Business Combination illegal or otherwise prohibited; (c) by either us or GBT if approval of the Shareholder Proposals is not obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at the Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof; (d) by GBT prior to us obtaining approval of the Shareholder Proposals at the Special Meeting if there has been a Modification in Recommendation; (e) by either us or GBT if the other party breaches any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements such that the conditions to Closing relating to the representations, warranties and covenants of such other party would not be satisfied at the Closing (subject to a cure period), so long as the terminating party is not then in material breach of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements such that the conditions to the obligations of the other party would not be satisfied at the Closing; or (f) by either us or GBT if the Closing has not occurred on or before August 2, 2022.\nThe assertions embodied in those representations, warranties and covenants were made for purposes of the contract among the parties and are subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiating the Business Combination Agreement. The Business Combination Agreement has been included as Exhibit 2.1 to provide investors with information regarding its terms and is not intended to provide any other factual information about APSG, GBT or any other person or entity. In particular, the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in the Business Combination Agreement, which were made only for purposes of the Business Combination Agreement and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Business Combination Agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties (including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Business Combination Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts) and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors and reports and documents filed with the SEC. Investors should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, or any descriptions thereof, as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of any party to the Business Combination Agreement. In addition, the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements and other terms of the Business Combination Agreement may be subject to subsequent waiver or modification. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties and other terms may change after the date of the Business Combination Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in APSG\u2019s public disclosures.\n6\n\n\nTable of Contents\nProposed Organizational Documents\nFollowing the Closing, the rights of holders of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock and Domesticated Acquiror Class B Common Stock will be governed by the Proposed Charter and the Bylaws of PubCo (the \u201c\nProposed Bylaws\n\u201d). The Proposed Charter contains provisions related to the Egencia Adjustments and exchanges under the Exchange Agreement (as defined below). Pursuant to the Proposed Charter, PubCo will elect not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL. The Proposed Charter will, however, include provisions similar to Section 203 of the DGCL that generally prohibit PubCo from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless (i) such person became an interested stockholder as a result of a transaction approved by the PubCo board of directors (other than the Business Combination), (ii) such person acquired at least 85% of PubCo\u2019s voting stock (excluding shares owned by officers and directors of PubCo and employee stock plans) in the transaction by which such person became an interested stockholder or (iii) such transactions are approved by the PubCo board of directors and the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of PubCo\u2019s outstanding voting stock (other than such stock owned by the interested stockholder). In general, a person and its affiliates and associates will be an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d under the Proposed Charter if such person (a) holds at least 15% of PubCo\u2019s voting stock or is an affiliate or associate of PubCo and (b) held at least 15% of PubCo\u2019s voting stock at any time during the three-year period preceding the date on which it is sought to be determined whether such person is an interested stockholder; however, a person that acquires greater than 15% of PubCo\u2019s voting stock solely as a result of actions taken by PubCo will not be an interested stockholder unless such person thereafter acquires additional shares of voting stock other than as a result of further corporate action not caused by such person. Further, the foregoing restrictions will not apply if the business combination is with a person who became an interested stockholder as a result of the Business Combination (provided such person does not acquire more than an additional 1% of the outstanding shares of PubCo\u2019s voting stock after the date of the Closing). The Proposed Charter generally contains customary provisions for the certificate of incorporation of a publicly traded company, including provisions for a classified board of directors. The Proposed Bylaws generally contain customary provisions for the bylaws of a publicly traded company.\nFollowing the Closing, the rights of holders of OpCo A Ordinary Shares, OpCo B Ordinary Shares, Opco C Ordinary Shares and OpCo Z Ordinary Shares will be governed by the Fourth Amended & Restated Memorandum of Association of GBT and the Third Amended & Restated Articles of Association of GBT (collectively, the \u201c\nGBT Amended and Restated M&A\n\u201d). The GBT Amended and Restated M&A will, among other things, modify GBT\u2019s capital structure by reorganizing the different classes of shares currently held by the shareholders of GBT into new OpCo B Ordinary Shares and authorizing new OpCo A Ordinary Shares (which will be issued to PubCo), OpCo C Ordinary Shares (which will be issued to the Continuing JerseyCo Owners and certain other persons as described above) and the OpCo Z Ordinary Share (which will be issued to PubCo). OpCo A Ordinary Shares will be substantially the same as OpCo B Ordinary Shares, except that only OpCo A Ordinary Shares, all of which will be held by PubCo, will have the right to vote on matters on which members of GBT generally are entitled to vote, including in the election of the board of directors of GBT. By contrast, OpCo B Ordinary Shares and OpCo C Ordinary Shares will have the right to vote only on specific matters as to which they are entitled to vote as a separate class under Jersey law. Pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement (as defined below), however, the Continuing JerseyCo Owners will appoint PubCo as their attorney-in-fact to, among other things, execute (x) written resolutions in their capacities as holders of OpCo B Ordinary Shares and OpCo C Ordinary Shares, as applicable, and (y) instruments appointing PubCo as their proxy to vote such shares, in each case on all such matters as to which a vote or written resolution of the holders of such shares is required by law, other than matters that relate specifically and solely to the rights, priorities and privileges of the OpCo B Ordinary Shares or the OpCo C Ordinary Shares, as applicable, or matters that have a disproportionate adverse effect on the OpCo B Ordinary Shares or the OpCo C Ordinary Shares, as applicable, as compared to any other class or series. The GBT Amended and Restated M&A will contain corollary provisions giving effect to these arrangements. The OpCo Z Ordinary Share does not have the right to vote and is non-redeemable by GBT under the GBT Amended and Restated M&A.\n7\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPIPE Subscription Agreements\nOn December 2, 2021, concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, the Company entered into subscription agreements (the \u201c\nPIPE Subscription Agreements\n\u201d) with certain strategic and institutional investors, including the Sponsor (as defined below) (collectively, the \u201c\nPIPE Investors\n\u201d), pursuant to which, among other things, and on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, the PIPE Investors agreed to subscribe for and purchase, and the Company agreed to issue and sell to such PIPE Investors, immediately prior to the Closing, an aggregate of 33,500,000 shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock at a cash purchase price of $10.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price equal to $335 million (the \u201c\nPIPE Investment\n\u201d). Of the 33,500,000 shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the PIPE Subscription Agreements, the Sponsor has agreed to purchase 2,000,000 shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock on the same terms and conditions as the other PIPE Investors at a price of $10.00 per share. The PIPE Subscription Agreements contain customary representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company and the PIPE Investors and are subject to customary closing conditions, including the substantially concurrent consummation of the Business Combination.\nPursuant to the PIPE Subscription Agreements, PubCo is required to submit or file with the SEC, within (i) 30 calendar days after the Closing or (ii) 90 calendar days following PubCo\u2019s most recent fiscal year end if audited financials for the year ended December 31, 2021 are required to be included, a registration statement on Form S-1 or Form S-3, as applicable (\u201c\nShelf\n\u201d), covering the resale of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock issued pursuant to the PIPE Subscription Agreements and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to have such Shelf declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof, but no later than the earlier of (i) 60 calendar days (or 90 calendar days if the SEC notifies PubCo that it will \u201creview\u201d the Shelf) after the filing thereof and (ii) the 10th business day after the date PubCo is notified (orally or in writing, whichever is earlier) by the SEC that the Shelf will not be \u201creviewed\u201d or will not be subject to further review. The PIPE Subscription Agreements will terminate and be void with no further force or effect upon the earliest to occur of: (a) such date and time as the Business Combination Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms; (b) the mutual written agreement of the parties to the PIPE Subscription Agreement and GBT; or (c) if the applicable PIPE Investment has not been consummated within 10 months after the date thereof, other than as a result of breach by the terminating party.\nAcquiror Class B Common Stock Subscription Agreement\nIn connection with the Business Combination Agreement, PubCo and GBT will enter into a subscription agreement (the \u201c\nAcquiror Class B Common Stock Subscription Agreement\n\u201d) pursuant to which PubCo will issue and sell to GBT, and GBT will subscribe for and purchase from PubCo, shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class B Common Stock (the \u201c\nGBT Subscription\n\u201d) in exchange for the amount which equals the product of (a) $0.0001 per share and (b) the aggregate number of shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class B Common Stock to be subscribed for by GBT (the \u201c\nAcquiror Class B Common Stock Purchase Price\n\u201d).\nAcquiror Subscribed Ordinary Shares Subscription Agreement\nIn connection with the Business Combination Agreement, GBT and PubCo will enter into a subscription agreement (the \u201c\nAcquiror Subscribed Ordinary Shares Subscription Agreement\n\u201d) pursuant to which GBT will issue and sell to PubCo, and PubCo will subscribe for and purchase from GBT, OpCo A Ordinary Shares and one OpCo Z Ordinary Share in exchange for the Acquiror Subscribed Ordinary Shares Purchase Price.\nAcquiror Class B Common Stock Distribution Agreement\nIn connection with the Business Combination Agreement, GBT and the Continuing JerseyCo Owners will enter into a distribution agreement (the \u201c\nAcquiror Class B Common Stock Distribution Agreement\n\u201d) pursuant to which, following the GBT Subscription, GBT will distribute to the Continuing JerseyCo Owners, and each Continuing JerseyCo Owner will accept from GBT, the shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class B Common Stock that GBT acquired in connection with the GBT Subscription, in partial consideration for the redemption and cancellation of the GBT Ordinary Shares held by the Continuing JerseyCo Owners.\n8\n\n\nTable of Contents\nSponsor Support Agreement\nIn connection with the Business Combination Agreement, on December 2, 2021, the Sponsor, members of our board of directors and management (the \u201c\nInsiders\n\u201d) and GBT entered into a support agreement (the \u201c\nSponsor Support Agreement\n\u201d). Pursuant to the Sponsor Support Agreement, the Sponsor and each Insider agreed to, among other things, vote or cause to be voted, all of the Acquiror Cayman Shares beneficially owned by it, at the Special Meeting: (i) in favor of all the Shareholder Proposals, (ii) against any competing transaction, (iii) against any change in the business, our management or our board of directors that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect our ability to consummate the Transactions or is otherwise inconsistent with any of our obligations under the Business Combination Agreement, and (iv) against any other proposal, agreement or action that would reasonably be expected to (a) impede, frustrate, prevent or nullify, or materially delay or materially impair our ability to perform our obligations under, any provision of the Business Combination Agreement or the transaction documents, (b) result in any of the conditions to Closing not being satisfied or (c) result in our breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or other obligation or agreement under the Business Combination Agreement or result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or other obligation or agreement of the Sponsor or the Insiders contained in the Sponsor Support Agreement. The Sponsor and each Insider also agreed not to redeem any of the Acquiror Cayman Shares beneficially owned by them in connection with the Transactions or sell any of their Acquiror Cayman Shares, Acquiror Cayman Units or Acquiror Cayman Warrants (other than to certain permitted transferees) during the pre-Closing period. Further, the Sponsor and each Insider have agreed to comply with certain provisions of the Business Combination Agreement, including the provisions regarding non-solicitation, confidentiality and publicity, as if they were APSG with respect to such provisions, and to execute and deliver all documents and take all actions reasonably necessary by them for us to comply with its obligations relating to regulatory approvals in the Business Combination Agreement.\nSponsor Side Letter\nIn connection with the Business Combination Agreement, on December 2, 2021, the Sponsor, the Insiders, APSG and GBT entered into a letter agreement (the \u201c\nSponsor Side Letter\n\u201d). Pursuant to the Sponsor Side Letter, the Sponsor and each Insider has agreed not to transfer (other than to certain permitted transferees) (i) any shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock issued to each of them at the Closing, until the earlier to occur of (a) one year following the Closing and (b) (x) the date on which the last reported sale price of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the Closing or (y) the date on which PubCo completes a liquidation, merger, share exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of PubCo\u2019s shareholders having the right to exchange their shares for cash, securities or other property; and (ii) any of the Domesticated Acquiror Warrants (or any shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock issued or issuable upon exercise of the Domesticated Acquiror Warrants) issued to each of them at the Closing until 30 days after the Closing.\nIn addition, pursuant to the Sponsor Side Letter, the Sponsor has agreed that 13,631,318 of the shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock issued to the Sponsor at the Closing (the \u201c\nSponsor Shares\n\u201d) will immediately vest without restrictions and 6,713,932 of the Sponsor Shares will be deemed unvested subject to certain triggering events to occur within five years from Closing (such period, the \u201c\nSponsor Side Letter Vesting Period\n\u201d). If, within the Sponsor Side Letter Vesting Period, the VWAP of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock is greater than or equal to $12.50 for any 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days, 3,356,966 of the unvested Sponsor Shares will vest. If, within the Sponsor Side Letter Vesting Period, the VWAP of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock is greater than or equal to $15.00 for any 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days, the remaining 3,356,966 of the unvested Sponsor Shares will vest. The Sponsor Shares may also be deemed vested if certain consideration thresholds are satisfied in connection with the occurrence of certain change of control events during the Sponsor Side Letter Vesting Period. To the extent that either of the aforementioned triggering events do not occur within the Sponsor Side Letter Vesting Period, such Sponsor Shares will be forfeited and surrendered to PubCo. The number of shares and the price targets listed above will be equitably adjusted for stock splits, reverse stock splits, dividends (cash or stock), reorganizations, recapitalizations, reclassifications, combinations or other like changes or transactions with respect to the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock occurring after the Closing.\n9\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCompany Holders Support Agreement\nIn connection with the Business Combination Agreement, on December 2, 2021, the Continuing JerseyCo Owners and GBT entered into a support agreement (the \u201c\nCompany Holders Support Agreement\n\u201d). Pursuant to the Company Holders Support Agreement, each of the Continuing JerseyCo Owners agreed to, among other things, during the pre-Closing period, execute, deliver or otherwise grant any action by written consent, special resolution or other approval, or vote or cause to be voted at any meeting of shareholders of GBT: (i) in favor of any such consent, resolution or other approval, as may be required under the organizational documents of GBT or applicable law or otherwise sought with respect to the Business Combination Agreement or the Transactions (including in order to effect the transactions set forth in Section 2.1 of the Business Combination Agreement) and (ii) against any competing transaction and any other proposal, agreement or action that would reasonably be expected to (a) prevent or nullify, or materially delay or materially impair the ability of GBT to perform its obligations under, any provision of the Business Combination Agreement or the transaction documents, (b) result in any of the conditions to Closing not being satisfied or (c) result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or other obligation or agreement of the Continuing JerseyCo Owners contained in the Company Holders Support Agreement. Each of the Continuing JerseyCo Owners also agreed not to sell any of its GBT Ordinary Shares, GBT Preferred Shares or GBT Profit Shares (other than to certain permitted transferees) during the pre-Closing period. Further, each Continuing JerseyCo Owner has agreed to comply with certain provisions of the Business Combination Agreement, including the provisions regarding non-solicitation and publicity, as if they were GBT with respect to such provisions, and to execute and deliver on the date of Closing, the Shareholders Agreement, the Acquiror Class B Common Stock Distribution Agreement, the Exchange Agreement (as defined below) and the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement (as defined below).\nAdditionally, each Continuing JerseyCo Owner has agreed not to transfer, until the 180th day following the date of Closing (the \u201c\nUW Lock-Up Release Date\n\u201d), any equity securities of PubCo or GBT (subject to certain permitted exceptions); provided, that if the final determination of the Post-Closing Equity Adjustment has not occurred prior to the expiration of the UW Lock-Up Release Date, then each Continuing JerseyCo Owner agrees to retain and not transfer at least 5% of each class of securities of each of PubCo and GBT (subject to certain permitted exceptions) that it receives in connection with the Closing, from the UW Lock-Up Release Date until the completion of the implementation of the adjustments set forth in the Business Combination Agreement in connection with the Post-Closing Equity Adjustment.\nAmex Holdco and its affiliates have also agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to enter into definitive agreements with GBT in respect of certain commercial arrangements.\nAmended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement\nAt the Closing, PubCo, the Sponsor, the Insiders and the Continuing JerseyCo Owners (collectively, the \u201c\nHolders\n\u201d) will enter into an amended and restated registration rights agreement pursuant to which, among other things, PubCo will agree to register for resale, pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act, certain shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock and other equity securities of PubCo that are held by the Holders from time to time (the \u201c\nAmended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement\n\u201d). Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement, PubCo will be required to submit or file with the SEC, within (i) 30 calendar days after the Closing or (ii) 90 calendar days following PubCo\u2019s most recent fiscal year end if audited financials are required to be included, a Shelf covering the issuance and the resale of all such registrable securities on a delayed or continuous basis, and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to have such Shelf declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof, but no later than the earlier of (i) 60 calendar days (or 90 calendar days if the SEC notifies PubCo that it will \u201creview\u201d the Shelf) after the filing thereof and (ii) the 10th business day after the date PubCo is notified (orally or in writing, whichever is earlier) by the SEC that the Shelf will not be \u201creviewed\u201d or will not be subject to further review.\nWhen an effective Shelf is on file with the SEC, the Sponsor and the Insiders may collectively demand not more than one underwritten shelf takedown per fiscal quarter and each Continuing JerseyCo Owner may demand not more than one underwritten shelf takedown per fiscal quarter, in each case, subject to certain customary limitations set forth in the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement, including the right of the underwriters to limit the number of securities to be included in an underwritten offering and PubCo\u2019s right to delay or withdraw a registration statement under certain circumstances. The Holders will also be entitled to certain piggyback registration rights and indemnification rights.\n10\n\n\nTable of Contents\nExchange Agreement\nAt the Closing, PubCo, GBT and the Continuing JerseyCo Owners will enter into an exchange agreement (the \u201c\nExchange Agreement\n\u201d), giving the Continuing JerseyCo Owners (or certain of their permitted transferees) the right, on the terms and subject to the conditions of the Exchange Agreement, to exchange their OpCo B Ordinary Shares (with automatic surrender for cancellation of an equal number of shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class B Common Stock) for shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to customary adjustments for stock splits, dividends, reclassifications and other similar transactions or, in certain limited circumstances, at the option of a committee of PubCo\u2019s board consisting solely of independent and disinterested (with respect to any particular exchange) members (the \u201c\nExchange Committee\n\u201d), for cash (based on the VWAP of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock for the five trading day period ending on the trading day immediately preceding the applicable exchange date). In addition, to preserve the contemplated Up-C structure, the Exchange Agreement provides that PubCo and GBT will take (or, in some cases, forbear from taking) various actions, as necessary to maintain a one-to-one ratio between the number of issued and outstanding (x) Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock (and equivalents) and the OpCo A Ordinary Shares and (y) Domesticated Acquiror Class B Common Stock and the OpCo B Ordinary Shares. For example, the Exchange Agreement provides that, if PubCo issues or sells additional shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock, PubCo will contribute the net proceeds of such issuance and sale to GBT, and GBT will issue to PubCo an equal number of OpCo A Ordinary Shares. Similarly, the Exchange Agreement provides that neither PubCo nor GBT may effect any subdivision or combination of any of its equity securities unless the other effects an identical subdivision or combination of the corresponding class of its equity securities.\nShareholders Agreement\nAt Closing, PubCo, GBT, American Express Travel Holdings Netherlands Co\u00f6peratief U.A. (\u201c\nAmex HoldCo\n\u201d), Juweel Investors (SPC) Limited (\u201c\nJuweel\n\u201d) and Expedia will enter into a shareholders agreement (the \u201c\nShareholders Agreement\n\u201d). The Shareholders Agreement will set forth certain agreements with respect to, among other matters, transfers of equity securities of PubCo and GBT, the governance of PubCo and GBT, tax distributions that GBT will make to PubCo and the Continuing JerseyCo Owners and certain information rights of the Continuing JerseyCo Owners.\nThe Shareholders Agreement will set forth various restrictions, limitations and other terms governing the Continuing JerseyCo Owners\u2019 transfer of equity securities of PubCo and GBT (other than, in most circumstances, the OpCo A Ordinary Shares). Among other matters, and subject to certain terms, conditions and exceptions, the Shareholders Agreement generally will prohibit transfers of such equity securities to certain specified restricted persons, as well as transfers that would violate applicable securities laws or cause GBT to be treated other than as a pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThe Shareholders Agreement will specify the initial composition of the PubCo board of directors, effective immediately upon the Domestication and Closing. PubCo will agree with each Continuing JerseyCo Owner (on a several basis), following the Closing, to take all necessary action within its control to cause its board to have eleven directors, consisting of the Chief Executive Officer, two Amex HoldCo nominees, two Juweel nominees, one Expedia nominee and, for as long as the director designated by the Sponsor is serving on the board, four independent nominees nominated by the board\u2019s nominating and governance committee, and, following the conclusion of the Sponsor designee\u2019s service on the board, five such nominees. If Amex HoldCo or Juweel ceases to own at least 15% of PubCo\u2019s issued shares, it will thereafter have the right to nominate only one director, and if any Continuing JerseyCo ceases to own at least 5% of PubCo\u2019s issued shares, it will thereafter have no right to nominate a director, except that Amex HoldCo will continue to have the right to nominate director for so long as PubCo is a \u201ccontrolled entity\u201d under the Bank Holding Company Act.\nThe Shareholders Agreement will also require (subject to certain specified conditions and exceptions including those described below) the approval of each Continuing JerseyCo Owner for PubCo or its subsidiaries to take certain actions, including:\n\u25cf\nOther than in accordance with the Proposed Charter or pursuant to an issuer tender offer or share repurchase program that, in each case, was approved by PubCo\u2019s board of directors , the redemption, cancellation or repayment of PubCo\u2019s or GBT\u2019s equity securities, other than on a pro rata basis;\n\u25cf\nDividends or distributions, other than on a pro rata basis;\n11\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u25cf\nShare exchanges, splits, combinations and similar actions with respect to one or more, but not all, classes or series of PubCo or GBT shares;\n\u25cf\nAmendments to GBT\u2019s organizational documents that relate specifically and solely to rights, priorities or privileges of the OpCo B Ordinary Shares or the OpCo C Ordinary Shares, as applicable, or have a disproportionate adverse effect on such shares as compared to any other class or series of shares, and do not require a separate class vote of the holders of such shares; or\n\u25cf\nAny agreement or commitment to do any of the foregoing.\nIn general, the foregoing approval right of a Continuing JerseyCo Owner will terminate if such Continuing JerseyCo Owner ceases to own at least 10% of the issued shares of PubCo\u2019s stock; however, an amendment of GBT\u2019s organizational documents of the type described in the fourth bullet in the preceding sentence will require the approval of any Continuing JerseyCo Owner to which such amendment is materially adverse, regardless of such Continuing JerseyCo Owner\u2019s percentage ownership of PubCo\u2019s stock at such time. The foregoing approval rights do not apply to actions that PubCo or JerseyCo undertake to effect an Egencia Adjustment or that they are authorized to undertake pursuant to the Exchange Agreement.\nEach Continuing JerseyCo Owner will appoint PubCo as its attorney-in-fact to, among other things, execute (x) written resolutions in their capacities as holders of OpCo B Ordinary Shares and OpCo C Ordinary Shares, as applicable, and (y) instruments appointing PubCo as their proxy to vote such shares, in each case on all such matters as to which a vote or written resolution of the holders of such shares is required by law, other than matters that relate specifically and solely to the rights, priorities and privileges of the OpCo B Ordinary Shares or the OpCo C Ordinary Shares, as applicable, or matters that have a disproportionate adverse effect on the OpCo B Ordinary Shares or the OpCo C Ordinary Shares, as applicable, as compared to any other class or series.\nThe Shareholders Agreement will require GBT to make pro rata cash distributions to GBT\u2019s shareholders, including PubCo, in amounts intended to be sufficient to enable PubCo to satisfy its liabilities for taxes, as reasonably determined by the board of directors of GBT.\nThe Shareholders Agreement will require PubCo and GBT to provide the Continuing JerseyCo Owners, for their financial planning processes, certain financial information beyond that which PubCo will make available publicly in its periodic reports filed with the SEC.\nBusiness Strategy; Acquisition Criteria\nOur acquisition and value creation strategy is to identify, acquire and, after our initial business combination, further accelerate the growth of a company in the public markets.\nConsistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective targets for our initial business combination. We will leverage these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but to the extent our pending Business Combination with GBT is not consummated and we search for other acquisition opportunities, we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to acquire target businesses that we believe:\n\u25cf\nare leading companies that have exhibited positive top-line growth and/or are experiencing secular tailwinds;\n\u25cf\nhave defensible and established business models, with sustainable competitive advantages and multiple avenues for growth;\n\u25cf\ncan potentially benefit from having a public currency to accelerate growth trajectory;\n\u25cf\ncan benefit from our management team and Apollo\u2019s operating expertise, industry network and financing experience;\n\u25cf\nare not reliant on financial leverage to generate returns;\n12\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u25cf\nare at the point in their lifecycle at which going public is a natural next step; and\n\u25cf\nwill offer an attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.\nWe do not intend to pursue an acquisition in the natural resources or energy industries, including the upstream, midstream and energy services sub-sectors.\nThese criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. While we have used these criteria and guidelines in evaluating opportunities such as our pending Business Combination with GBT, we may decide to enter into an initial business combination with another target business that only meets some but not all of these criteria and guidelines. In the event that we do not consummate the pending Business Combination with GBT and decide to enter into our initial business combination with another target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of proxy solicitation or tender offer materials that we would file with the SEC.\nInitial Business Combination\nThe rules\u00a0of the NYSE require that we must consummate our initial business combination with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting commissions held in trust) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201c\nFINRA\n\u201d) or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.\nIf we do not consummate the pending Business Combination with GBT, we may also pursue an acquisition opportunity jointly with our sponsor, Apollo, or one or more of its affiliates, one or more Apollo Funds and/or investors in the Apollo Funds, which we refer to as an \u201c\nAffiliated Joint Acquisition\n.\u201d Any such parties may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by issuing to such parties a class of equity or equity-linked securities. Any such issuance of equity or equity-linked securities would, on a fully diluted basis, reduce the\u00a0percentage ownership of our then-existing shareholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of our Class\u00a0B ordinary shares, issuances or deemed issuances of Class\u00a0A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities would result in an adjustment to the ratio at which Class\u00a0B ordinary shares will convert into Class\u00a0A ordinary shares such that our initial shareholders and their permitted transferees, if any, would retain their aggregate\u00a0percentage ownership at 20% of the sum of the total number of all ordinary shares outstanding upon completion of the Initial Public Offering plus all Class\u00a0A ordinary shares and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with the business combination (excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the business combination), unless the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding Class\u00a0B ordinary shares agree to waive such adjustment with respect to such issuance or deemed issuance at the time thereof. Neither our sponsor nor Apollo, nor any of their respective affiliates, have an obligation to make any such investment, and may compete with us for potential business combinations.\n13\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, including an Affiliated Joint Acquisition as described above. However, we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires an interest in the target sufficient for the post-transaction company not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201c\nInvestment Company Act\n\u201d). Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the NYSE\u2019s 80% of net assets test. If the initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for seeking shareholder approval or for purposes of a tender offer, as applicable.\nAfter consideration of the factors identified and discussed in the section of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus captioned \u201cAPSG\u2019s Board\u2019s Reasons for Approval of the Business Combination,\u201d including the financial analysis of GBT conducted by APSG and its advisors generally used to approve the transaction, our board of directors determined that GBT had a fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting commissions held in the trust account and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of execution of the Business Combination Agreement.\nSourcing of Potential Business Combination Targets\nCertain members of our management team and directors, including those who are affiliated with Apollo have fiduciary duties or are subject to contractual obligations or policies and procedures that require them to present business opportunities that may be appropriate for one or more entities, including Apollo Funds, to the respective investment committees of such entities or funds prior to presenting such opportunities to us regardless of the capacity in which they are made aware of such opportunities. This may impede our ability to acquire a target business that would be attractive to us. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for both us and another entity, including any Apollo entity, about which any member of our management team or director acquires knowledge and we will waive any claim or cause of action we may have in respect thereof. We cannot guarantee that any opportunity that would be suitable for us will not be pursued by another entity, including Apollo or an Apollo Fund, or that any opportunity that is passed upon by such other entity will be referred to us in a timely manner or at all.\nApollo, together with its clients, engages in a broad range of business activities and invests in a broad range of businesses and assets. Apollo takes into account interests of its affiliates, clients and each of their respective portfolio companies (including reputational interests, financial interests, confidentiality concerns, legal, regulatory, tax and any other interests or considerations that arise from time to time) when determining whether to pursue (or how to structure) a potential transaction or investment opportunity. As a result, it is possible that Apollo may choose not to refer a business opportunity to us or that members of our management or directors who are affiliated with Apollo may choose not to pursue an opportunity notwithstanding that such opportunity would be attractive to us due to the reputational, financial, confidentiality, legal, regulatory, tax and/or other interests or considerations of Apollo, its affiliates, its clients and their respective portfolio companies.\n14\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.\nAs discussed herein and in \u201cItem\u00a010. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\n\u2014\nConflicts of Interest,\u201d if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she is required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us.\nStatus as a Public Company\nWe believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer GBT, and if the pending Business Combination with GBT is not consummated, any other target businesses, an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their ordinary shares in the target business for Class\u00a0A ordinary shares (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.\nFurthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, GBT or if the pending Business Combination with GBT is not consummated, any other target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters\u2019 ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe such business would then have greater access to capital, an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders\u2019 interests and the ability to use its equity as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company\u2019s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.\nFinancial Position\nWith funds available for a business combination initially in the amount of up to $788,221,650, after payment of $28,588,350 of deferred underwriting commissions, before fees and expenses associated with our initial business combination, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt or leverage ratio. Because we are able to complete our business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.\nEffecting our Initial Business Combination\nWe are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our pending Business Combination with GBT using the sources discussed under \u201c\u2014GBT Business Combination.\u201d If the pending Business Combination with GBT is not consummated, we intend to effectuate any other initial business combination, using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.\n15\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIf our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.\nWe may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our trust account or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by applicable law, we would seek shareholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to issue securities or incur debt in connection with our initial business combination. We are not currently a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities, the incurrence of debt or otherwise.\nSelection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination\nOur initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of our assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or from an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.\nIn any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire an interest in the target sufficient for the post-transaction company not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be valued for purposes of the NYSE\u2019s 80% of net assets test. There is no basis for current investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our business combination.\nAfter consideration of the factors identified and discussed in the section of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus captioned \u201cAPSG\u2019s Board\u2019s Reasons for Approval of the Business Combination,\u201d including the financial analysis of GBT conducted by APSG and its advisors generally used to approve the transaction, our board of directors determined that GBT had a fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting commissions held in the trust account and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of execution of the Business Combination Agreement.\nTo the extent we effect our business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.\n16\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a disciplined due diligence review of issues that we deem important to validating a company\u2019s business quality and assessing growth and value creation opportunities, allowing our management team to price returns relative to potential risks appropriately. This review may encompass, among other things, research related to the company\u2019s industry, markets, products, services and competitors, meetings with incumbent management and employees, on-site visits and a review of financial and other information which will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction.\nIf the pending Business Combination with GBT is not consummated, the time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, will not be currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. The company may pay underwriting discounts and commissions, placement agent fees, initial purchaser fees or discounts, finder\u2019s fees, arrangement fees, commitment fees and transaction, structuring, consulting, advisory and management fees and similar fees or other compensation to Apollo, our sponsor, our directors, members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination.\nLack of Business Diversification\nFor an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. In addition, we intend to focus our search for an initial business combination in a single industry. By completing our business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:\n\u25cf\nsubject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and\n\u25cf\ncause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.\nLimited Ability to Evaluate the Target\u2019s Management Team\nAlthough we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business, including the management of GBT, when evaluating the desirability of effecting our business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business\u2019s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.\nWe cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.\nFollowing a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.\n17\n\n\nTable of Contents\nShareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve our Initial Business Combination\nIf the pending Business Combination with GBT is not consummated, we may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote in connection with another initial business combination, pursuant to the tender offer rules\u00a0of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons.\nUnder the NYSE\u2019s listing rules, shareholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:\n\u25cf\nwe issue (other than in a public offering for cash) ordinary shares that will either (a)\u00a0be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of Class\u00a0A ordinary shares then outstanding or (b)\u00a0have voting power equal to or in excess of 20% of the voting power then outstanding;\n\u25cf\nany of our directors, officers or substantial securityholders (as defined by the NYSE rules) has a 5% or greater interest, directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired and if the number of ordinary shares to be issued, or if the number of ordinary shares into which the securities may be convertible or exercisable, exceeds either (a)\u00a01% of the number of ordinary shares or 1% of the voting power outstanding before the issuance in the case of any of our directors and officers or (b)\u00a05% of the number of ordinary shares or 5% of the voting power outstanding before the issuance in the case of any substantial securityholders; or\n\u25cf\nthe issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control.\nOther than if effected by a merger under Companies Act (as amended) of the Cayman Islands (as the same may be amended from time to time, the \u201c\nCompanies Act\n\u201d), which would require the passing of a shareholders\u2019 special resolution, the Companies Act and Cayman Islands law do not currently require, and we are not aware of any other applicable law that will require, shareholder approval of our initial business combination.\nThe decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which shareholder approval is not required by law will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and legal reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nthe timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine shareholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek shareholder approval or doing so would place the company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the company;\n\u25cf\nthe expected cost of holding a shareholder vote;\n\u25cf\nthe risk that the shareholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination;\n\u25cf\nother time and budget constraints of the company; and\n\u25cf\nadditional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to shareholders.\n18\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPermitted Purchases of our Securities\nWe are seeking shareholder approval of our pending Business Combination with GBT. In the event that the pending Business Combination with GBT is not consummated and we conduct redemptions in connection with another proposed business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our initial shareholders, Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit on the number of shares our initial shareholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and the rules\u00a0of the NYSE. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such shareholder, although still the record holder of our shares, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights.\nIn the event that our initial shareholders, sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules\u00a0under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules\u00a0under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.\nThe purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to (i)\u00a0vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or (ii)\u00a0to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.\nIn addition, if such purchases are made, the public \u201cfloat\u201d of our ordinary shares or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.\nOur initial shareholders, sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom our initial shareholders, sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders (in the class of Class\u00a0A ordinary shares) following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such shareholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination but only if such shares have not already been voted at the shareholder meeting related to our initial business combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase shares from based on the negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant, and will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.\nAny purchases by our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule\u00a010b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule\u00a010b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section\u00a09(a)(2)\u00a0and Rule\u00a010b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule\u00a010b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of ordinary shares if the purchases would violate Section\u00a09(a)(2)\u00a0or Rule\u00a010b-5 of the Exchange Act. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section\u00a013 and Section\u00a016 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements.\n19\n\n\nTable of Contents\nRedemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination\nAs discussed in our Proxy Statement/Prospectus, we will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class\u00a0A ordinary shares in connection with our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business\u00a0days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us as permitted withdrawals, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein (such redemption, the \u201c\nAPSG Share Redemption\n\u201d). The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be approximately $10.00 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Class\u00a0B ordinary shares held by them and any public shares held by them in connection with our initial business combination (the \u201c\nletter agreement\n\u201d).\nLimitations on Redemptions\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that in no event will we redeem our Class A ordinary shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules). However, the proposed business combination may require (i)\u00a0cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii)\u00a0cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii)\u00a0the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class\u00a0A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class\u00a0A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.\nManner of Conducting Redemptions\nAs discussed in our Proxy Statement/Prospectus, we will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class\u00a0A ordinary shares either (i)\u00a0in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii)\u00a0by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our company and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would require shareholder approval. If we structure a business combination transaction with a target business in a manner that requires shareholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a shareholder vote to approve the proposed business combination. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote unless shareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement and we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules\u00a0of the SEC for business or other legal reasons.\nIf we hold a shareholder vote to approve our initial business combination, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:\n\u25cf\nconduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and\n\u25cf\nfile proxy materials with the SEC.\nIn the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above.\n20\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIf we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of our outstanding ordinary shares representing a majority of the voting power of all of our outstanding ordinary shares entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial shareholders will count toward this quorum and have agreed to vote their Class\u00a0B ordinary shares and any public shares purchased in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding ordinary shares voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, in addition to our initial shareholders\u2019 Class\u00a0B ordinary shares, we would need 30,630,376, or 37.5%, of the 81,681,000 public shares sold to be voted in favor of a transaction (assuming all outstanding shares are voted) in order to have our initial business combination approved. We intend to give approximately 30\u00a0days (but not less than 10\u00a0days nor more than 60\u00a0days) prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our initial business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial shareholders, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether it votes for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into the letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Class\u00a0B ordinary shares and any public shares held by them in connection with our initial business combination.\nIf we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules\u00a0of the SEC, we will:\n\u25cf\nconduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule\u00a013e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and\n\u25cf\nfile tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. Although we are not required to do so, we currently intend to comply with the substantive and procedural requirements of Regulation 14A in connection with any shareholder vote even if we are not able to maintain our NYSE listing or Exchange Act registration.\nUpon the public announcement of our business combination, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule\u00a010b5-1 to purchase our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule\u00a014e-5 under the Exchange Act.\nIn the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business\u00a0days, in accordance with Rule\u00a014e-1(a)\u00a0under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.\nLimitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Shareholder Approval\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup\u201d (as defined under Section\u00a013 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering, which we refer to as the \u201c\nExcess Shares\n.\u201d We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder\u2019s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders\u2019 ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders\u2019 ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our business combination.\n21\n\n\nTable of Contents\nTendering Stock Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights\nPublic shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d are required to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials (as applicable) mailed to such holders, or up to two business\u00a0days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the Depository Trust Company\u2019s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder\u2019s option. The proxy solicitation or tender offer materials (as applicable) that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate the applicable delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two\u00a0days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption rights, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.\nThere is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.\nAny request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the shareholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our business combination.\nIf our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.\nIf our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different during the remainder of the completion window (as defined below).\nRedemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that we have until 24\u00a0months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, or 27\u00a0months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering if we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for our initial business combination within 24\u00a0months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering but have not completed our initial business combination within such 24-month period (the \u201c\ncompletion window\n\u201d) to complete our initial business combination, including the pending Business Combination with GBT. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the completion window, we will: (i)\u00a0cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii)\u00a0as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business\u00a0days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to make permitted withdrawals (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders\u2019 rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii)\u00a0as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the completion window.\n22\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur sponsor, officers and directors have entered into the letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any Class\u00a0B ordinary shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the completion window. However, if our sponsor, officers or directors acquire public shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the completion window.\nOur sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A)\u00a0that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within the completion window or (B)\u00a0with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders\u2019 rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class\u00a0A ordinary shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to make permitted withdrawals, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. Pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, such an amendment would need to be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 65% of all then outstanding ordinary shares.\nWe expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from cash held outside of the trust account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose.\nHowever, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not used to make permitted withdrawals, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.\nIf we were to expend all of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors\u2019 claims.\n23\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAlthough we will seek to have all vendors (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party\u2019s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent public accountants) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i)\u00a0$10.00 per public share or (ii)\u00a0such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations, and we believe that our sponsor\u2019s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.\nIn the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (i)\u00a0$10.00 per public share or (ii)\u00a0such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations and we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per public share.\nWe will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have access to up to approximately $2,000,000 from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors.\n24\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIf we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a \u201cpreferential transfer\u201d or a \u201cfraudulent conveyance.\u201d As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.\nOur public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i)\u00a0in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the completion window, subject to applicable law, (ii)\u00a0in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A)\u00a0that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within the completion window or (B)\u00a0with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders\u2019 rights or pre-initial business combination activity (iii)\u00a0if they redeem their respective shares for cash in connection with our initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder\u2019s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder\u2019s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote.\nCertain Potential Conflicts of Interest\nUnder Cayman Islands law, directors owe fiduciary duties to the company including the following:\n\u25cf\nduty to act in good faith in what the director believes to be in the best interests of the company as a whole;\n\u25cf\nduty to exercise authority for the purpose for which it is conferred;\n\u25cf\ndirectors should not improperly fetter the exercise of future discretion;\n\u25cf\nduty not to put themselves in a position in which there is a conflict between their duty to the company and their personal interests; and\n\u25cf\nduty to exercise independent judgment.\nIn addition to the above, directors also owe a duty of care which is not fiduciary in nature. This duty has been defined as a requirement to act as a reasonably diligent person having both the general knowledge, skill and experience that may reasonably be expected of a person carrying out the same functions as are carried out by that director in relation to the company and the general knowledge skill and experience which that director has.\nAs set out above, directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position of conflict and this includes a duty not to engage in self-dealing, or to otherwise benefit as a result of their position. However, in some instances what would otherwise be a breach of this duty can be forgiven and/or authorized in advance by the shareholders provided that there is full disclosure by the directors. This can be done by way of permission granted in the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or alternatively by shareholder approval at general meetings.\n25\n\n\nTable of Contents\nEach of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Certain members of our management team and directors who are affiliated with Apollo have fiduciary duties or are subject to contractual obligations or policies and procedures that require them to present business opportunities that may be appropriate for one or more Apollo Funds to the respective investment committees of such funds prior to presenting such opportunities to us regardless of the capacity in which they are made aware of such opportunities. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity, including an Apollo entity, to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such other entity. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for both us and another entity, including any Apollo entity, about which any member of our management team or director acquires knowledge and we will waive any claim or cause of action we may have in respect thereof. In addition, we may pursue an Affiliated Joint Acquisition opportunity with an entity to which an officer or director has a fiduciary or contractual obligation. Any such entity may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by borrowing from or issuing to such entity a class of equity or equity-linked securities. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination.\nApollo manages a significant number of Apollo Funds. Apollo and its affiliates, as well as Apollo Funds, may compete with us for acquisition opportunities. If these entities or companies decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from procuring such opportunities. In addition, investment ideas generated within Apollo may be suitable for both us and for Apollo affiliates and/or current or future Apollo Funds and may be directed to such affiliates and/or Apollo Funds rather than to us. Neither Apollo nor members of our management team who are also employed by Apollo have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware. Apollo and/or our management, in their capacities as partners, officers or employees of Apollo will be, or in their other endeavors may be, required to present potential business combinations to other entities, before they present such opportunities to us.\nIn addition, Apollo and its affiliates and/or Apollo Funds, including our officers and directors who are affiliated with Apollo may sponsor or form other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination, and members of our management team may participate in such blank check companies. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target, particularly in the event there is overlap among the management teams.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, we may pursue an Affiliated Joint Acquisition opportunity with any affiliates of Apollo or investors in the Apollo Funds. In addition, we may pursue an Affiliated Joint Acquisition opportunity with an entity to which an officer or director has a fiduciary or contractual obligation. Such entities may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by borrowing from or issuing to such entity a class of equity or equity-linked securities.\nPotential investors should also be aware of the following other potential conflicts of interest:\n\u25cf\nNone of our officers or directors is required to commit his or her full time to our affairs and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating his or her time among various business activities.\n\u25cf\nIn the course of their other business activities, our officers and directors may become aware of investment and business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as the other entities with which they are affiliated. Our management may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.\n26\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u25cf\nOur initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Class\u00a0B ordinary shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination. Additionally, our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Class\u00a0B ordinary shares held by them if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the completion window. If we do not complete our initial business combination within such applicable time period, the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants held in the trust account will be used to fund the redemption of our public shares, and the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless. Furthermore, our initial shareholders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any Class\u00a0B ordinary shares held by them until one\u00a0year after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination or earlier if, subsequent to our initial business combination, (i)\u00a0the last sale price of our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading\u00a0days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150\u00a0days after our initial business combination or (ii)\u00a0we consummate a subsequent liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property. With certain limited exceptions, the Private Placement Warrants and the Class\u00a0A ordinary shares underlying such warrants will not be transferable, assignable or saleable until 30\u00a0days after the completion of our initial business combination. Since our sponsor and officers and directors may directly or indirectly own ordinary shares and warrants following the Initial Public Offering, our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination.\n\u25cf\nOur officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.\n\u25cf\nOur sponsor or any of its affiliates may make additional investments in the company in connection with our initial business combination, although our sponsor and their affiliates have no obligation to do so. Apollo and its affiliates and certain of the Apollo Funds engage in the business of originating, underwriting, syndicating, acquiring and trading loans and debt securities of corporate and other borrowers, and may provide or participate in any debt financing arrangement in connection with any acquisition, financing or disposition of any target business that we may make. If our sponsor or any of its affiliates elect to make additional investments or provide financing, such proposed transactions could influence our sponsor\u2019s motivation to complete our initial business combination.\n\u25cf\nOur sponsor, officers or directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a business combination and financing arrangements as we may obtain loans from our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or any of our officers or directors to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. Such warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period.\nThe conflicts described above may not be resolved in our favor.\nWe are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with Apollo, our sponsor, officers or directors or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or from an independent accounting firm that such initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.\nApollo, our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, may serve as a finder or provide other services for which they may be paid underwriting discounts and commissions, placement agent fees, initial purchaser fees or discounts, finder\u2019s fees, arrangement fees, commitment fees and transaction, structuring, consulting, advisory and management fees and similar fees by the company for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). Further, commencing on the date our securities are first listed on the NYSE, we pay an amount equal to $16,667 per\u00a0month, for up to 27\u00a0months, to our sponsor for office space, utilities, secretarial support and administrative services provided to us.\n27\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn the event that we submit our initial business combination to our public shareholders for a vote, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the initial business combination. Our initial shareholders have agreed to vote any Class\u00a0B ordinary shares held by them and any public shares purchased during or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination and our officers and directors have also agreed to vote any public shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of our initial business combination.\nSponsor Indemnity\nOur sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent public accountants) for services rendered or products sold to us, or by a prospective target business with which we have entered into a letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i)\u00a0$10.00 per public share or (ii)\u00a0such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn in permitted withdrawals. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor\u2019s only assets are securities of our company. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations. None of our officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.\nFacilities\nOur executive offices are located at 9 West 57th Street, 43rd Floor, New York, NY 10019, and our telephone number is (212) 515-3200. The cost for our use of this space is included in the $16,667 per\u00a0month, for up to 27\u00a0months, we pay to our Sponsor for office space, utilities, secretarial support and administrative services.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe currently have two officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that they will devote in any time period will vary based on the stage of the business combination process we are in.\nPeriodic Reporting and Financial Information\nOur Units, Class\u00a0A ordinary shares and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. The SEC maintains an internet site at http://www.sec.gov that contains such reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.\nWe will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials (as applicable) sent to shareholders. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\u201c\nGAAP\n\u201d), or reconciled to, GAAP, or the international accounting standards board (\u201c\nIFRS\n\u201d), depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201c\nPCAOB\n\u201d). These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules\u00a0and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that any applicable requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.\n28\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe are required to evaluate our internal control procedures beginning with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and to have our internal control procedures audited. GBT is not and any other target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.\nLegal Proceedings\nThere is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any members of our management team in their capacity as such.\n\u200b\n29\n\n\nTable of Contents", "item1a": ">Item\u00a01A.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the risks described below, you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties related to the pending Business Combination with GBT included in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, including the risks factors relating to GBT\u2019s business and industry, GBT\u2019s dependence on third parties, GBT\u2019s employee matters and growth, and GBT\u2019s intellectual property, information technology, data security and privacy, before making an investment decision. If any of the risks and uncertainties occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nSummary Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, risks associated with:\n\u25cf\nour officers and directors allocating their time to other businesses and potentially having conflicts of interest with our business or in approving our initial business combination;\n\u25cf\nbeing a company with no operating history and no revenues;\n\u25cf\nour ability to complete our initial business combination, including the pending Business Combination with GBT, including risks arising from the uncertainty resulting from the novel coronavirus (the \u201c\nCOVID\n-\n19\n\u201d) pandemic;\n\u25cf\nour public shareholders\u2019 ability to exercise redemption rights;\n\u25cf\nthe requirement that we complete our initial business combination within the completion window, including the pending Business Combination with GBT;\n\u25cf\nthe possibility that NYSE may delist our securities from trading on its exchange;\n\u25cf\nbeing declared an investment company under the Investment Company Act;\n\u25cf\ncomplying with changing laws and regulations;\n\u25cf\nthe performance of the prospective target business or businesses;\n\u25cf\nour ability to select an appropriate target business or businesses;\n\u25cf\nthe pool of prospective target businesses available to us and the ability of our officers and directors to generate a number of potential business combination opportunities;\n\u25cf\nthe issuance of additional Class A ordinary shares in connection with a business combination that may dilute the interest of our shareholders;\n\u25cf\nthe incentives to our sponsor, officers and directors to complete a business combination to avoid losing their entire investment in us if our initial business combination is not completed;\n\u25cf\nour success in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, our officers or directors following our initial business combination;\n\u25cf\nour ability to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination;\n30\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u25cf\nour ability to amend the terms of warrants in a manner that may be adverse to the holders of Acquiror Cayman Warrants;\n\u25cf\nour ability to redeem unexpired warrants prior to their exercise;\n\u25cf\nour public securities\u2019 potential liquidity and trading; and\n\u25cf\nprovisions in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and Cayman Islands law that may have the effect of inhibiting a takeover of us and discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers.\nRisks Relating to the Consummation of, or Inability to Consummate, an Initial Business Combination\nOur public shareholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our pending business combination, and even if we hold a shareholder vote, holders of our Class\u00a0B ordinary shares will participate in such vote, which means we may complete our initial business combination even though a majority of our public shareholders do not support that combination.\nWe will hold a shareholder vote to approve our pending Business Combination with GBT. However, if the pending Business Combination with GBT is not consummated, we may choose not to hold a shareholder vote to approve another potential initial business combination if such business combination would not require shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements. Except as required by applicable law or stock exchange requirement, the decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors, such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval. Even if we seek shareholder approval, the holders of our Class B ordinary shares will participate in the vote on such shareholder approval. Accordingly, we may complete our initial business combination even if holders of a majority of our outstanding public shares do not approve of the business combination we complete. Please see \u201cItem 1. Business\u2014Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve our Initial Business Combination\u201d for additional information.\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote in favor of such initial business combination, regardless of how our public shareholders vote.\nOur initial shareholders, officers and directors have agreed (and their permitted transferees will agree) to vote any Class\u00a0B ordinary shares and any Class A ordinary shares held by them in favor of the pending Business Combination with GBT or in favor of another target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination. As a result, in addition to our initial shareholders\u2019 Class\u00a0B ordinary shares, we would need 30,630,376, or 37.5%, of the 81,681,000 public shares sold in in the Initial Public Offering to be voted in favor of a transaction (assuming all issued and outstanding shares are voted and the option to purchase additional Units is not exercised) in order to have such initial business combination approved. We expect that our initial shareholders and their permitted transferees will own at least 20% of our outstanding ordinary shares at the time of any such shareholder vote. Accordingly, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, it is more likely that the necessary shareholder approval will be received than would be the case if our initial shareholders and their permitted transferees agreed to vote their Class\u00a0B ordinary shares in accordance with the majority of the votes cast by our public shareholders.\nYour only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination will be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your shares from us for cash, unless we seek shareholder approval of such business combination.\nAt the time of your investment in us, you will not be provided with an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of our initial business combination. Since our board of directors may complete a business combination without seeking shareholder approval, public shareholders may not have the right or opportunity to vote on the business combination, unless we seek such shareholder vote. Accordingly, if the pending Business Combination with GBT is not consummated, and we do not seek shareholder approval with respect to another potential initial business combination, your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding such business combination may be limited to exercising your redemption rights within the period of time (which will be at least 20 business\u00a0days) set forth in our tender offer documents mailed to our public shareholders in which we describe our initial business combination.\n31\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe ability of our public shareholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets, which may make it difficult for us to enter into a business combination with a target.\nWe may seek to enter into a business combination agreement with a prospective target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights, we would not be able to meet such closing condition and, as a result, would not be able to proceed with the business combination. In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. Consequently, if accepting all properly submitted redemption requests would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 or make us unable to satisfy a minimum cash condition as described above, we would not proceed with such redemption and the related business combination and may instead search for an alternate business combination. Prospective targets will be aware of these risks and, thus, may be reluctant to enter into a business combination transaction with us. If we are able to complete an initial business combination, the per share value of shares held by non-redeeming shareholders will reflect our obligation to pay the deferred underwriting commissions.\nThe ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure.\nAt the time we enter into an agreement for our initial business combination, we will not know how many shareholders may exercise their redemption rights, and therefore will need to structure the transaction based on our expectations as to the number of shares that will be submitted for redemption. If our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, we will need to reserve a portion of the cash in the trust account to meet such requirements, or arrange for third-party financing. In addition, if a larger number of shares are submitted for redemption than we initially expected, we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the trust account or arrange for third-party financing. Raising additional third-party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. Furthermore, this dilution would increase to the extent that the anti-dilution provision of the Class\u00a0B ordinary shares result in the issuance of Class\u00a0A ordinary shares on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the Class\u00a0B ordinary shares at the time of completion of our initial business combination. In addition, the amount of deferred underwriting commissions payable to the underwriters is not required to be adjusted for any shares that are redeemed in connection with our initial business combination. The above considerations may limit our ability to complete the most desirable business combination available to us or optimize our capital structure. The per-share amount we will distribute to shareholders who properly exercise their redemption rights will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions and after such redemptions, the amount held in trust will continue to reflect our obligation to pay the entire deferred underwriting commissions.\nThe ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares could increase the probability that our initial business combination will be unsuccessful and that you will have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem your shares.\nIf our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, the probability that our initial business combination will be unsuccessful is increased. If our initial business combination is unsuccessful, you will not receive your pro rata portion of the trust account until we liquidate the trust account. If you are in need of immediate liquidity, you could attempt to sell your shares in the open market; however, at such time our shares may trade at a discount to the pro rata amount per share in the trust account. In either situation, you may suffer a material loss on your investment or lose the benefit of funds expected in connection with our redemption until we liquidate, or you are able to sell your shares in the open market.\n32\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe requirement that we complete our initial business combination within the completion window may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination and may limit the time we have in which to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets, in particular as we approach our dissolution deadline, which could undermine our ability to complete our initial business combination on terms that would produce value for our shareholders.\nAny potential target business with which we enter into negotiations concerning a business combination will be aware that we must complete our initial business combination within the completion window, including the pending Business Combination with GBT. Consequently, such target business may obtain leverage over us in negotiating a business combination, knowing that if we do not complete our initial business combination with that particular target business, we may be unable to complete our initial business combination with any target business. This risk will increase as we get closer to the timeframe described above. In addition, we may have limited time to conduct due diligence and may enter into our initial business combination on terms that we would have rejected upon a more comprehensive investigation.\nWe may not be able to complete our initial business combination within the completion window, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our public shares and liquidate, in which case our public shareholders may receive only their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public shareholders, and our warrants will expire worthless.\nIf the pending Business Combination with GBT does not close, we may not be able to find another suitable target business and complete our initial business combination within the completion window. Our ability to complete our initial business combination may be negatively impacted by general market conditions, volatility in the capital and debt markets and the other risks described herein. If we have not completed our initial business combination within such time period, we will (i)\u00a0cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii)\u00a0as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business\u00a0days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to make permitted withdrawals (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders\u2019 rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii)\u00a0as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. In such case, our public shareholders may only receive $10.00 per share, and our warrants will expire worthless. In certain circumstances, our public shareholders may receive less than $10.00 per share on the redemption of their shares. See \u201c\n\u2014\nIf third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.00 per share.\u201d\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our initial shareholders, sponsor, directors, officers, advisors and their affiliates may elect to purchase shares or public warrants from public shareholders or public warrant holders, which may influence a vote on a proposed business combination and reduce the public \u201cfloat\u201d of our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares.\nIn connection with the pending Business Combination with GBT, our initial shareholders, sponsors, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or Acquiror Cayman Warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the consummation of the pending Business Combination with GBT, although they are under no obligation to do so. However, other than as expressly stated in our Proxy Statement/Prospectus, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions.\nIf the pending Business Combination with GBT is not consummated and if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our initial shareholders, sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants or a combination thereof in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination, although they are under no obligation to do so. There is no limit on the number of shares our initial shareholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and the rules\u00a0of the NYSE. However, other than as expressly stated herein, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions.\n33\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn the event that our initial shareholders, sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section\u00a013 and Section\u00a016 of the Exchange Act to the extent the purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. Please see \u201cItem\u00a01. Business\n\u2014\nPermitted Purchase of our Securities\u201d for a description of how our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase securities from in any private transaction.\nIn addition, if such purchases are made, the public \u201cfloat\u201d of our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares or public warrants and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, possibly making it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.\nIf a shareholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our public shares in connection with the pending Business Combination with GBT or a business combination with another target, or fails to comply with the procedures for tendering its shares, such shares may not be redeemed.\nWe will comply with the proxy rules\u00a0or tender offer rules, as applicable, when conducting redemptions in connection with our business combination. Despite our compliance with these rules, if a shareholder fails to receive our proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, such shareholder may not become aware of the opportunity to redeem its shares. In addition, the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will describe the various procedures that must be complied with in order to validly redeem or tender public shares. For example, we may require our public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials mailed to such holders, or up to two business\u00a0days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically. In the event that a shareholder fails to comply with these or any other procedures, its shares may not be redeemed. Please see \u201cItem\u00a01. Business\n\u2014\nTendering Stock Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights.\u201d\nYou will not have any rights or interests in funds from the trust account, except under certain limited circumstances. Therefore, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.\nOur public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earliest to occur of: (i)\u00a0the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with our initial business combination (including the release of funds to pay any amounts due to any public shareholders who properly exercise their redemption rights in connection therewith), (ii)\u00a0the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within the completion window, or (iii)\u00a0the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete an initial business combination within the completion window, subject to applicable law and as further described herein. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind in the trust account. Holders of warrants will not have any right to the proceeds held in the trust account with respect to the warrants. Accordingly, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.\n34\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIf you or a \u201cgroup\u201d of shareholders are deemed to hold in excess of 15% of our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares, you will lose the ability to redeem all such shares in excess of 15% of our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares.\nIn connection with the pending Business Combination with GBT or if the pending Business Combination with GBT is not consummated and if we seek shareholder approval of a business combination with another target and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with such initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup\u201d (as defined under Section\u00a013 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering without our prior consent, which we refer to as the \u201cExcess Shares.\u201d However, we would not be restricting our shareholders\u2019 ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. Your inability to redeem the Excess Shares will reduce your influence over our ability to complete our initial business combination and you could suffer a material loss on your investment in us if you sell Excess Shares in open market transactions. Additionally, you will not receive redemption distributions with respect to the Excess Shares if we complete our initial business combination. And as a result, you will continue to hold that number of shares exceeding 15% and, in order to dispose of such shares, would be required to sell your shares in open market transactions, potentially at a loss.\nBecause of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public shareholders may receive only their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public shareholders, and our warrants will expire worthless.\nIf we succeed in effecting the pending Business Combination with GBT, there will likely be significant competition from GBT\u2019s competitors. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to the pending Business Combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively. In the event that the pending Business Combination with GBT is not consummated, we expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, we are obligated to offer holders of our public shares the right to redeem their shares for cash at the time of our initial business combination, in conjunction with a shareholder vote or via a tender offer. Target businesses will be aware that this may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public shareholders may receive only their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public shareholders, and our warrants will expire worthless. In certain circumstances, our public shareholders may receive less than $10.00 per share upon our liquidation. See \u201c\n\u2014\nIf third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.00 per share\u201d and other risk factors below.\n35\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIf the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants not being held in the trust account are insufficient to allow us to operate for at least the duration of the completion window, we may be unable to complete our initial business combination, in which case our public shareholders may only receive $10.00 per share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, and our warrants will expire worthless.\nThe funds available to us outside of the trust account may not be sufficient to allow us to operate for at least the duration of the completion window, assuming that our initial business combination is not completed during that time. We believe that the funds available to us outside of the trust account, including permitted withdrawals and loans or additional investments from our sponsor, will be sufficient to allow us to operate for at least the duration of the completion window; however, we cannot assure you that our estimate is accurate. Of the funds available to us, we could use a portion of the funds available to us to pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business. We could also use a portion of the funds as a down payment or to fund a \u201cno-shop\u201d provision (a provision in letters of intent or merger agreements designed to keep target businesses from \u201cshopping\u201d around for transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into a letter of intent or merger agreement where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business and were subsequently required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise), we might not have sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conduct due diligence with respect to, a target business. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. In certain circumstances, our public shareholders may receive less than $10.00 per share upon our liquidation. See \u201c\n\u2014\nIf third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.00 per share\u201d and other risk factors below.\nIf the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants not being held in the trust account are insufficient to allow us to operate for at least the duration of the completion window, it could limit the amount available to fund our search for a target business or businesses and complete our initial business combination and we will depend on loans from our sponsor or management team to fund our search for a business combination, to make permitted withdrawals and to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to obtain these loans, we may be unable to complete our initial business combination.\nOf the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, as of December\u00a031, 2021, only approximately $161,277 was available to us outside the trust account to fund our working capital requirements. The amount held in the trust account will not be impacted as a result of such increase or decrease. If our other sources of working capital are insufficient, we will depend on loans from our sponsor or management team or a third party to fund our search, to pay our taxes and to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to obtain such loans, it could limit the amount available to fund our search for a target business and we may be unable to complete our initial business combination. We could also be forced to liquidate. None of our sponsor, members of our management team nor any of their affiliates is under any obligation to advance funds to us in such circumstances. Any such advances would be repaid only from funds held outside the trust account or from funds released to us upon completion of our initial business combination. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-business combination entity at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. Consequently, our public shareholders may only receive an estimated $10.00 per share, or possibly less, on our redemption of our public shares, and our warrants will expire worthless. See \u201c\n\u2014\nIf third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.00 per share\u201d and other risk factors below.\n36\n\n\nTable of Contents\nSubsequent to our completion of our initial business combination, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our stock price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nEven if we conduct extensive due diligence on a target business with which we combine, including GBT, we cannot assure you that this diligence will surface all material issues in relation to a particular target business, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of the target business and outside of our control will not later arise. As a result of these factors, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming pre-existing debt held by a target business or by virtue of our obtaining post-combination debt financing. Accordingly, any shareholders who choose to remain shareholders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such shareholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, relating to the business combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete our business combination.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, our activities may be restricted, including:\n\u25cf\nrestrictions on the nature of our investments; and\n\u25cf\nrestrictions on the issuance of securities, each of which may make it difficult for us to complete our business combination.\nIn addition, we may have imposed upon us burdensome requirements, including:\n\u25cf\nregistration as an investment company;\n\u25cf\nadoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and\n\u25cf\nreporting, record keeping, voting, proxy and disclosure requirements and other rules\u00a0and regulations.\nIn order not to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, unless we can qualify for an exclusion, we must ensure that we are engaged primarily in a business other than investing, reinvesting or trading of securities and that our activities do not include investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading \u201cinvestment securities\u201d constituting more than 40% of our assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Our business will be to identify and complete a business combination and thereafter to operate the post-transaction business or assets for the long term. We do not plan to buy businesses or assets with a view to resale or profit from their resale. We do not plan to buy unrelated businesses or assets or to be a passive investor.\n37\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to the Investment Company Act. To this end, the proceeds held in the trust account may only be invested in United States \u201cgovernment securities\u201d within the meaning of Section\u00a02(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 185\u00a0days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule\u00a02a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Pursuant to the trust agreement, the trustee is not permitted to invest in other securities or assets. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, and by having a business plan targeted at acquiring and growing businesses for the long term (rather than on buying and selling businesses in the manner of a merchant bank or private equity fund), we intend to avoid being deemed an \u201cinvestment company\u201d within the meaning of the Investment Company Act. Our shares are not intended for persons who are seeking a return on investments in government securities or investment securities. The trust account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earliest to occur of: (i)\u00a0the completion of our initial business combination; (ii)\u00a0the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within the completion window; or (iii)\u00a0the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the completion window, subject to applicable law. If we do not invest the proceeds as discussed above, we may be deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act. If we were deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expenses for which we have not allotted funds and may hinder our ability to complete a business combination, or may result in our liquidation. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public shareholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public shareholders, and our warrants will expire worthless.\nOur directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of our sponsor, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public shareholders.\nIn the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i)\u00a0$10.00 per public share and (ii)\u00a0the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations.\nWhile we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment and subject to their fiduciary duties may choose not to do so in any particular instance. If our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public shareholders may be reduced below $10.00 per share.\nIf third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.00 per share.\nOur placing of funds in the trust account may not protect those funds from third-party claims against us. Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, such parties may not execute such agreements, or even if they execute such agreements, they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party\u2019s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Making such a request of potential target businesses may make our acquisition proposal less attractive to them and, to the extent prospective target businesses refuse to execute such a waiver, it may limit the field of potential target businesses that we might pursue.\n38\n\n\nTable of Contents\nExamples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed timeframe, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10\u00a0years following redemption. Accordingly, the per-share redemption amount received by public shareholders could be less than the $10.00 per public share initially held in the trust account, due to claims of such creditors. Pursuant to the letter agreement, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent public accountants) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of (i)\u00a0$10.00 per public share and (ii)\u00a0the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsor\u2019s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.\nIf, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the members of our board of directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby exposing the members of our board of directors and us to claims of punitive damages.\nIf, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a \u201cpreferential transfer\u201d or a \u201cfraudulent conveyance.\u201d As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. In addition, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors.\nIf, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the claims of creditors in such proceeding may have priority over the claims of our shareholders and the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our shareholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced.\nIf, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our shareholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced.\n39\n\n\nTable of Contents\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, we are required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results of operations.\nOur ability to consummate a business combination, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak.\nOn March\u00a011, 2020, the World Health Organization officially declared the outbreak of the COVID-19 a \u201cpandemic.\u201d A significant outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in a widespread health crisis that adversely affected the economies and financial markets worldwide, and could potentially adversely affect the business of any potential target business with which we consummate a business combination. Furthermore, we may be unable to complete a business combination if continued concerns relating to COVID-19 restrict travel, limit the ability to have meetings with potential investors or the target company\u2019s personnel, vendors and services providers are unavailable to negotiate and consummate a transaction in a timely manner. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our ability to consummate a business combination depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. If the disruptions posed by COVID-19 or other matters of global concern continue for an extensive period of time, our ability to consummate a business combination, or the operations of GBT or another target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected.\nBecause we are not limited to a particular industry, sector or any specific target businesses with which to pursue our initial business combination, you will be unable to ascertain the merits or risks of any particular target business\u2019s operations.\nIn the event that the pending Business Combination with GBT is not consummated, we may seek to complete a business combination with an operating company in any industry, sector or location. However, we are not, under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations. To the extent we complete our initial business combination, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations with which we combine. For example, if we combine with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of sales or earnings, we may be affected by the risks inherent in the business and operations of a financially unstable or a development stage entity. Although our officers and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors or that we will have adequate time to complete due diligence. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our securities will ultimately prove to be more favorable to investors than a direct investment, if such opportunity were available, in a business combination target. Accordingly, any securityholders who choose to remain securityholders following our initial business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such securityholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value of their securities.\nWe may seek acquisition opportunities in industries or sectors that may be outside of our management\u2019s areas of expertise.\nWe may consider a business combination outside of our management\u2019s areas of expertise if a business combination candidate is presented to us and we determine that such candidate offers an attractive acquisition opportunity for our company. In the event we elect to pursue an acquisition outside of the areas of our management\u2019s expertise, our management\u2019s expertise may not be directly applicable to its evaluation or operation, and the information contained in this annual report regarding the areas of our management\u2019s expertise would not be relevant to an understanding of the business that we elect to acquire. As a result, our management may not be able to adequately ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors related to such acquisition. Accordingly, any securityholders who choose to remain securityholders following our initial business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such securityholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value.\n40\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAlthough we have identified general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses, we may enter into our initial business combination with a target that does not meet such criteria and guidelines, and as a result, the target business with which we enter into our initial business combination may not have attributes entirely consistent with our general criteria and guidelines.\nAlthough we have identified general criteria and guidelines for evaluating prospective target businesses, it is possible that a target business with which we enter into our initial business combination will not have all of these positive attributes. If we complete our initial business combination with a target that does not meet some or all of these guidelines, such combination may not be as successful as a combination with a business that does meet all of our general criteria and guidelines. In addition, if we announce a prospective business combination with a target that does not meet our general criteria and guidelines, a greater number of shareholders may exercise their redemption rights, which may make it difficult for us to meet any closing condition with a target business that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. In addition, if shareholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or we decide to obtain shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons, it may be more difficult for us to attain shareholder approval of our initial business combination if the target business does not meet our general criteria and guidelines. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public shareholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public shareholders, and our warrants will expire worthless.\nWe may seek business combination opportunities with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of revenue or earnings, which could subject us to volatile revenues, cash flows or earnings or difficulty in retaining key personnel.\nTo the extent we complete our initial business combination with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of revenues, cash flows or earnings, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the operations of the business with which we combine. These risks include volatile revenues, cash flows or earnings and difficulties in obtaining and retaining key personnel. Although our officers and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we may not be able to properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors and we may not have adequate time to complete due diligence. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business.\nWe may issue additional ordinary shares or preferred shares to complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan after completion of our initial business combination. We may also issue Class\u00a0A ordinary shares upon the conversion of the Class\u00a0B ordinary shares at a ratio greater than one-to-one at the time of completion of our initial business combination as a result of the anti-dilution provisions contained in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. Any such issuances would dilute the interest of our shareholders and likely present other risks.\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association authorizes the issuance of up to 300,000,000 Class\u00a0A ordinary shares, par value $0.00005 per share, 60,000,000 Class\u00a0B ordinary shares, par value $0.00005 per share, and 1,000,000 undesignated preferred shares, par value $0.00005 per share. As of December\u00a031, 2021, there were 218,319,000 and 39,579,750 authorized but unissued Class\u00a0A ordinary shares and Class\u00a0B ordinary shares, respectively, available for issuance, which amount does not take into account Class\u00a0A ordinary shares reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding warrants, or shares issuable upon conversion of Class\u00a0B ordinary shares. Our Class\u00a0B ordinary shares are automatically convertible into Class\u00a0A ordinary shares at the time of completion of our initial business combination, initially at a one-for-one ratio but subject to adjustment as set forth herein. As of December\u00a031, 2021, there were no preferred shares issued and outstanding. Our Class\u00a0B ordinary shares are convertible into Class\u00a0A ordinary shares initially at a one-for-one ratio but subject to adjustment as set forth herein, including in certain circumstances in which we issue Class\u00a0A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities related to our initial business combination.\n41\n\n\nTable of Contents\nDue to additional ordinary share issuances, if the pending Business Combination with GBT is consummated, our shareholders will experience dilution. If the pending Business Combination with GBT is not consummated, we may issue a substantial number of additional ordinary shares or preferred shares to complete another proposed initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan after completion of our initial business combination. We may also issue Class A ordinary shares upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares at a ratio greater than one-to-one at the time of completion of our initial business combination as a result of the anti-dilution provisions contained in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides, among other things, that prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional ordinary shares that would entitle the holders thereof to (i)\u00a0receive funds from the trust account or (ii)\u00a0vote on any initial business combination. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote. The issuance of additional ordinary shares or preferred shares:\n\u25cf\nmay significantly dilute the equity interest of investors;\n\u25cf\nmay subordinate the rights of holders of ordinary shares if preferred shares are issued with rights senior to those afforded our ordinary shares;\n\u25cf\ncould cause a change in control if a substantial number of our ordinary shares are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and\n\u25cf\nmay adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Units, Class\u00a0A ordinary shares and/or warrants.\nWe are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or from an independent accounting firm, and consequently, you may have no assurance from an independent source that the price we are paying for the business is fair to our company from a financial point of view.\nUnless we complete our business combination with an affiliated entity, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or from an independent accounting firm that the price we are paying is fair to our company from a financial point of view. If no opinion is obtained, our shareholders will be relying on the judgment of our board of directors, who will determine fair market value based on standards generally accepted by the financial community. Such standards used will be disclosed in our proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, related to our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm. However, our shareholders may not be provided with a copy of such opinion, nor will they be able to rely on such opinion.\nResources could be wasted in researching business combinations that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public shareholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public shareholders, and our warrants will expire worthless.\nWe anticipate that the investigation of each specific target business and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys, consultants and others. If we decide not to complete a specific initial business combination, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore, if we reach an agreement relating to a specific target business, we may fail to complete our initial business combination for any number of reasons including those beyond our control. Any such event will result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public shareholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public shareholders, and our warrants will expire worthless.\n42\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur current officers may not remain in their positions following our business combination. We may have a limited ability to assess the management of a prospective target business and, as a result, may effect our initial business combination with a target business whose management may not have the skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company, which could, in turn, negatively impact the value of our shareholders\u2019 investment in us.\nWhen evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with a prospective target business, our ability to assess the target business\u2019s management may be limited due to a lack of time, resources or information. Our assessment of the capabilities of the target business\u2019s management, therefore, may prove to be incorrect and such management may lack the skills, qualifications or abilities we suspected. Should the target business\u2019s management not possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to manage a public company, the operations and profitability of the post-combination business may be negatively impacted. Accordingly, any shareholders who choose to remain shareholders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such shareholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials (as applicable) relating to the business combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission.\nThe officers and directors of an acquisition candidate may resign upon completion of our initial business combination. The loss of a business combination target\u2019s key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business.\nThe role of an acquisition candidate\u2019s key personnel upon the completion of our initial business combination cannot be ascertained at this time. Although we contemplate that certain members of an acquisition candidate\u2019s management team will remain associated with the acquisition candidate following our initial business combination, it is possible that members of the management of an acquisition candidate will not wish to remain in place.\nWe may only be able to complete one business combination with the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, which will cause us to be solely dependent on a single business which may have a limited number of products or services. This lack of diversification may negatively impact our operations and profitability.\nThe net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants provided us with $816,810,000 (that we may use to complete our initial business combination (which includes $28,588,350 of deferred underwriting commissions being held in the trust account)).\nWe may effectuate our initial business combination with a single target business or multiple target businesses simultaneously or within a short period of time. However, we may not be able to effectuate our initial business combination with more than one target business because of various factors, including the existence of complex accounting issues and the requirement that we prepare and file pro forma financial statements with the SEC that present operating results, and the financial condition of several target businesses as if they had been operated on a combined basis. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments. Further, we would not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry. Accordingly, the prospects for our success may be:\n\u25cf\nsolely dependent upon the performance of a single business, property or asset, or\n\u25cf\ndependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.\nThis lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our business combination.\n43\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe may attempt to simultaneously complete business combinations with multiple prospective targets, which may hinder our ability to complete our initial business combination and give rise to increased costs and risks that could negatively impact our operations and profitability.\nIf we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses that are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete our initial business combination. With multiple business combinations, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business. If we are unable to adequately address these risks, it could negatively impact our profitability and results of operations.\nWe may attempt to complete our initial business combination with a private company about which little information is available, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all.\nIn pursuing our business combination strategy, we may seek to effectuate our initial business combination with a privately held company such as GBT. Very little public information generally exists about private companies, and we could be required to make our decision on whether to pursue a potential initial business combination on the basis of limited information, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all.\nOur management may not be able to maintain control of a target business after our initial business combination. We cannot provide assurance that, upon loss of control of a target business, new management will possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business.\nWe may structure a business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires an interest in the target sufficient for the post-transaction company not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We will not consider any transaction that does not meet such criteria. Even if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than a majority of our outstanding ordinary shares subsequent to such transaction. In addition, other minority shareholders may subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the company\u2019s stock than we initially acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely that our management will not be able to maintain control of the target business.\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association requires the affirmative vote of a majority of our board of directors, to approve our initial business combination, which may have the effect of delaying or preventing a business combination that our public shareholders would consider favorable.\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association requires the affirmative vote of a majority of our board of directors. Accordingly, it is unlikely that we will be able to enter into an initial business combination unless our sponsor\u2019s members find the target and the business combination attractive. This may make it more difficult for us to approve and enter into an initial business combination than other blank check companies and could result in us not pursuing an acquisition target or other board or corporate action that our public shareholders would find favorable.\n44\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn order to effectuate our initial business combination, we may seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or other governing instruments in a manner that will make it easier for us to complete our initial business combination but that some of our shareholders or warrant holders may not support.\nIn order to effectuate a business combination, blank check companies have, in the past, amended various provisions of their constitutional documents and modified governing instruments. For example, blank check companies have amended the definition of business combination, increased redemption thresholds and changed industry focus. We cannot assure you that we will not seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or governing instruments in order to effectuate our initial business combination though amending our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association requires at least a special resolution of our shareholders as a matter of Cayman Islands law.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that relate to our pre-business combination activity (and corresponding provisions of the agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account) may be amended with the approval of holders of at least two-thirds of our ordinary shares who attend and vote in a general meeting, which is a lower amendment threshold than that of some other blank check companies. It may be easier for us, therefore, to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and the trust agreement to facilitate the completion of an initial business combination that some of our shareholders may not support.\nSome other blank check companies have a provision in their constitutional documents which prohibits the amendment of certain of its constitutional provisions, including those which relate to a company\u2019s pre-business combination activity, without approval by holders of a certain\u00a0percentage of the company\u2019s shares. In those companies, amendment of these provisions typically requires approval by holders holding between 90% and 100% of the company\u2019s public shares. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that any of its provisions, including those related to pre-business combination activity (including the requirement to deposit proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement Warrants into the trust account and not release such amounts except in specified circumstances, and to provide redemption rights to public shareholders, as described herein), but excluding the provisions of the articles relating to the election or removal of directors and continuation of the company in a jurisdiction outside the Cayman Islands, may be amended if approved by holders of at least two-thirds of our ordinary shares who attend and vote in a general meeting, and corresponding provisions of the trust agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our ordinary shares. Our initial shareholders, who collectively beneficially own 20% of our ordinary shares as of the date of this annual report, may participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and/or trust agreement and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. As a result, we may be able to amend the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association which governs our pre-business combination behavior more easily than some other blank check companies, and this may increase our ability to complete a business combination with which you do not agree. Our shareholders may pursue remedies against us for any breach of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association.\nOur sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within the completion window, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to make permitted withdrawals, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. These agreements are contained in the letter agreement, that we have entered into with our sponsor, officers and directors. Our shareholders are not parties to, or third-party beneficiaries of, these agreements and, as a result, will not have the ability to pursue remedies against our sponsor, officers or directors for any breach of these agreements. As a result, in the event of a breach, our shareholders would need to pursue a shareholder derivative action, subject to applicable law.\n45\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe may be unable to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination or to fund the operations and growth of a target business, which could compel us to restructure or abandon a particular business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public shareholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public shareholders, and our warrants will expire worthless.\nIf the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants prove to be insufficient for our initial business combination, either because of the size of our initial business combination, the depletion of the available net proceeds in search of a target business, the obligation to redeem for cash a significant number of shares from shareholders who elect redemption in connection with our initial business combination or the terms of negotiated transactions to purchase shares in connection with our initial business combination, we may be required to seek additional financing or to abandon the proposed business combination. We cannot assure you that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. To the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to complete our initial business combination, we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that particular business combination and seek an alternative target business candidate. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public shareholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public shareholders, and our warrants will expire worthless. In addition, even if we do not need additional financing to complete our business combination, we may require such financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business. None of our officers, directors or shareholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our business combination.\nThe securities in the trust account could bear a negative rate of interest, which could reduce the value of the assets held in trust such that the per-share redemption amount received by public shareholders may be less than $10.00 per share.\nThe proceeds held in the trust account are invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185\u00a0days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule\u00a02a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. While short-term U.S. government treasury obligations currently yield a positive rate of interest, they have briefly yielded negative interest rates in recent\u00a0years. Central banks in Europe and Japan pursued interest rates below zero in recent\u00a0years, and the Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve has not ruled out the possibility that it may in the future adopt similar policies in the United States. In the event that we are unable to complete our initial business combination or make certain amendments to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, our public shareholders are entitled to receive their pro-rata share of the proceeds held in the trust account, plus any interest income not released to us, net of taxes payable. Negative interest rates could impact the per-share redemption amount that may be received by public shareholders. In addition, we are allowed to remove permitted withdrawals to pay our taxes; this means that even with a positive interest rate, most or all of the interest income may be withdrawn by us and not be available to fund our business combination or to be returned to investors upon a redemption.\nWe may reincorporate in another jurisdiction in connection with our initial business combination, in which case the laws of such jurisdiction would govern some or all of our future material agreements, and we may not be able to enforce our legal rights.\nIf the pending Business Combination with GBT is consummated, we will, and if we consummate an initial business combination with another target, we may, relocate the home jurisdiction of our business from the Cayman Islands to another jurisdiction. If we determine to do this, the laws of such jurisdiction may govern some or all of our future material agreements. The system of laws and the enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdiction may not be as certain in implementation and interpretation as in the United States. The inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under any of our future agreements could result in a significant loss of business, business opportunities or capital.\n46\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur warrants included in the units, our private placement warrants and any warrants issued to our sponsor upon conversion of loans will be accounted for as a liability and any change in value will be required to be reflected in quarterly and annual financial statements, which may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares or may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination.\nOn April 12, 2021, the Acting Director of the Division of Corporation Finance and Acting Chief Accountant of the SEC (the \u201c\nSEC Staff\n\u201d) issued together issued a statement regarding the accounting and reporting considerations for warrants issued by special purpose acquisition companies (\u201c\nSPAC\n\u201d) entitled \u201cStaff Statement on Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Warrants Issued by Special Purpose Acquisition Companies\u201d (the \u201c\nStaff Statement\n\u201d). In the Staff Statement, the SEC Staff expressed its view that certain terms and conditions common to warrants included in units and private placement warrants may result in the classification of these financial instruments as a liability as opposed to equity. We reviewed the Staff Statement and have been accounting for the 39,451,134 warrants issued in connection with our Initial Public Offering (including the 27,227,000 Acquiror Cayman Warrants in the Initial Public Offering and the 12,224,134 Private Placement Warrants) and any warrants issued to our Sponsor upon conversion of loans in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40 \u201cDerivatives and Hedging \u2014 Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity\u201d (ASC 815-40). Such guidance provides that because the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder, each warrant must be recorded as a liability. Accordingly, we classify each warrant as a liability at its fair value. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date. With each such re-measurement, the warrant liability will be adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in our statement of operations and therefore our reported earnings. The impact of changes in fair value on earnings may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A ordinary shares. In addition, potential targets may seek a SPAC that does not have warrants that are accounted for as a warrant liability, which may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination with a target business.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December\u00a031, 2021 solely related to our accounting for complex financial instruments. If we are unable to develop and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nFollowing the issuance of the Staff Statement and the conclusion that the classification of $5,000,001 in permanent equity was not appropriate and that the public shares should be reclassified as temporary equity, our management concluded that, a material weakness exists in our internal controls over financial reporting, solely related to our accounting for complex financial instruments.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. We continue to evaluate steps to remediate the material weakness. These remediation measures may be time consuming and costly and there is no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects.\nIf we identify any new material weakness in the future, any such newly identified material weakness could limit our ability to prevent or detect a misstatement of our accounts or disclosures that could result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements. In such case, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports in addition to applicable stock exchange listing requirements, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and our stock price may decline as a result. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, or any measures we may take in the future, will be sufficient to avoid potential future material weaknesses.\n47\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe, and following our initial business combination, the post-business combination company, may face litigation and other risks as a result of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.\nAs a result of the material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting described above, the change in accounting for the warrants, and other matters raised or that may in the future be raised by the SEC, we face potential for litigation or other disputes which may include, among others, claims invoking the federal and state securities laws, contractual claims or other claims arising from the material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements. As of the date of this annual report, we have no knowledge of any such litigation or dispute. However, we can provide no assurance that such litigation or dispute will not arise in the future. Any such litigation or dispute, whether successful or not, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or our ability to complete an initial business combination.\nAs the number of special purpose acquisition companies evaluating targets increases, attractive targets may become scarcer and there may be more competition for attractive targets. This could increase the cost of our initial business combination and could even result in our inability to find a target or to consummate an initial business combination.\nIn recent\u00a0years, the number of SPACs that have been formed has increased substantially. Many potential targets for SPACs have already entered into an initial business combination, and there are still many special purpose acquisition companies seeking targets for their initial business combination, as well as many such companies currently in registration. As a result, at times, fewer attractive targets may be available, and in the event our pending Business Combination with GBT is not consummated, it may require more time, more effort and more resources to identify another suitable target and to consummate an initial business combination. In addition, because there are more special purpose acquisition companies seeking to enter into an initial business combination with available targets, the competition for available targets with attractive fundamentals or business models may increase, which could cause targets companies to demand improved financial terms. Attractive deals could also become scarcer for other reasons, such as economic or industry sector downturns, geopolitical tensions, or increases in the cost of additional capital needed to close business combinations or operate targets post-business combination. This could increase the cost of, delay or otherwise complicate or frustrate our ability to find and consummate an initial business combination, and may result in our inability to consummate an initial business combination on terms favorable to our investors altogether.\nRisks Relating to the Pending Business Combination with GBT\nThe pending Business Combination with GBT may not be completed on the anticipated terms and there are uncertainties and risks related to consummating the pending Business Combination with GBT.\nOn December 2, 2021, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement with GBT, pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Business Combination Agreement, GBT will become our direct subsidiary, with us being renamed \u201cGlobal Business Travel Group, Inc.\u201d and conducting its business through GBT in an umbrella partnership-C corporation structure.\n48\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe Closing may not be completed on the anticipated terms and there are uncertainties and risks related to consummating the Business Combination. The Closing is subject to certain conditions, including, among other things, (i) that the approval of the Shareholder Proposals (other than any separate or unbundled advisory proposals as are required to implement the Domestication or the changes to APSG\u2019s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association) has been obtained; (ii) the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act (which expired at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on January 18, 2022) and receipt of approval from (or a notification or final notification that no further action will be taken by) the U.K. Secretary of State pursuant to the NSIA (including a notification by the U.K. Secretary of State that no further action will be taken in relation to the transaction, or final notification by the U.K. Secretary of State that no further action will be taken by the NSIA in relation to a call-in notice in respect of the transaction) (which was received on February 23, 2022); (iii) that the amount of available cash at Closing, including the amount in our trust account (net of APSG Share Redemption), our cash on hand (outside the trust account) and the aggregate gross purchase price received by APSG in connection with the PIPE Investment, is at least $300 million (which is only a condition in favor of GBT, but cannot be waived without the prior written consent of APSG (such consent to not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)); (iv) satisfaction of covenant and representation and warranty bring-down conditions and receipt of certificates from each party certifying the satisfaction of such conditions; (v) the absence of any law or order that would prohibit or make illegal the Transactions; (vi) the absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect or an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect (as each is defined in the Business Combination Agreement); (vii) the approval of the listing of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange; (viii) the effectiveness of the Domestication; (ix) APSG\u2019s net tangible assets not being less than $5,000,001; and (x) the effectiveness of the Registration Statement. To the extent permitted by law (and subject to the limitation described in clause (iii) above), the conditions in the Business Combination Agreement may be waived by the parties.\nAn active trading market for the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock may never develop or be sustained, which may cause shares of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock to trade at a discount to the price implied by the Business Combination and make it difficult to sell shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock.\nWe expect to list the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock on the NYSE under the symbol \u201cGBTG.\u201d However, we cannot assure you that an active trading market for the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock will develop on that exchange or elsewhere or, if developed, that any market will be sustained. Accordingly, we cannot assure you of the likelihood that an active trading market for the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock will develop or be maintained, the liquidity of any trading market, your ability to sell your shares of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock when desired or the prices that you may obtain for your shares. Additionally, the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock likely will not be eligible to be included in certain stock indices because of our dual class voting structure. For example, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple-class share structures in certain of their indexes. S&P, Dow Jones and FTSE Russell have each announced changes to their eligibility criteria for inclusion of shares of public companies on certain indices, including the S&P 500. These changes exclude companies with multiple classes of shares from being added to these indices.\nThe market price of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could cause the value of your investment to decline.\nThe trading price of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock following the Business Combination is likely to be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock include the following:\n\u25cf\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u25cf\nvolatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of travel industry stocks;\n\u25cf\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other travel companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n\u25cf\nsales of shares of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock by stockholders or by us;\n49\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u25cf\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u25cf\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections or our failure to meet those projections;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new offerings or platform features;\n\u25cf\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u25cf\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u25cf\nthe COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the travel industry;\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors\u2019 businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\n\u25cf\nlitigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses, services or technologies by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u25cf\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles;\n\u25cf\nany significant change in our management;\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets; and\n\u25cf\nother factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they publish negative evaluations of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock, the market price and trading volume of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock could decline.\nThe trading market for the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock will rely, in part, on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not currently have, and may never obtain, research coverage by industry or financial analysts. If no, or few, analysts commence coverage of us, the trading price of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock would likely decrease. Even if we do obtain analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts covering our business downgrade their evaluations of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock, the price of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock, we could lose visibility in the market for the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\n50\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could harm us.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting. Internal controls over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Under standards established by the PCAOB, a deficiency in internal controls over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or personnel, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. The PCAOB defines a material weakness as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. The PCAOB defines a significant deficiency as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of a registrant\u2019s financial reporting. We cannot assure you that material weaknesses and control deficiencies will not be discovered in the future. Our failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our business and could cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements, which could cause a decline in the price of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock, and we may be unable to maintain compliance with the NYSE listing standards.\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares are restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market in the near future. This could cause the market price of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock to drop significantly, even if PubCo\u2019s business is doing well.\nThe sale of substantial amounts of shares of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of the shares of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. Upon consummation of the Business Combination, the PIPE Investors will own 33.5 million of the outstanding shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock sold to the PIPE Investors pursuant to the PIPE Subscription Agreements (the \u201c\nPIPE Securities\n\u201d). While the PIPE Investors will agree, and will continue to be subject, to certain restrictions regarding the transfer of PIPE Securities, these shares may be sold after the expiration of the lock-up restrictions (if applicable). We will file one or more registration statements prior to or shortly after the closing of the Business Combination to provide for the resale of the PIPE Securities from time to time. We will also enter into the Amended and Restated\n \nRegistration Rights Agreement, which will require us to register under the Securities Act all the shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock held, or issuable upon exchange, by the parties to the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement. The PIPE Securities and other Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock registered pursuant to the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement (which, together, we expect to be approximately 461 million shares as of Closing) will also be available for the sale in the open market upon such registration. As restrictions on resale end and the registration statements are available for use, the market price of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock could decline if the holders of currently restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them.\nFuture issuances of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock or rights to purchase the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plan, in connection with acquisitions or otherwise, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nAfter the Closing, we would have approximately 2,461,698,750 shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock authorized but unissued, assuming that no Class A ordinary shares are redeemed from the public stockholders, or approximately 2,542,879,750 shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock authorized but unissued, assuming maximum redemptions. The Certificate of Incorporation and the applicable provisions of the DGCL authorize us to issue these shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock and options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by the PubCo Board in its sole discretion, whether in connection with acquisitions, or otherwise.\n51\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn the future, we expect to obtain financing or to further increase our capital resources by issuing additional shares of our capital stock or offering debt or other equity securities, including senior or subordinated notes, debt securities convertible into equity, or shares of preferred stock. Issuing additional shares of our capital stock, other equity securities, or securities convertible into equity may dilute the economic and voting rights of our existing stockholders, reduce the market price of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock, or both. Debt securities convertible into equity could be subject to adjustments in the conversion ratio pursuant to which certain events may increase the number of equity securities issuable upon conversion. Preferred stock, if issued, could have a preference with respect to liquidating distributions or a preference with respect to dividend payments that could limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock. Our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect the amount, timing, or nature of our future offerings. As a result, holders of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock bear the risk that our future offerings may reduce the market price of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock and dilute their percentage ownership.\nWe do not currently intend to pay cash dividends on the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock, so any returns will be substantially limited to the value of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock.\nWe have no current plans to pay any cash dividends on the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock. The declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends on shares of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock will be at the sole discretion of the PubCo Board. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends from future earnings for the foreseeable future. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is limited by the Senior Secured Credit Agreement and may be limited by covenants under other indebtedness we and our subsidiaries incur in the future, as well as other limitations and restrictions imposed by law. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock unless you sell the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock at a greater price than that which you paid for it.\nIf PubCo\u2019s voting power continues to be highly concentrated, it may prevent minority stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest.\nImmediately following the Business Combination and the application of the net proceeds from this Business Combination, the Continuing JerseyCo Owners and their affiliates will control a majority of PubCo\u2019s voting power as a result of their ownership of Domesticated Acquiror Class B Common Stock. Moreover, the Shareholders Agreement will contain provisions relating to the corporate governance of PubCo. Even when the Continuing JerseyCo Owners and their affiliates cease to own shares of PubCo\u2019s common stock representing a majority of the voting power, for so long as the Continuing JerseyCo Owners continue to own a significant percentage of its common stock, the Continuing JerseyCo Owners will still be able to significantly influence the composition of the PubCo Board and the approval of actions requiring stockholder approval through their combined voting power. Accordingly, the Continuing JerseyCo Owners and their affiliates will have significant influence with respect to our management, significant operational and strategic decisions, business plans and policies through their voting power and their rights under the Shareholders Agreement. Further, the Continuing JerseyCo Owners and their affiliates, through their combined voting power and their rights under the Shareholders Agreement, may be able to cause or prevent a change of control of our company or a change in the composition of the PubCo Board and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of our company. This concentration of voting power could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock as part of a sale of our company and ultimately may negatively affect the market price of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock.\nThe Continuing JerseyCo Owners and their affiliates engage in a broad spectrum of activities. Subject to certain restrictions on competition contained in the Shareholders Agreement, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Continuing JerseyCo Owners and their affiliates may engage in activities where their interests conflict with our interests, your interests or those of our other stockholders.\n52\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe Certificate of Incorporation and Proposed Bylaws will also provide that the Delaware Court of Chancery will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain disputes between us and our stockholders which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nThe Certificate of Incorporation will provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Delaware Court of Chancery shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for any (a) derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of PubCo, (b) action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, other employee or stockholder of PubCo to PubCo or PubCo\u2019s stockholders, or any claim for aiding and abetting such alleged breach, (c) action asserting a claim arising under any provision of the DGCL, Certificate of Incorporation or the Proposed Bylaws or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Delaware Court of Chancery, (d) action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of the Certificate of Incorporation or the Proposed Bylaws, (e) action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the law of the State of Delaware or (f) any action asserting an \u201cinternal corporate claim\u201d as defined in Section 115 of the DGCL. The Certificate of Incorporation will further provide that (i) such exclusive forum provision shall not apply to claims or causes of action brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction, and (ii) unless PubCo consents, in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the federal district courts of the United States shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a right under the Securities Act.\nSection 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the exclusive-forum provision of the Certificate of Incorporation. This exclusive-forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a court were to find the exclusive-forum provision in the Certificate of Incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors. For example, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a forum selection provision as written in connection with claims arising under the Securities Act.\nThe Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock is and will be subordinate to all of our existing and future indebtedness and any preferred stock, and effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and preferred equity claims against our subsidiaries.\nShares of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock are common equity interests in us and, as such, will rank junior to all of our existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities. Additionally, holders of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock may become subject to the prior dividend and liquidation rights of holders of any series of preferred stock that the PubCo Board may designate and issue without any action on the part of the holders of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock. Furthermore, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon any of our subsidiaries\u2019 liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary\u2019s creditors and preferred stockholders.\n53\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe initial shareholders have potential conflicts of interest in recommending that the initial shareholders vote in favor of approval of the Business Combination and the other proposals described in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus.\nIn considering the recommendation of our board of directors to vote in favor of approval of the Shareholder Proposals, our existing shareholders should keep in mind that the Sponsor and the officers and directors of APSG have financial and other interests in such proposals that are different from, or in addition to, those of our existing shareholders generally, which may result in a conflict of interest on the part of one or more of them between what they may believe is in the best interests of APSG and our existing shareholders and what they may believe is best for them. In particular:\n\u25cf\nIf APSG does not consummate a business combination within the completion window (unless such date is extended in accordance with our amended and restated articles of association and memorandum, it would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, redeeming all of the outstanding Class A ordinary shares for cash and, subject to the approval of its remaining shareholders and its board of directors, dissolving and liquidating, subject in each case to its obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. In such event, the Class B ordinary shares would be worthless because following the redemption of the Class A ordinary shares, APSG would likely have few, if any, net assets and because the holders of our Class B ordinary shares have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to the Class B ordinary shares if we fail to complete a business combination within the required period. Our sponsor paid no consideration for such Class B ordinary shares.\n\u25cf\nThe Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 12,224,134 Private Placement Warrants, each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment, at a price of $1.50 per warrant, and such Private Placement Warrants will expire and be worthless if a business combination is not consummated within the completion window) (unless such date is extended in accordance with our amended and restated articles of association and memorandum).\n\u25cf\nIn October 2008, APSG was formed by Holdings, at which point, one ordinary share was issued in exchange for the payment of operating and formation expenses of APSG. In August 2020, Holdings transferred its ownership in APSG, consisting of one ordinary share, to the Sponsor for no consideration and shortly thereafter, completed a share split of its ordinary shares and following the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, 20,345,250 Acquiror Cayman Class B shares were outstanding. As a result, the Sponsor may earn a positive rate of return on its investment even if the share price of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock falls significantly below the per share value implied in the Business Combination of $10.00 per share and our existing shareholders experience a negative rate of return and may be incentivized to complete the Business Combination, even if it is with a less favorable target company or on less favorable terms to our existing shareholders, rather than liquidate.\n\u25cf\nAPSG\u2019s independent directors each received 25,000 Class B ordinary shares prior to the Initial Public Offering at a price of $0.00087 per share. The 25,000 Class B ordinary shares currently held by each director, if unrestricted and freely tradeable, would be valued at $250,000, based on an assumed $10.00 per share value. As a result of the significantly lower investment value per share of APSG\u2019s independent directors as compared with the investment per share of our existing shareholders, a transaction which results in an increase in the value of the investment for the APSG independent directors may result in a decrease in the value of the investment of our existing shareholders. The Class B ordinary shares do not have the redemption rights of Public Shares if APSG is unable to complete its initial business combination by October 6, 2022, nor will they receive any liquidating distributions if APSG liquidates.\n\u25cf\nAPSG\u2019s existing directors and officers will be eligible for continued indemnification and continued coverage under APSG\u2019s directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance after the Business Combination.\n\u25cf\nIn order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, the Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to APSG if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to APSG, or a prospective target business with which APSG has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account or to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of APSG\u2019s Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.\n54\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u25cf\nApollo Global Securities, LLC (\u201c\nAGS\n\u201d), an affiliate of the Sponsor, has acted as an underwriter in connection with APSG\u2019s Initial Public Offering and as a private placement agent in connection with the PIPE Investment. Upon the consummation of the Business Combination, AGS will receive its portion of the $28.6 million of deferred underwriting commissions related to APSG\u2019s Initial Public Offering and its portion of the $7.5 million of placement fees related to the PIPE Investment. However, if APSG fails to consummate the Business Combination, or another business combination within the required period, such fees will not be paid to AGS.\n\u25cf\nOur sponsor has agreed to purchase 2.0 million of PIPE Securities on the same terms and conditions as the other PIPE Investors at a price of $10.00 per share.\n\u25cf\nAffiliates of the Sponsor are Tranche B-3 lenders under GBT\u2019s amended Senior Secured Credit Agreement and would indirectly benefit from the Closing of the Business Combination and the related infusion of capital.\n\u25cf\nUpon the consummation of the Business Combination, the October Note (as defined below), February Note (as defined below), June Note (as defined below) and September Note (as defined below) will be repaid by APSG to the Sponsor.  If the consummation of the Business Combination does not occur, such promissory notes will remain outstanding and could potentially go unpaid.\n\u25cf\nItai Wallach, an employee of an affiliate of the Sponsor, will serve as a director of PubCo after the Closing. As such, in the future he may receive any cash fees, stock options or stock awards that the PubCo Board determines to pay its directors.\n\u25cf\nNo compensation of any kind, including finder\u2019s and consulting fees, is paid to the Sponsor, our board of directors or APSG officers, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered prior to or in connection with the completion of an initial business combination, except for following the consummation of the Business Combination, the Sponsor, our officers and directors and their respective affiliates will be entitled to certain fees and reimbursement, as further detailed in our Proxy Statement/Prospectus, for certain reasonable out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and consummating an initial business combination, and repayment of the October Note, February Note, June Note and September Note, as discussed above. However, if APSG fails to consummate a business combination within the required period, the Sponsor and APSG\u2019s officers and directors and their respective affiliates will not have any claim against the trust account for reimbursement.\n\u25cf\nIn connection with the Business Combination Agreement, the Sponsor will receive certain registration rights with respect to its security interests in PubCo pursuant to the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement, including demand and piggy-back rights.\nThese financial and other interests of the initial shareholders may have influenced their decision to approve the Business Combination. Our existing shareholders should consider these interests when evaluating the Business Combination and the recommendation of our board of directors to vote in favor of the shareholder proposal to be considered at the Special Meeting to approve the Business Combination (the \u201c\nBusiness Combination Proposal\n\u201d) and other proposals in our Proxy Statement/Prospectus.\nThe exercise of APSG\u2019s directors\u2019 and executive officers\u2019 discretion in agreeing to changes or waivers in the terms of the Business Combination may result in a conflict of interest when determining whether changes to the terms of the Business Combination or waivers of conditions are appropriate and in the best interest of our existing shareholders.\nIn the period leading up to the closing of the Business Combination, events may occur that, pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, may require APSG to agree to amend the Business Combination Agreement, consent to certain actions taken by GBT or waive rights that APSG is entitled to under the Business Combination Agreement. Such events could arise because of changes in the course of GBT\u2019s business, a request by GBT to undertake actions that would otherwise be prohibited by the terms of the Business Combination Agreement or the occurrence of other events that would have a material adverse effect on GBT\u2019s business and would entitle APSG to terminate the Business Combination Agreement. In any of such circumstances, it would be at APSG\u2019s discretion, acting through our board of directors, to grant its consent or waive those rights. The existence of financial and personal interests of one or more of the directors described in the preceding risk factors may result in a conflict of interest on the part of such \n55\n\n\nTable of Contents\ndirector(s) between what he, she or they may believe is best for APSG and our existing shareholders and what he, she or they may believe is best for himself, herself or themselves in determining whether or not to take the requested action. As of the date of this annual report, APSG does not believe there will be any changes or waivers that APSG\u2019s directors and executive officers would be likely to make after shareholder approval of the Business Combination Proposal has been obtained. While certain changes could be made without further shareholder approval, APSG will circulate a new or amended proxy statement/prospectus and resolicit our existing shareholders if changes to the terms of the transaction that would have a material impact on our existing shareholders are required prior to the vote on the Business Combination Proposal.\nIf the sale of some or all of the PIPE Securities fails to close or sufficient holders of Class A ordinary shares exercise the APSG Share Redemption, APSG may lack sufficient funds to consummate the Business Combination or to optimize its capital structure.\nIn connection with the signing of the Business Combination Agreement, APSG entered into Subscription Agreements with the PIPE Investors which provide for the purchase of an aggregate of 33.5 million shares of PIPE Securities in a private placement to close immediately prior to or substantially concurrently with, and contingent upon, the consummation of the Business Combination, for a purchase price of $10.00 per share, or an aggregate of $335 million. The proceeds from the sale of PIPE Securities will be part of the Business Combination consideration. As of December 31, 2021, the trust account had approximately $818,368,660 million.  In addition, certain subsidiaries of GBT have obtained $200 million of delayed draw commitments under the Senior Secured New Tranche B-3.\nTerm Loan Facilities, the proceeds of which may be used for general corporate purposes, including to backstop any APSG Share Redemption (\u201c\nSpecified GBT Debt Financing\n\u201d). However, if the sale of the PIPE Securities does not close by reason of the failure by some or all of the PIPE Investors to fund the purchase price for their PIPE Securities, for example, and, despite GBT using all or a portion of the delayed draw commitments under the Senior Secured New Tranche B-3 Term Loan Facilities to backstop any APSG Share Redemption, and a sufficient number of holders of Class A ordinary shares exercise APSG Share Redemption, APSG may lack sufficient funds to consummate the Business Combination. Additionally, the PIPE Investors\u2019 obligations to purchase the PIPE Securities are subject to termination prior to the closing of the PIPE Investment (a) if the Business Combination Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms; (b) by mutual written agreement of the parties to such PIPE Subscription Agreement and GBT, or (c) if the transactions contemplated by the Subscription Agreement have not been consummated within 10 months after the date of the PIPE Subscription Agreements, other than as a result of breach by the terminating party. The PIPE Investors\u2019 obligations to purchase the PIPE Securities are subject to fulfillment of customary closing conditions, including that the Business Combination must be consummated substantially concurrently with the purchase of PIPE Securities. In the event of any such failure to fund, any obligation is so terminated or any such condition is not satisfied and not waived, APSG may not be able to obtain additional funds to account for such shortfall on terms favorable to GBT or at all. Any such shortfall would also reduce the amount of funds that we have available for working capital of PubCo. Furthermore, raising such additional financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. While the PIPE Investors represented to APSG that they have sufficient funds to satisfy their obligations under the respective PIPE Subscription Agreements, APSG has not obligated them to reserve funds for such obligations. Pursuant to the Business Combination, GBT\u2019s obligation to consummate the Business Combination is conditioned upon APSG satisfying the Minimum Available Acquiror Cash Condition.\nBecause GBT is not conducting an underwritten offering of its securities, no underwriter has conducted a due diligence review of GBT\u2019s business, operations or financial condition or reviewed the disclosure in our Proxy Statement/Prospectus.\nSection 11 of the Securities Act (\u201c\nSection 11\n\u201d) imposes liability on parties, including underwriters, involved in a securities offering if the registration statement contains a materially false statement or material omission. To effectively establish a due diligence defense against a cause of action brought pursuant to Section 11, a defendant, including an underwriter, carries the burden of proof to demonstrate that such party, after reasonable investigation, believed that the statements in the registration statement were free from material misstatements and omissions. In order to meet this burden of proof, underwriters in a registered offering typically conduct extensive due diligence of the registrant and vet the registrant\u2019s disclosures in the registration statement. Such due diligence may include calls with the issuer\u2019s management, review of material agreements, and background checks on key personnel, among other investigations.\nBecause GBT intends to become publicly traded through the Business Combination rather than through an underwritten offering of GBT common stock, no underwriter is involved in the transaction. As a result, no underwriter has conducted diligence on \n56\n\n\nTable of Contents\nGBT or APSG in order to establish a due diligence defense with respect to the disclosures presented in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. While sponsors, private investors and management in a business combination undertake financial, legal and other due diligence, it is not necessarily the same review or analysis that would be undertaken by an underwriter in an underwritten public offering. If such review and analysis had occurred, it is possible that certain information in our Proxy Statement/Prospectus may have been presented in a different manner or additional information may have been presented at the request of such underwriter.\nSubsequent to the consummation of the Business Combination, PubCo may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on its financial condition and its share price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nAPSG cannot assure you that the due diligence APSG has conducted on GBT will reveal all material issues that may be present with regard to GBT, or that factors outside of APSG\u2019s or GBT\u2019s control will not later arise, and the Business Combination Agreement does not generally provide for indemnification of PubCo in respect of historical liability or with respect to GBT\u2019s business. As a result of unidentified issues or factors outside of APSG\u2019s or GBT\u2019s control, PubCo may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in reporting losses. Even if APSG\u2019s due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with the preliminary risk analysis conducted by APSG. Even though these charges may be non-cash items that would not have an immediate impact on PubCo\u2019s liquidity, the fact that PubCo reports charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about PubCo or its securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause PubCo to violate leverage or other covenants to which it may be subject. Accordingly, any of our existing shareholders who chooses to remain a shareholder following the Business Combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares from any such write-down or write-downs.\nIf the Business Combination is consummated, our existing shareholders will experience dilution.\nFollowing consummation of the Business Combination, the holders of Class A ordinary shares will own approximately 15% of the fully diluted common equity of PubCo (assuming that Class A ordinary shares are elected to be redeemed by the holders thereof). If any of the Class A ordinary shares are redeemed in connection with the Business Combination, the percentage of PubCo\u2019s fully diluted common equity held by the former holders of Class A ordinary shares will decrease relative to the percentage held if none of the Class A ordinary shares are redeemed. To the extent that, prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, GBT elects to settle the GBT Preferred Shares in equity (as opposed to cash) or GBT MIP Shares vest and become exercisable for Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock at the Closing, our existing shareholders may experience substantial dilution. Additionally, to the extent that, following the consummation of the Business Combination, any of the outstanding warrants or options are exercised for shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock or any Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock is issued to holders of earnout shares, our existing shareholders may experience substantial dilution.\nNeither the Business Combination Agreement nor our amended and restated articles of association and memorandum include a specified maximum redemption threshold. The absence of such a redemption threshold may make it possible to complete a Business Combination in which a substantial majority of Public Shareholders do not agree.\nNeither our amended and restated articles of association and memorandum nor the Business Combination Agreement provide a specified maximum redemption threshold, except that, under both, in no event will APSG redeem Class A ordinary shares in an amount that would cause APSG\u2019s net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (such that APSG is not subject to the SEC\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules). In addition, the Business Combination Agreement does not provide a maximum redemption threshold; instead the Business Combination Agreement provides that, if the sum of (i) the amount of cash available in the trust account following the Special Meeting, after deducting the amount required to satisfy the APSG Share Redemption, plus (ii) the amount of APSG\u2019s cash on hand (outside of the trust account) immediately prior to the Closing, plus (iii) the PIPE Investment Amount (the \u201c\nAvailable Acquiror Cash\n\u201d) does not meet the Minimum Available Acquiror Cash Condition, GBT will not be obligated to consummate the Business Combination. However, GBT may waive this condition with the consent of APSG. As a result of these conditions, APSG will be able to complete the Business Combination even if a substantial majority of the holders of Class A ordinary shares have redeemed their shares.\n57\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIf the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary, to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies if, based upon the proxies held at the time of the Special Meeting is not approved, and an insufficient number of votes have been obtained to authorize the consummation of the Business Combination and the Domestication, the APSG Board will not have the ability to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date in order to solicit further votes, and, therefore, the Business Combination will not be approved, and, therefore, the Business Combination may not be consummated.\nOur board of directors is seeking approval to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if, at the Special Meeting, based upon the proxies held, our board of directors considers that there are insufficient votes to approve each of the Condition Precedent Proposals. If the Adjournment Proposal is not approved, then APSG will not have the ability to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date and, therefore, will not have more time to solicit votes to approve the Condition Precedent Proposals. In such event, the Business Combination would not be completed.\nDuring the pendency of the Business Combination, APSG will not be able to solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry, indication of interest or request for information with respect to, or the making of, any proposal or offer from any third party because of restrictions in the Business Combination Agreement. Furthermore, certain provisions of the Business Combination Agreement will discourage third parties from submitting alternative takeover proposals, including proposals that may be superior to the arrangements contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement.\nDuring the pendency of the Business Combination, APSG will not be able to enter into a business combination with another party because of restrictions in the Business Combination Agreement. Furthermore, certain provisions of the Business Combination Agreement will discourage third parties from submitting alternative takeover proposals, including proposals that may be superior to the arrangements contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, in part because of the inability of our board of directors to change its recommendation in connection with the Business Combination.\nCertain covenants in the Business Combination Agreement impede the ability of APSG to make acquisitions or complete certain other transactions pending consummation of the Business Combination. As a result, APSG may be at a disadvantage to its competitors during that period. In addition, if the Business Combination is not completed, these provisions will make it more difficult to complete an alternative business combination following the termination of the Business Combination Agreement due to the passage of time during which these provisions have remained in effect.\nBecause APSG is incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, in the event the Business Combination is not completed, you may face difficulties in protecting your interests, and your ability to protect your rights through the U.S. Federal courts may be limited.\nAPSG is currently an exempted limited company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon APSG\u2019s directors or officers, or enforce judgments obtained in the United States courts against APSG\u2019s directors or officers.\nUntil Domestication is effected, APSG\u2019s corporate affairs will be governed by our amended and restated articles of association and memorandum, the Cayman Islands Companies Act (as the same may be supplemented or amended from time to time) and the common law of the Cayman Islands. APSG is also subject to the federal securities laws of the United States. The rights of shareholders to take action against the directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of APSG\u2019s directors to APSG under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by statutory law and the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law, the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority, but are not binding on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our existing shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of APSG\u2019s directors under Cayman Islands law are different from what they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United States, including the DGCL. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a different body of securities laws as compared to the United States, and certain states, such as Delaware, may have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action in a Federal court of the United States.\n58\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe courts of the Cayman Islands are unlikely (i) to recognize or enforce against APSG judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state; and (ii) in original actions brought in the Cayman Islands, to impose liabilities against APSG predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state, so far as the liabilities imposed by those provisions are penal in nature. In those circumstances, although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce a foreign money judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle that a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes upon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided certain conditions are met. For a foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated sum, and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a Cayman Islands judgment in respect of the same matter, impeachable on the grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, or be of a kind the enforcement of which is, contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to public policy). A Cayman Islands court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere.\nAs a result of all of the above, holders of the Class A ordinary shares may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by management, members of our board of directors or controlling shareholders than they would as public shareholders of a United States company.\nThe Domestication may result in adverse tax consequences for holders of Acquiror Cayman Shares or Warrants, including our existing shareholders.\nU.S. holders (as defined in our Proxy Statement/Prospectus) may be subject to U.S. federal income tax as a result of the Domestication. It is intended that the Domestication qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201c\nCode\n\u201d), for U.S. federal income tax purposes. \nHowever, due to the absence of direct guidance on the application of Section 368(a)(1)(F) to a statutory conversion of a corporation holding only investment-type assets such as APSG, this result is not entirely clear.\nAssuming the Domestication qualifies as a reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Code, U.S. holders of Acquiror Cayman Shares will be subject to Section 367(b) of the Code, and as a result:\n\u25cf\na U.S. holder of Acquiror Cayman Shares whose Acquiror Cayman Shares have a fair market value of less than $50,000 on the date of the Domestication should not recognize any gain or loss and generally should not be required to include any part of APSG\u2019s earnings in income pursuant to the Domestication;\n\u25cf\na U.S. holder of Acquiror Cayman Shares whose Acquiror Cayman Shares have a fair market value of $50,000 or more on the date of the Domestication, but who on the date of the Domestication owns (actually and constructively) less than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of Acquiror Cayman Shares entitled to vote and less than 10% of the total value of all classes of Acquiror Cayman Shares will generally recognize gain (but not loss) with respect to the Domestication, as if such U.S. holder exchanged its Acquiror Cayman Shares for Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock in a taxable transaction. As an alternative to recognizing gain, such U.S. holders may file an election to include in income as a dividend the \u201call earnings and profits amount\u201d (as defined in Treasury Regulation) Section 1.367(b)-2(d)) attributable to their Acquiror Cayman Shares, provided certain other requirements are satisfied. APSG does not expect that cumulative earnings and profits will be material at the time of Domestication; and\n\u25cf\na U.S. holder of Acquiror Cayman Shares who on the date of the Domestication owns (actually and constructively) 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of Acquiror Cayman Shares entitled to vote or 10% or more of the total value of all classes of Acquiror Cayman Shares will generally be required to include in income as a dividend the \u201call earnings and profits amount\u201d (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(b)-2(d)) attributable to its Acquiror Cayman Shares. Any such U.S. holder that is a corporation may, under certain circumstances, effectively be exempt from taxation on a portion or all of the deemed dividend pursuant to Section 245A of the Code. APSG does not expect that cumulative earnings and profits will be material at the time of the Domestication.\n59\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFurthermore, if the Domestication qualifies as a reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Code, a U.S. holder of Acquiror Cayman Shares or Acquiror Cayman Warrants may, in certain circumstances, still recognize gain (but not loss) upon the exchange of Acquiror Cayman Shares or Acquiror Cayman Warrants for Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock, Domesticated Acquiror Class B Common Stock or Domesticated Acquiror Warrants under the PFIC (as defined below) rules of the Code. Proposed Treasury Regulations with a retroactive effective date have been promulgated under Section 1291(f) of the Code which generally require that a U.S. person who disposes of stock of a PFIC (including for this purpose exchanging Acquiror Cayman Warrants for Domesticated Acquiror Warrants) must recognize gain equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock, Domesticated Acquiror Class B Common Stock or Domesticated Acquiror Warrants received in the Domestication and the U.S. holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the corresponding Acquiror Cayman Shares or Acquiror Cayman Warrants surrendered in exchange therefor, notwithstanding any other provision of the Code. Because APSG is a blank check company with no current active business, we believe that it is likely that APSG is classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, these proposed Treasury Regulations, if finalized in their current form, would generally require a U.S. holder of Acquiror Cayman Shares to recognize gain on the exchange of such shares for shares of PubCo pursuant to the Domestication, unless such U.S. holder has made certain tax elections with respect to such U.S. holder\u2019s Acquiror Cayman Shares. Proposed Treasury Regulations, if finalized in their current form would also apply to a U.S. holder who exchanges Acquiror Cayman Warrants for newly issued Domesticated Acquiror Warrants; currently, however, a U.S. holder cannot make the aforementioned elections with respect to such U.S. holder\u2019s Acquiror Cayman Warrants. Any such gain would be taxed as ordinary income and an interest charge would apply based on complex rules designed to offset the tax deferral to such U.S. holder on the undistributed earnings, if any, of APSG. It is not possible to determine at this time whether, in what form, and with what effective date, final Treasury Regulations under Section 1291(f) of the Code will be adopted.\nAdditionally, the Domestication may cause non-U.S. holders (as defined in our Proxy Statement/Prospectus) to become subject to U.S. federal withholding taxes on any dividends paid in respect of such non-U.S. holder\u2019s Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock or Domesticated Acquiror Class B Common Stock after the Domestication.\nFurthermore, because the Domestication will occur immediately prior to the APSG Share Redemption, U.S. holders exercising such redemption rights will be subject to the potential tax consequences of the Domestication.\nThe tax consequences of the Domestication are complex and will depend on a holder\u2019s particular circumstances. All holders are strongly urged to consult their tax advisors for a full description and understanding of the tax consequences of the Domestication, including the applicability and effect of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income and other tax laws.\nPubCo\u2019s business and operations could be negatively affected if it becomes subject to any securities litigation or shareholder activism, which could cause PubCo to incur significant expense, hinder execution of business and growth strategy and impact its stock price.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Shareholder activism, which could take many forms or arise in a variety of situations, has been increasing recently. Volatility in the stock price of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock or other reasons may in the future cause it to become the target of securities litigation or shareholder activism. Securities litigation and shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s and the PubCo Boards\u2019 attention and resources from PubCo\u2019s business. Additionally, such securities litigation and shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to PubCo\u2019s future, adversely affect its relationships with service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, PubCo may be required to incur significant legal fees and other expenses related to any securities litigation and activist shareholder matters. Further, its stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any securities litigation and shareholder activism.\n60\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThere is no guarantee that a shareholder\u2019s decision whether to redeem its shares for a pro rata portion of the trust account will put the shareholder in a better future economic position.\nAPSG can give no assurance as to the price at which a shareholder may be able to sell its Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock in the future following the consummation of the Business Combination or any alternative business combination. Certain events following the consummation of any business combination, including the Business Combination, may cause an increase in share price, and may result in a lower value realized now than a shareholder of PubCo might realize in the future had the shareholder not redeemed its shares. Similarly, if a shareholder does not redeem its shares, the shareholder will bear the risk of ownership of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock after the consummation of the Business Combination, and there can be no assurance that a shareholder can sell its shares in the future for a greater amount than the redemption price set forth in our Proxy Statement/Prospectus. A shareholder should consult the shareholder\u2019s own financial advisor for assistance on how this may affect his, her or its individual situation.\nThe holders of our warrants may only be able to exercise warrants on a \u201ccashless basis\u201d under certain circumstances, and if they do so, they will receive fewer Class A ordinary shares or Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock, as applicable, from such exercise than if they were to exercise such warrants for cash.\nThe Warrant Agreement, dated as of October 1, 2020, by and between APSG and Continental Stock & Trust Company (the \u201c\nWarrant Agreement\n\u201d), provides that in the following circumstances holders of warrants who seek to exercise their warrants will not be permitted to do for cash and will, instead, be required to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act: (i) if the Class A ordinary shares or Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock, as applicable, issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities Act in accordance with the terms of the Warrant Agreement and (ii) if APSG or PubCo has so elected and the Class A ordinary shares or Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock, as applicable, are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of \u201ccovered securities\u201d under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act. If, in connection with the Business Combination, you exercise your Acquiror Cayman Warrants on a cashless basis, you would pay the warrant exercise price by surrendering all of the warrants for that number of Class A ordinary shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of Class A ordinary shares underlying the Acquiror Cayman Warrants, multiplied by the excess of the \u201cfair market value\u201d of Class A ordinary shares (as defined in the next sentence) over the exercise price of the Acquiror Cayman Warrants by (y) the fair market value. The \u201cfair market value\u201d is the average reported last sale price of the Class A ordinary shares for the 10 trading days ending on the third (3rd) trading day prior to the date on which the notice of exercise is received by the warrant agent or on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants, as applicable. As a result, you would receive fewer shares of Class A ordinary shares from such exercise than if you were to exercise the Acquiror Cayman Warrants for cash. This will result in the holders of Acquiror Cayman Warrants having a reduced potential \u201cupside\u201d of their investment in APSG.\nThe grant of registration rights to the Sponsor and the Continuing JerseyCo Owners and the future exercise of such rights may adversely affect the market price of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock.\nUpon the Closing, the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement will be entered into between PubCo, the Sponsor, the Insiders and the Continuing JerseyCo Owners, replacing APSG\u2019s existing registration rights agreement. The Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement in substantially the form it will be executed in connection with the Closing is attached to our Proxy Statement/Prospectus as Annex J. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement, the Continuing JerseyCo Owners and the Sponsor, and, in each case, their permitted transferees will have customary registration rights (including demand and piggy-back rights, subject to cooperation and cut-back provisions) with respect to (i) the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock (including Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock issuable upon the exchange or conversion of the Class B ordinary shares and the Domesticated Acquiror Class X Common Stock), (ii) any shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock that may be acquired by the Sponsor, the Insiders or Continuing JerseyCo Owners upon the exercise of a warrant or other right to acquire Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock held by the Sponsor, the Insiders or Continuing JerseyCo Owners immediately following the consummation of the Business Combination or to the extent such securities are \u201crestricted securities\u201d (as defined in Rule 144) or are otherwise held by an \u201caffiliate\u201d (as defined in Rule 144) of the Company, and (iii) any other equity security of PubCo or any of its subsidiaries issued or issuable with respect to any securities referenced in clauses (i) and (ii) above by way of way of a stock dividend or stock split or in connection with a recapitalization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, reorganization or similar transaction.\n61\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFurther, pursuant to the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement, we agreed that we will submit or file within (i) 30 calendar days after the consummation of the Business Combination or (ii) 90 calendar days following PubCo\u2019s most recent fiscal year end if audited financials for the year ended December 31, 2021 are required to be included, a registration statement with the SEC covering the resale of certain shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock and other securities held by the Sponsor or Continuing JerseyCo Owners, and that we will use commercially reasonable efforts to have such registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof, but no later than the earlier of (i) 60 calendar days (or 90 calendar days if the SEC notifies us that it will \u201creview\u201d the registration statement) after the filing thereof and (ii) the tenth business day after the date we are notified (orally or in writing, whichever is earlier) by the SEC that the registration statement will not be reviewed or will not be subject to further review. As of the Closing, we expect holders of approximately 429 million shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock (or securities convertible into Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock) to have registration rights under the Registration Rights Agreement. As discussed previously, the 33.5 million PIPE Securities will also have registration rights. The registration and availability of such a significant number of securities for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock.\nThe provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that relate to the rights of holders of Class A ordinary shares (and corresponding provisions of the agreement governing the release of funds from the trust account) may be amended with the approval of at least 66\u2154% of our existing shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of APSG, which is a lower amendment threshold than that of some other blank check companies. It may be easier for APSG, therefore, to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to facilitate the consummation of the Business Combination that some of the APSG holders of Class A ordinary shares may not support.\nSome other blank check companies have a provision in their charter which prohibits the amendment of certain of its provisions, including those which relate to the rights of a company\u2019s shareholders, without approval by a certain percentage of the company\u2019s shareholders. In those companies, amendment of these provisions typically requires approval by between 90% and 100% of the company\u2019s shareholders. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that most of its provisions related to the rights of holders of the Class A ordinary shares (including the requirement to deposit proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement Warrants into the trust account and not release such amounts except in specified circumstances, and to provide Redemption Rights to holders of Class A ordinary shares as described herein) may be amended if approved by special resolution. This means that the holders of at least 66\u2154% of the Acquiror Cayman Shares who attend and vote at a general meeting of APSG may amend the corresponding provisions of the trust agreement governing the release of funds from the trust account may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of Acquiror Cayman Shares; provided that the provisions of the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association governing either (i) the appointment or removal of directors prior to an initial business combination or (ii) the Domestication, may only be amended by a special resolution passed by not less than 90% of the Acquiror Cayman Shares who attend and vote at a general meeting. Our initial shareholders, who collectively beneficially own approximately 20% of the Acquiror Cayman Shares as of the date of this annual report, may participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and/or trust agreement and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. As a result, APSG may be able to amend the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association which govern its pre-Business Combination behavior more easily than some other special purpose acquisition companies, and this may increase APSG\u2019s ability to complete the Business Combination with which you may not agree. Our existing shareholders may pursue remedies against APSG for any breach of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association.\nThe Sponsor and APSG\u2019s executive officers and directors agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with APSG, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to modify the substance or timing of APSG\u2019s obligation to provide for the share redemption or to redeem 100% of the Class A ordinary shares if APSG does not complete the Business Combination within the completion window or with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of the Class A ordinary shares, unless APSG provides the holders of Class A ordinary shares with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to APSG to pay its income taxes, if any, divided by the number of then outstanding Class A ordinary shares. The shareholders are not parties to, or third party beneficiaries of, these agreements and, as a result, will not have the ability to pursue remedies against the Sponsor, executive officers or directors for any breach of these agreements. As a result, in the event of a breach, the holders of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock and Domesticated Acquiror Class B Common Stock would need to pursue a shareholder derivative action, subject to applicable law.\n62\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAPSG or PubCo, as applicable, may redeem unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to holders of such warrants, thereby making such warrants worthless. Additionally, the exercise price for the warrants is $11.50 per share and the warrants may expire worthless unless the Class A ordinary share price or Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock price, as applicable, is higher than the exercise price during the exercise period.\nAPSG prior to the consummation of the Business Combination and PubCo following the consummation of the Business Combination will have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per warrant, provided that the last sale price of the Class A ordinary shares or Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock, as applicable, equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) on each of 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which notice of such redemption is given. APSG or PubCo, as applicable, will not redeem the warrants unless an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the Class A ordinary shares or Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock, as applicable, issuable upon exercise of the warrants is effective and a current proxy statement/prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares or Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock, as applicable, is available throughout the 30-day redemption period, except if the warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis and such cashless exercise is exempt from registration under the Securities Act. Historical trading prices for the Class A ordinary share price have not exceeded $11.00 and as such, the warrants have not become redeemable by APSG. If and when the warrants become redeemable by APSG or PubCo, as applicable, APSG or PubCo may exercise its redemption right even if it is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. In the event that APSG or PubCo, as applicable, determined to redeem the warrants, APSG or PubCo will fix a date for the redemption. Notice of redemption will be mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, by the APSG or PubCo, as applicable, not less than 30 days prior to such date to the holders of the warrants to be redeemed at their last addresses as they appear on the registration books. Any notice of redemption mailed in the manner as provided will be conclusively presumed to have been duly given whether or not the holder received such notice. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force holders thereof to (i) exercise warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for such holder to do so, (ii) sell warrants at the then-current market price when such holder might otherwise wish to hold warrants or (iii) accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of such warrants. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the warrants, except that (i) they will not be redeemable by APSG or PubCo so long as they are held by our sponsor or its permitted transferees; (ii) they will not be, subject to certain limited exceptions, transferable, assignable, or salable until 30 days after the completion of APSG\u2019s initial business combination, (iii) our sponsor or its permitted transferees have the option to exercise such warrants on a cashless basis and (iv) they are entitled to registration rights. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by holders other than the sponsor or its permitted transferees, they will be redeemable by APSG or PubCo. If the Private Placement Warrants are exercised on a \u201ccashless basis,\u201d APSG or PubCo, as applicable will not receive any cash proceeds from the exercise of such warrants.\nIn addition, PubCo may redeem warrants after they become exercisable for a number of shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock determined based on the redemption date and the fair market value of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock. Any such redemption may have similar consequences to a cash redemption described above. In addition, such redemption may occur at a time when the warrants are \u201cout-of-the-money,\u201d in which case holders thereof would lose any potential embedded value from a subsequent increase in the value of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock had such warrants remained outstanding.\nOur existing shareholders who redeem their Class\u00a0A ordinary shares may continue to hold any warrants that they own, which results in additional dilution to non-redeeming shareholders upon exercise of such warrants or Domesticated Acquiror Warrants, as applicable.\nOur existing shareholders who redeem their Class\u00a0A ordinary shares may continue to hold any warrants that they owned prior to redemption, which results in additional dilution to non-redeeming holders upon exercise of such warrants. Assuming (a)\u00a0all redeeming APSG shareholders acquired\u00a0units in the Initial Public Offering and continue to hold the warrants that were included in the\u00a0units, and (b)\u00a0maximum redemption of Class\u00a0A ordinary shares held by the redeeming APSG shareholders, 27,227,000 Acquiror Cayman Warrants would be retained by redeeming APSG Shareholders. As a result, the non-redeeming APSG shareholders would suffer additional dilution in their\u00a0percentage ownership and voting interest of the post-combination company upon exercise of the warrants or Domesticated Acquiror Warrants held by redeeming APSG shareholders.\n63\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe Acquiror Cayman Warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock.\nWe issued the Acquiror Cayman Warrants to purchase 27,227,000 of Class A ordinary shares as part of the Acquiror Cayman Units and, simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we issued in a private placement an aggregate of 11,333,334 Private Placement Warrants, each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at $11.50 per share. Subsequently, we issued and sold an additional 6,681,000 Over-Allotment Units pursuant to the underwriters\u2019 Over-Allotment Option at a price of $10.00 per unit and sold an additional 890,800 Private Placement Warrants. Subject to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, upon the Domestication, the Domesticated Acquiror Warrants will entitle the holders thereof to purchase shares of Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock, and, upon consummation of the Business Combination, all Class B ordinary shares will convert to Domesticated Acquiror Class A Common Stock.\nRisks Relating to Conflicts and Our Management Team\nCertain members of our management and board are required to present opportunities to Apollo prior to us, and this may impede our ability to acquire a target business that would be attractive to us.\nCertain members of our management team and directors, including those who are affiliated with Apollo, have fiduciary duties or are subject to contractual obligations or policies and procedures that require them to present business opportunities that may be appropriate for one or more entities, including Apollo Funds, to the respective investment committees of such entities or funds prior to presenting such opportunities to us regardless of the capacity in which they are made aware of such opportunities. This may impede our ability to acquire a target business that would be attractive to us. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for both us and another entity, including any Apollo entity, about which any member of our management team or director acquires knowledge and we will waive any claim or cause of action we may have in respect thereof. We cannot guarantee that any opportunity that would be suitable for us will not be pursued by another entity, including Apollo or an Apollo Fund, or that any opportunity that is passed upon by such other entity will be referred to us in a timely manner or at all.\nApollo may choose not to refer certain opportunities to us due to reputational interests, financial interests, confidentiality concerns, legal, regulatory, tax and any other interests or considerations relevant to Apollo, its clients and their respective portfolio companies.\nApollo, together with its clients, engages in a broad range of business activities and invests in a broad range of businesses and assets. Apollo takes into account interests of its affiliates, clients and each of their respective portfolio companies (including reputational interests, financial interests, confidentiality concerns, legal, regulatory, tax and any other interests or considerations that arise from time to time) when determining whether to pursue (or how to structure) a potential transaction or investment opportunity. As a result, it is possible that Apollo may choose not to refer a business opportunity to us or that members of our management or directors who are affiliated with Apollo may choose not to pursue an opportunity notwithstanding that such opportunity would be attractive to us due to the reputational, financial, confidentiality, legal, regulatory, tax and/or other interests or considerations of Apollo and its affiliates.\nWe are dependent upon our officers and directors, and their loss could adversely affect our ability to operate.\nOur operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of individuals and, in particular, our officers and directors. We believe that our success depends on the continued service of our officers and directors, at least until we have completed our initial business combination. In addition, our officers and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating their time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. We do not have an employment agreement with, or key-man insurance on the life of, any of our directors or officers. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our directors or officers or their removal could have a detrimental effect on us.\n64\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur ability to successfully effect our initial business combination and to be successful thereafter will be totally dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel, some of whom may join us following our initial business combination. The loss of key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business.\nOur ability to successfully effect our business combination is dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel. The role of our key personnel in the target business, however, cannot presently be ascertained. Although some of our key personnel may remain with the target business in senior management or advisory positions following our business combination, it is likely that some or all of the management of the target business will remain in place. While we intend to closely scrutinize any individuals we engage after our initial business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct. These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a company regulated by the SEC, which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements.\nIn addition, the officers and directors of an acquisition candidate may resign upon completion of our initial business combination. The departure of a business combination target\u2019s key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business. The role of an acquisition candidate\u2019s key personnel upon the completion of our initial business combination cannot be ascertained at this time. Although we contemplate that certain members of an acquisition candidate\u2019s management team will remain associated with the acquisition candidate following our initial business combination, it is possible that members of the management of an acquisition candidate will not wish to remain in place. The loss of key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business.\nOur key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements with a target business in connection with a particular business combination, and a particular business combination may be conditioned on the retention or resignation of such key personnel. These agreements may provide for them to receive compensation following our business combination and as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business combination is the most advantageous.\nOur key personnel may be able to remain with our company after the completion of our business combination only if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for such individuals to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to us after the completion of the business combination. Such negotiations also could make such key personnel\u2019s retention or resignation a condition to any such agreement. The personal and financial interests of such individuals may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business.\nOur officers and directors will allocate their time to other businesses thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs. These conflicts of interest could have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination.\nOur officers and directors are not required to, and will not, commit their full time to our affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and our search for a business combination and their other businesses. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Each of our officers is engaged in several other business endeavors for which he may be entitled to substantial compensation, and our officers are not obligated to contribute any specific number of hours per week to our affairs. In particular, all of our officers and certain of our directors are also employed by Apollo, which is an investment manager to various private investment funds, partnerships and accounts which may make investments in companies that we may target for our initial business combination. \nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer also serve in those roles for Apollo Strategic Growth Capital II (\u201c\nAPSG II\n\u201d), a special purpose acquisition company sponsored by an affiliate of Apollo that completed its initial public offering in February\u00a02021 and Apollo Strategic Growth Capital III (\u201c\nAPSG\u00a0III\n\u201d), a special purpose acquisition company sponsored by an affiliate of Apollo that publicly filed a registration statement on Form\u00a0S-1 in March\u00a02021. Neither APSG II or APSG III have announced a business combination. Our Executive Chairman is also the Executive Chairman for APSG II. \nOur independent directors may also serve as officers or board members for other entities. If our officers\u2019 and directors\u2019 other business affairs require them to devote substantial amounts of time to such affairs in excess of their current commitment levels, it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs which may have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination.\n65\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCertain of our officers and directors are now, and all of them may in the future become, affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time and determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. In addition, we may be precluded from opportunities because they are being pursued by Apollo or Apollo Funds and they may outperform any business we acquire.\nUntil we consummate our initial business combination, we intend to engage in the business of identifying and combining with one or more businesses. Our sponsor and officers and directors are, and may in the future become, affiliated with entities that are engaged in a similar business.\nOur officers and directors also may become aware of business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us and the other entities to which they owe certain fiduciary or contractual duties. Accordingly, they will have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and a potential target business may be presented to another entity prior to its presentation to us. To the extent a potential business opportunity may be appropriate for one or more Apollo Funds, such business opportunity will be presented to such other entities prior to presentation to us. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for both us and another entity, including any Apollo entity, about which any member of our management team or director acquires knowledge and we will waive any claim or cause of action we may have in respect thereof.\nIn addition, Apollo manages a significant number of Apollo Funds which may compete with us for acquisition opportunities and if pursued by them we may be precluded from such opportunities. Investment ideas generated within Apollo and investment opportunities of which Apollo becomes aware may be suitable for both us and for Apollo and/or current or future Apollo Funds.\nSuch investment ideas and opportunities will be presented by Apollo to such Apollo Funds prior to presentation to us; as a result, we may be precluded from such opportunities. Such opportunities may outperform any businesses we acquire. Neither Apollo nor members of our management team who are also employed by Apollo have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware.\nOur officers, directors, security holders and their respective affiliates may have competitive pecuniary interests that conflict with our interests.\nWe have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, officers, security holders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect pecuniary or financial interest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest. In fact, we may enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our sponsor, our directors or officers, although we do not intend to do so, or we may acquire a target business through an Affiliated Joint Acquisition with one or more affiliates of Apollo, one or more Apollo Funds and/or one or more investors in the Apollo Funds. We do not have a policy that expressly prohibits any such persons from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. Accordingly, such persons or entities may have a conflict between their interests and ours.\nIn addition, Apollo and its affiliates and certain of the Apollo Funds engage in the business of originating, underwriting, syndicating, acquiring and trading loans and debt securities of corporate and other borrowers, and may provide or participate in any debt financing arrangement in connection with any acquisition, financing or disposition of any target business that we may make. If Apollo or any of its affiliates or the Apollo Funds provides or participates in any such debt financing arrangement it may present a conflict of interest and will have to be approved under our related person transaction policy or by our independent directors.\n66\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe may not have sufficient funds to satisfy indemnification claims of our directors and officers.\nWe have agreed to indemnify our officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law. However, our officers and directors have agreed, and any persons who may become officers or directors prior to the initial business combination will agree, to waive any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the trust account and to not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason whatsoever. Accordingly, any indemnification provided will be able to be satisfied by us only if (i)\u00a0we have sufficient funds outside of the trust account or (ii)\u00a0we consummate an initial business combination. Our obligation to indemnify our officers and directors may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against our officers or directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against our officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our shareholders. Furthermore, a shareholder\u2019s investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against our officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions.\nWe may engage in a business combination with one or more target businesses that have relationships with entities that may be affiliated with our sponsor, officers, directors or existing holders which may raise potential conflicts of interest.\nIn light of the involvement of our sponsor, officers and directors with other entities, we may decide to acquire one or more businesses affiliated with our sponsor, officers, directors or existing holders. Our officers and directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities, including, without limitation, those described under \u201cItem\u00a010. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\n\u2014\nConflicts of Interest.\u201d They may also have investments in target businesses. Such entities may compete with us for business combination opportunities. Our sponsor, officers and directors are not currently aware of any specific opportunities for us to complete our business combination with any entities with which they are affiliated, and there have been no preliminary discussions concerning a business combination with any such entity or entities. Although we will not be specifically focusing on, or targeting, any transaction with any affiliated entities, we would pursue such a transaction if we determined that such affiliated entity met our criteria for a business combination as set forth in \u201cItem\u00a01.\u2009 Business\u2014Initial Business Combination\u201d and such transaction was approved by a majority of our independent and disinterested directors. Despite our obligation to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or from an independent accounting firm regarding the fairness to our company from a financial point of view of a business combination with one or more domestic or international businesses affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, potential conflicts of interest still may exist and, as a result, the terms of the business combination may not be as advantageous to our public shareholders as they would be absent any conflicts of interest.\nMoreover, we may pursue an Affiliated Joint Acquisition opportunity with one or more affiliates of Apollo, one or more Apollo Funds and/or one or more investors in the Apollo Funds. Any such parties may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the business combination by issuing to such parties a class of equity or equity-linked securities. Accordingly, such persons or entities may have a conflict between their interests and ours.\nSince our sponsor, officers and directors will lose their entire investment in us if our business combination is not completed (other than with respect to public shares they may acquire during or after the Initial Public Offering), a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for our initial business combination.\nAs of March 1, 2022, our initial shareholders owned an aggregate of 20,420,250 Class\u00a0B ordinary shares. The Class\u00a0B ordinary shares will be worthless if we do not complete our initial business combination. In addition, our sponsor purchased 12,224,134 Private Placement Warrants, each exercisable for one Class\u00a0A ordinary share at $11.50 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $18,336,201, or $1.50 per warrant, that will also be worthless if we do not complete a business combination. The Class\u00a0B ordinary shares are identical to the Class\u00a0A ordinary shares included in the Units, except that they automatically convert into our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares at the time of completion of our initial business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment pursuant to certain anti-dilution rights, as described herein. However, the holders have agreed (A)\u00a0to vote any shares owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination and (B)\u00a0not to redeem any Class\u00a0B ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination. In addition, we may obtain loans from our sponsor, affiliates of our sponsor or an officer or director. The personal and financial interests of our officers and directors may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business combination, completing an initial business combination and influencing the operation of the business following our initial business combination. This risk may become more acute as the end of the completion window nears.\n67\n\n\nTable of Contents\nChanges in the market for directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate and complete an initial business combination.\nIn recent months, the market for directors and officers liability insurance for special purpose acquisition companies has changed in ways adverse to us and our management team. Fewer insurance companies are offering quotes for directors and officers liability coverage, the premiums charged for such policies have generally increased and the terms of such policies have generally become less favorable. These trends may continue into the future.\nAPSG\u2019s existing directors and officers will be eligible for continued indemnification and continued coverage under APSG\u2019s existing directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance after the pending Business Combination with GBT. However, if the pending Business Combination with GBT is not consummated, the increased cost and decreased availability of directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate another initial business combination. In order to obtain directors and officers liability insurance or modify its coverage as a result of becoming a public company, the post-business combination entity might need to incur greater expense, accept less favorable terms or both. However, any failure to obtain adequate directors and officers liability insurance could have an adverse impact on the post-business combination\u2019s ability to attract and retain qualified officers and directors.\nIn addition, if our pending Business Combination with GBT is not consummated and we proceed with another business combination, even after we were to complete an initial business combination, our directors and officers could still be subject to potential liability from claims arising from conduct alleged to have occurred prior to the initial business combination. As a result, in order to protect our directors and officers, the post-business combination entity may need to purchase additional insurance with respect to any such claims (\u201c\nrun-off insurance\n\u201d). The need for run-off insurance would be an added expense for the post-business combination entity, and could interfere with or frustrate our ability to consummate an initial business combination on terms favorable to our investors.\nRisks Relating to Our Securities\nThe NYSE may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur Units, Class\u00a0A ordinary shares and warrants are listed on the NYSE. Although we expect to continue to meet NYSE listing standards, we cannot assure you that our securities will continue to be listed on the NYSE in the future or prior to our initial business combination. In order to continue listing our securities on the NYSE prior to our initial business combination, we must maintain certain financial, distribution and stock price levels. Generally, we must maintain a minimum number of holders of our securities (generally 300 round lot holders). Additionally, in connection with our initial business combination, we are required to demonstrate compliance with the NYSE\u2019s initial listing requirements, which are more rigorous than the NYSE\u2019s continued listing requirements, in order to continue to maintain the listing of our securities on the NYSE. For instance, our stock price would generally be required to be at least $4.00 per share, our aggregate market value would be required to be at least $100,000,000, and the market value of our publicly held shares would be required to be at least $80,000,000. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those initial listing requirements at that time.\nIf the NYSE delists our securities from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect our securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf\na limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u25cf\nreduced liquidity for our securities;\n\u25cf\na determination that our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares are a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares to adhere to more stringent rules\u00a0and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n68\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u25cf\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u25cf\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as \u201ccovered securities.\u201d Because our Units, Class\u00a0A ordinary shares and warrants are listed on the NYSE, our Units, Class\u00a0A ordinary shares and warrants are covered securities. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies, other than the state of Idaho, certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states. Further, if we were no longer listed on the NYSE, our securities would not be covered securities and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.\nOur investors are not entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of many other blank check companies.\nSince the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants are intended to be used to complete an initial business combination, we may be deemed to be a \u201cblank check\u201d company under the United States securities laws. However, because we have net tangible assets in excess of $5,000,000, we are exempt from rules\u00a0promulgated by the SEC to protect investors in blank check companies, such as Rule\u00a0419. Accordingly, investors will not be afforded the benefits or protections of those rules. Among other things, this means we have a longer period of time to complete our initial business combination than do companies subject to Rule\u00a0419. Moreover, if the Initial Public Offering were subject to Rule\u00a0419, that rule\u00a0would prohibit the release of any interest earned on funds held in the trust account to us unless and until the funds in the trust account were released to us upon the completion of our initial business combination.\nOur shareholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them upon redemption of their shares.\nIf we are forced to enter into an insolvent liquidation, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed as an unlawful payment if it was proved that immediately following the date on which the distribution was made, we were unable to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. As a result, a liquidator could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to us or our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing themselves and our company to claims, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. We and our directors and officers who knowingly and willfully authorized or permitted any distribution to be paid out of our share premium account while we were unable to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business would be guilty of an offence and may be liable to a fine of up to approximately $18,300 and to imprisonment for five\u00a0years in the Cayman Islands.\nWe may not hold an annual meeting of shareholders until after the consummation of our initial business combination, which could delay the opportunity for our shareholders to elect directors.\nIn accordance with the NYSE corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual meeting until no later than one\u00a0year after our first fiscal\u00a0year end following our listing on the NYSE. There is no requirement under the Companies Act for us to hold annual or general meetings or elect directors. Until we hold an annual meeting of shareholders, public shareholders may not be afforded the opportunity to discuss company affairs with management. In addition, as holders of our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares, our public shareholders will not have the right to vote on the election or removal of directors prior to consummation of our initial business combination.\n69\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe have not registered Class\u00a0A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws at this time, and such registration may not be in place when an investor desires to exercise warrants, thus precluding such investor from being able to exercise its warrants except on a cashless basis and potentially causing such warrants to expire worthless.\nWe have not registered Class\u00a0A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws at this time. However, under the terms of the warrant agreement, we have agreed to use our best efforts to file a registration statement under the Securities Act covering such shares and maintain a current prospectus relating to the Class\u00a0A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants, until the expiration or redemption of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. We cannot assure investors that we will be able to do so if, for example, any facts or events arise which represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement or prospectus, the financial statements contained or incorporated by reference therein are not current, complete or correct or the SEC issues a stop order. If the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities Act, we will be required to permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, in which case, the number of Class\u00a0A ordinary shares that holders will receive upon cashless exercise will be based on a formula subject to a maximum amount of shares equal to 0.361 Class\u00a0A ordinary shares per warrant (subject to adjustment). However, no warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption from registration is available. Notwithstanding the above, if our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a \u201ccovered security\u201d under Section\u00a018(b)(1)\u00a0of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, require holders of public warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a \u201ccashless basis\u201d in accordance with Section\u00a03(a)(9)\u00a0of the Securities Act and, in the event we so elect, we will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but we will be required to use our commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. In no event will we be required to net cash settle any warrant, or issue securities or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event that we are unable to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws, and there is no applicable exemption available. If the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the warrants is not so registered or qualified or exempt from registration or qualification, the holder of such warrant shall not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In such event, holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase of Units will have paid the full unit purchase price solely for the Class\u00a0A ordinary shares included in the Units. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws.\nThe grant of registration rights to our initial shareholders may make it more difficult to complete our initial business combination, and the future exercise of such rights may adversely affect the market price of our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares.\nPursuant to an agreement entered into concurrently with the issuance and sale of the securities in the Initial Public Offering, our initial shareholders and their permitted transferees can demand that we register the Class\u00a0A ordinary shares into which Class\u00a0B ordinary shares are convertible, holders of our Private Placement Warrants and their permitted transferees can demand that we register the Private Placement Warrants and the Class\u00a0A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Private Placement Warrants and holders of warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans may demand that we register such warrants or the Class\u00a0A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of such warrants. Assuming the Class\u00a0B ordinary shares convert on a one for one basis and no warrants are issued upon conversion of working capital loans, an aggregate of up to 20,420,250 Class\u00a0A ordinary shares and up to 12,224,134 warrants are subject to registration under these agreements. We will bear the cost of registering these securities. The registration and availability of such a significant number of securities for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares. In addition, the existence of the registration rights may make our initial business combination more costly or difficult to conclude. This is because the shareholders of the target business may increase the equity stake they seek in the combined entity or ask for more cash consideration to offset the negative impact on the market price of our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares that is expected when the securities owned by our initial shareholders, holders of our Private Placement Warrants, holders of working capital loans or their respective permitted transferees are registered.\n70\n\n\nTable of Contents\nUnlike some other similarly structured blank check companies, our initial shareholders will receive additional Class\u00a0A ordinary shares if we issue shares to consummate our initial business combination.\nThe Class\u00a0B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class\u00a0A ordinary shares at the time of completion of our initial business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like and subject to further adjustment as provided herein. In the case that additional Class\u00a0A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities convertible or exercisable for Class\u00a0A ordinary shares are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts sold in the Initial Public Offering and related to the closing of our initial business combination, the ratio at which Class\u00a0B ordinary shares will convert into Class\u00a0A ordinary shares will be adjusted so that the number of Class\u00a0A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all Class\u00a0B ordinary shares will equal, in the aggregate, 20% of the sum of our ordinary shares outstanding upon completion of the Initial Public Offering plus the number of Class\u00a0A ordinary shares and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with our initial business combination, excluding any Class\u00a0A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in our initial business combination.\nWe may issue notes or other debt securities, or otherwise incur substantial debt, to complete a business combination, which may adversely affect our leverage and financial condition and thus negatively impact the value of our shareholders\u2019 investment in us.\nAlthough we have no commitments as of the date of this annual report to issue any notes or other debt securities, or to otherwise incur outstanding debt, we may choose to incur substantial debt to complete our business combination. We and our officers have agreed that we will not incur any indebtedness unless we have obtained from the lender a waiver of any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to the monies held in the trust account. As such, no issuance of debt will affect the per share amount available for redemption from the trust account. Nevertheless, the incurrence of debt could have a variety of negative effects, including:\n\u25cf\ndefault and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;\n\u25cf\nacceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;\n\u25cf\nour immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand;\n\u25cf\nour inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding;\n\u25cf\nour inability to pay dividends on our ordinary shares;\n\u25cf\nusing a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our ordinary shares if declared, to pay expenses, make capital expenditures and acquisitions and fund other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf\nlimitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate;\n\u25cf\nincreased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation;\n\u25cf\nlimitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, and execution of our strategy; and\n\u25cf\nother disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.\n71\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, Apollo and its affiliates and certain of the Apollo Funds engage in the business of originating, underwriting, syndicating, acquiring and trading loans and debt securities of corporate and other borrowers, and may provide or participate in any debt financing arrangement in connection with any acquisition, financing or disposition of any target business that we may make. If Apollo or any of its affiliates or the Apollo Funds provides or participates in any such debt financing arrangement it may present a conflict of interest and will have to be approved under our related person transaction policy or by our independent directors.\nOur initial shareholders will control the election and removal of our board of directors until consummation of our initial business combination and will hold a substantial interest in us. As a result, they will elect all of our directors and may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring shareholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support.\nAs of the date of this annual report, our initial shareholders owned 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares. In addition, the Class\u00a0B ordinary shares, all of which are held by our initial shareholders, will (i)\u00a0entitle the holders to elect all of our directors prior to our initial business combination and (ii)\u00a0in a vote to continue the company in a jurisdiction outside the Cayman Islands (which requires the approval of at least two thirds of the votes of all ordinary shares), entitle the holders to ten votes for every Class\u00a0B ordinary share. Holders of our public shares will have no right to vote on the election or removal of directors during such time. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may only be amended by a special resolution passed by a majority of at least 90% of our ordinary shares voting in a general meeting. As a result, you will not have any influence over the election or removal of directors or our continuation in a jurisdiction outside the Cayman Islands prior to our initial business combination.\nAs a result of their substantial ownership in our company, our initial shareholders may exert a substantial influence on other actions requiring a shareholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support, including amendments to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and approval of major corporate transactions. If our initial shareholders purchase any additional ordinary shares in the aftermarket or in privately negotiated transactions, this would increase their influence over these actions. Accordingly, our initial shareholders will exert significant influence over actions requiring a shareholder vote at least until the completion of our initial business combination.\nAnti-dilutions provisions of the Class\u00a0B ordinary shares and other securities may result in additional dilution to holders of our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares.\nOur sponsor acquired the Class\u00a0B ordinary shares at a nominal price, significantly contributing to the dilution of holders of our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares. This dilution would increase to the extent that the anti-dilution provisions of the Class\u00a0B ordinary shares result in the issuance of Class\u00a0A ordinary shares on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the Class\u00a0B ordinary shares at the time of completion of our initial business combination and would become exacerbated to the extent that public shareholders seek redemptions from the trust for their public shares. In addition, because of the anti-dilution protection in the Class\u00a0B ordinary shares, any equity or equity-linked securities issued in connection with our initial business combination would be disproportionately dilutive to our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares.\nWe may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders of public warrants with the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants. As a result, the exercise price of your warrants could be increased, the exercise period could be shortened and the number of our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares purchasable upon exercise of a warrant could be decreased, all without your approval.\nOur warrants were issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer\u00a0& Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders of public warrants. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the public warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants approve of such amendment. Although our ability to amend the terms of the public warrants with the consent of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, convert the warrants into cash, shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares purchasable upon exercise of a warrant. Please see \u201cItem\u00a01. Business\n\u2014\nPermitted Purchases of our Securities.\u201d\n72\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur warrant agreement designates the courts of the City of New York, County of New York, State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by holders of our warrants, which could limit the ability of warrant holders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with our company.\nOur warrant agreement provides that, subject to applicable law, (i)\u00a0any action, proceeding or claim against us arising out of or relating in any way to the warrant agreement, including under the Securities Act, will be brought and enforced in the courts of the City of New York, County of New York, State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and (ii)\u00a0that we irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction shall be the exclusive forum for any such action, proceeding or claim. We will waive any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and that such courts represent an inconvenient forum.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, these provisions of the warrant agreement do not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our warrants shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the forum provisions in our warrant agreement. If any action, the subject matter of which is within the scope the forum provisions of the warrant agreement, is filed in a court other than a court of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (a \u201c\nforeign action\n\u201d) in the name of any holder of our warrants, such holder shall be deemed to have consented to: (x)\u00a0the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of New York in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions (an \u201c\nenforcement action\n\u201d), and (y)\u00a0having service of process made upon such warrant holder in any such enforcement action by service upon such warrant holder\u2019s counsel in the foreign action as agent for such warrant holder.\nThis choice-of-forum provision may limit a warrant holder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with our company, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our warrant agreement inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors.\nWe may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your warrants worthless.\nWe have the ability to redeem issued and outstanding warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per warrant if, among other things, the last reported sale price of the Class A ordinary shares (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending three business days before we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders (the \u201c\nReference Value\n\u201d) equals or exceeds $18.00 per share. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. As a result, we may redeem the warrants as set forth above even if the holders are otherwise unable to exercise the warrants. Redemption of the issued and outstanding warrants could force you (i) to exercise your warrants and pay the exercise price therefore at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so, (ii) to sell your warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the issued and outstanding warrants are called for redemption, we expect would be substantially less than the market value of your warrants. None of the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by our sponsor or its permitted transferees.\nIn addition, we have the ability to redeem the outstanding warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.10 per warrant if, among other things, the Reference Value equals or exceeds $10.00 per share. In such a case, the holders will be able to exercise their warrants prior to redemption for a number of Class A ordinary shares determined based on the redemption date and the fair market value of our Class A ordinary shares. The value received upon exercise of the warrants (1) may be less than the value the holders would have received if they had exercised their warrants at a later time where the underlying share price is higher and (2) may not compensate the holders for the value of the warrants, including because the number of ordinary shares received is capped at 0.361 Class A ordinary shares per warrant (subject to adjustment) irrespective of the remaining life of the warrants.\n73\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur warrants and Class\u00a0B ordinary shares may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares and make it more difficult to effectuate our business combination.\nWe issued warrants to purchase 27,227,000 Class\u00a0A ordinary shares as part of the Units offered in the Initial Public Offering and we issued in a private placement an aggregate of 12,224,134 Private Placement Warrants, each exercisable to purchase one Class\u00a0A ordinary share at $11.50 per share. The Class\u00a0B ordinary shares are convertible into Class\u00a0A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like and subject to further adjustment as set forth herein. In addition, if our sponsor makes any working capital loans, it may convert those loans into up to an additional 1,000,000 Private Placement Warrants, at the price of $1.50 per warrant. To the extent we issue Class\u00a0A ordinary shares to effectuate a business combination, the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional Class\u00a0A ordinary shares upon exercise of these warrants and conversion rights could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle to a target business. Any such issuance will increase the number of issued and outstanding Class\u00a0A ordinary shares and reduce the value of the Class\u00a0A ordinary shares issued to complete the business combination. Therefore, our warrants and Class\u00a0B ordinary shares may make it more difficult to effectuate a business combination or increase the cost of acquiring the target business.\nBecause each unit contains one-third of one warrant and only a whole warrant may be exercised, the Units may be worth less than units of other blank check companies.\nEach unit contains one-third of one warrant. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, no fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units, and only whole warrants will trade. This is different from other offerings similar to ours whose units include one ordinary share and one warrant to purchase one whole share. We have established the components of the Units in this way in order to reduce the dilutive effect of the warrants upon completion of a business combination since the warrants will be exercisable in the aggregate for one-third of the number of shares compared to units that each contain a whole warrant to purchase one share, thus making us, we believe, a more attractive merger partner for target businesses. Nevertheless, this unit structure may cause our Units to be worth less than if they included a warrant to purchase one whole share.\nBecause we must furnish our shareholders with target business financial statements, we may lose the ability to complete an otherwise advantageous initial business combination with some prospective target businesses.\nThe federal proxy rules\u00a0require that a proxy statement with respect to a vote on a business combination meeting certain financial significance tests include target historical and/or pro forma financial statement disclosure. We will include the same financial statement disclosure in connection with our tender offer documents, whether or not they are required under the tender offer rules. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, or international financial reporting standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such financial statements in time for us to disclose such financial statements in accordance with federal proxy rules\u00a0and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame.\nCompliance obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may make it more difficult for us to effectuate our business combination, require substantial financial and management resources, and increase the time and costs of completing our initial business combination.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls and comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting beginning with our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. The fact that we are a blank check company makes compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly burdensome for us as compared to other public companies because a target business with which we seek to complete our business combination may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls. The development of the internal control of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.\n74\n\n\nTable of Contents\nProvisions in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares and could entrench management.\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that shareholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include a staggered board, three-year director terms and the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred shares, which may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.\nRisks Associated with our Status as a Foreign Entity\nBecause we are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, you may face difficulties in protecting your interests, and your ability to protect your rights through the U.S. Federal courts may be limited.\nWe are an exempted limited company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon our directors or officers, or enforce judgments obtained in the United States courts against our directors or officers.\nOur corporate affairs are governed by our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, the Companies Act (as the same may be supplemented or amended from time to time) and the common law of the Cayman Islands. We are also subject to the federal securities laws of the United States. The rights of shareholders to take action against the directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by statutory law and the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law, the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority, but are not binding on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are different from what they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a different body of securities laws as compared to the United States, and certain states, such as Delaware, may have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholders derivative action in a Federal court of the United States.\nWe have been advised by our Cayman Islands legal counsel that the courts of the Cayman Islands are unlikely (i)\u00a0to recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state; and (ii)\u00a0in original actions brought in the Cayman Islands, to impose liabilities against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state, so far as the liabilities imposed by those provisions are penal in nature. In those circumstances, although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce a foreign money judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle that a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes upon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided certain conditions are met. For a foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated sum, and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a Cayman Islands judgment in respect of the same matter, impeachable on the grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, or be of a kind the enforcement of which is, contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to public policy). A Cayman Islands Court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere.\nAs a result of all of the above, public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by management, members of the board of directors or controlling shareholders than they would as public shareholders of a United States company.\n75\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAfter our initial business combination, it is possible that a majority of our directors and officers will live outside the United States and all of our assets will be located outside the United States; therefore investors may not be able to enforce federal securities laws or their other legal rights.\nIt is possible that after our initial business combination, a majority of our directors and officers will reside outside of the United States and all of our assets will be located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult, or in some cases not possible, for investors in the United States to enforce their legal rights, to effect service of process upon all of our directors or officers or to enforce judgments of United States courts predicated upon civil liabilities and criminal penalties on our directors and officers under United States laws.\nWe may pursue a business combination with a target business in any geographic location. If we effect our initial business combination with a company with operations or opportunities outside of the United States, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations.\nIf we effect our initial business combination with a company with operations or opportunities outside of the United States, we would be subject to any special considerations or risks associated with companies operating in an international setting, including any of the following:\n\u25cf\ncosts and difficulties inherent in managing cross-border business operations and complying with difficult commercial and legal requirements of the overseas market;\n\u25cf\nrules\u00a0and regulations regarding currency redemption;\n\u25cf\ncomplex corporate withholding taxes on individuals;\n\u25cf\nlaws governing the manner in which future business combinations may be effected;\n\u25cf\nexchange listing and/or delisting requirements;\n\u25cf\ntariffs and trade barriers;\n\u25cf\nregulations related to customs and import/export matters;\n\u25cf\nlocal or regional economic policies and market conditions;\n\u25cf\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf\nlonger payment cycles;\n\u25cf\ntax issues, such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws as compared to the United States;\n\u25cf\ncurrency fluctuations and exchange controls;\n\u25cf\nrates of inflation;\n\u25cf\nchallenges in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u25cf\ncultural and language differences;\n\u25cf\nemployment regulations;\n76\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u25cf\nunderdeveloped or unpredictable legal or regulatory systems;\n\u25cf\ncorruption;\n\u25cf\nprotection of intellectual property;\n\u25cf\nsocial unrest, crime, strikes, riots and civil disturbances;\n\u25cf\nterrorist attacks, natural disasters and wars;\n\u25cf\ndeterioration of political relations with the United States; and\n\u25cf\ngovernment appropriation of assets.\nWe may not be able to adequately address these additional risks. If we were unable to do so, our operations might suffer, which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our management following our initial business combination is unfamiliar with United States securities laws, they may have to expend time and resources becoming familiar with such laws, which could lead to various regulatory issues.\nFollowing our initial business combination, our management may resign from their positions as officers or directors of the company and the management of the target business at the time of the business combination will remain in place. Management of the target business may not be familiar with United States securities laws. If new management is unfamiliar with United States securities laws, they may have to expend time and resources becoming familiar with such laws. This could be expensive and time-consuming and could lead to various regulatory issues which may adversely affect our operations.\nAfter our initial business combination, substantially all of our assets may be located in a foreign country and substantially all of our revenue will be derived from our operations in such country. Accordingly, our results of operations and prospects will be subject, to a significant extent, to the economic, political and legal policies, developments and conditions in the country in which we operate.\nThe economic, political and social conditions, as well as government policies, of the country in which our operations are located could affect our business. Economic growth could be uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy and such growth may not be sustained in the future. If in the future such country\u2019s economy experiences a downturn or grows at a slower rate than expected, there may be less demand for spending in certain industries. A decrease in demand for spending in certain industries could materially and adversely affect our ability to find an attractive target business with which to consummate our initial business combination and if we effect our initial business combination, the ability of that target business to become profitable.\nExchange rate fluctuations and currency policies may cause a target business\u2019 ability to succeed in the international markets to be diminished.\nIn the event we acquire a non-U.S. target, all revenues and income would likely be received in a foreign currency, and the dollar equivalent of our net assets and distributions, if any, could be adversely affected by reductions in the value of the local currency. The value of the currencies in non-U.S. regions fluctuates and is affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions. Any change in the relative value of such currency against our reporting currency may affect the attractiveness of any target business or, following consummation of our initial business combination, our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if a currency appreciates in value against the dollar prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, the cost of a target business as measured in dollars will increase, which may make it less likely that we are able to consummate such transaction.\n77\n\n\nTable of Contents\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe are a blank check company with no operating history and no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.\nWe are a blank check company established under the laws of the Cayman Islands with no operating results, and we will not commence operations until completing a business combination. Because we lack an operating history, you have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective of completing our initial business combination with one or more target businesses. If we fail to complete our initial business combination, we will never generate any operating revenues.\nPast performance by Apollo, Apollo Funds, Spartan Acquisition Corp.

Apollo and our officers and directors have had limited experience with blank check companies or special purpose acquisition companies in the past.\nWe may be a passive foreign investment company, or \u201cPFIC,\u201d which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. investors.\nIf we are a PFIC for any taxable\u00a0year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period of a U.S. holder (as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) of our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares or warrants, the U.S. holder may be subject to certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences and may be subject to additional reporting requirements. Our PFIC status for our current and subsequent taxable\u00a0years may depend on whether we qualify for the PFIC start-up exception. Depending on the particular circumstances, the application of the start-up exception may be subject to uncertainty, and there cannot be any assurance that we will qualify for the start-up exception. Additionally, even if we qualify for the start-up exception with respect to a given taxable\u00a0year, there cannot be any assurance that we would not be a PFIC in other taxable\u00a0years. Accordingly, there can be no assurances with respect to our status as a PFIC for our current taxable\u00a0year or any subsequent taxable\u00a0year. Our actual PFIC status for any taxable\u00a0year will not be determinable until after the end of such taxable\u00a0year. Moreover, if we determine we are a PFIC for any taxable\u00a0year, we will endeavor to provide to a U.S. holder such information as the Internal Revenue Service (\u201c\nIRS\n\u201d) may require, including a PFIC annual information statement, in order to enable the U.S. holder to make and maintain a \u201cqualified electing fund\u201d election with respect to their Class\u00a0A ordinary shares, but there can be no assurance that we will timely provide such required information, and such election would likely be unavailable with respect to our warrants in all cases. We urge U.S. holders to consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible application of the PFIC rules\u00a0to holders of our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares and warrants.\nWe may reincorporate in another jurisdiction in connection with our initial business combination and such reincorporation may result in taxes imposed on shareholders.\nWe may, in connection with our initial business combination and subject to requisite shareholder approval under the Companies Act, reincorporate in the jurisdiction in which the target company or business is located, or in another jurisdiction. The transaction may require a shareholder to recognize taxable income in the jurisdiction in which the shareholder is a tax resident or in which its members are resident if it is a tax transparent entity. We do not intend to make any cash distributions to shareholders to pay such taxes. Shareholders may be subject to withholding taxes or other taxes with respect to their ownership of us after the reincorporation.\n78\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCyber incidents or attacks directed at us could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nWe depend on digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications and services, including those of third parties with which we may deal. Sophisticated and deliberate attacks on, or security breaches in, our systems or infrastructure, or the systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud, could lead to corruption or misappropriation of our assets, proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data. As an early stage company without significant investments in data security protection, we may not be sufficiently protected against such occurrences. We may not have sufficient resources to adequately protect against, or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to, cyber incidents. It is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have adverse consequences on our business and lead to financial loss.\nWe are subject to changing law and regulations regarding regulatory matters, corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of non-compliance.\nWe are subject to rules\u00a0and regulations by various governing bodies, including, for example, the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded, and to new and evolving regulatory measures under applicable law. Our efforts to comply with new and changing laws and regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nMoreover, because these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices. If we fail to address and comply with these regulations and any subsequent changes, we may be subject to penalty and our business may be harmed.\nWe employ a mail forwarding service, which may delay or disrupt our ability to receive mail in a timely manner.\nMail addressed to the company and received at its registered office will be forwarded unopened to the forwarding address supplied by company to be dealt with. None of the company, its directors, officers, advisors or service providers (including the organization which provides registered office services in the Cayman Islands) will bear any responsibility for any delay howsoever caused in mail reaching the forwarding address, which may impair your ability to communicate with us.\n\u200b", "item7": ">Item\u00a07. Results of Operations\u201d in our 2020 10-K/A.\n84\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, we had cash of $161,277 and $257,872, respectively, held outside the trust account. We intend to use the funds held outside the trust account primarily identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses and structure, negotiate and complete an initial business combination.\nIn order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection an initial business combination, our initial shareholders or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, as may be required. If we complete an initial business combination, we will repay such loaned amounts. In the event that an initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants identical to the Private Placement Warrants at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender.\nWe do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating an initial business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our initial business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of Class\u00a0A ordinary shares included in the Units upon consummation of our initial business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such initial business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. In addition, following our initial business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations.\nOff-balance Sheet Financing Arrangements\nWe have no obligations, assets or liabilities that would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of December\u00a031, 2021. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets.\nContractual Obligations\nWe do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations, purchase obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay an affiliate of \nour sponso\nr a\u00a0monthly fee of $16,667, for office space, administrative and support services. We began incurring these fees on October\u00a02, 2020 and will continue to incur these fees\u00a0monthly for up to 27\u00a0months until the earlier of the completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation.\nThe underwriters are entitled to a deferred underwriting commission of $28,588,350. The deferred fee will be waived by the underwriters in the event that we do not complete an initial business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.\nThe Company has entered into a fee arrangement with a service provider pursuant to which certain success fees in connection with a potential Business Combination will become payable only if the Company consummates the pending Business Combination with GBT. If the pending Business Combination with GBT does not occur, the Company will not be required to pay these contingent fees. As of December 31, 2021, the amount of these contingent fees with the service provider was approximately $7.0 million.\nSeparately, the Company has entered into a fee arrangement with placement agents pursuant to which certain placement fees equal to 3.5% of gross proceeds from a securities private placement (net of proceeds invested by related parties or affiliates of the Company) will become payable only if the Company consummates the pending Business Combination with GBT. If the pending Business Combination with GBT does not occur, the Company will not be required to pay these contingent fees.\n85\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Policies\nAccounting policies, methods and estimates are an integral part of the financial statements prepared by management and are based upon management\u2019s current judgments. These judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience regarding past and current events and assumptions about future events. Certain accounting policies, methods and estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ from management\u2019s current judgments. While there are a number of accounting policies, methods and estimates that affect our financial statements, the areas that are particularly significant include use of estimates; Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption; net income (loss) per ordinary share; and the fair value of assets and liabilities.\nOur significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to our financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nIn August\u00a02020, the FASB issued ASU No.\u00a02020-06,\u00a0\nDebt\u00a0--Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging\u00a0--Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity\n\u00a0(\u201c\nASU 2020-06\n\u201d), which simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. The ASU also removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity-linked contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, and it simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 on January\u00a01, 2021. Adoption of the ASU did not impact the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company\u2019s financial statements.\n\u200b", "item7a": ">Item\u00a07A.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, we were not subject to any market or interest rate risk. Following the consummation of our Initial Public Offering, the net proceeds of our Initial Public Offering, including amounts in the trust account, have been invested in U.S. government obligations with a maturity of 185\u00a0days or less or in certain money market funds that invest solely in U.S. treasuries. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe there will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk.\n\u200b", "companyName": "GLOBAL BUSINESS TRAVEL GROUP", "cusip": "37954Y442"}
