The Firm\u2019s consumer business is the Consumer & Community Banking (\u201cCCB\u201d) segment. The Firm\u2019s wholesale business segments are the Corporate & Investment Bank (\u201cCIB\u201d), Commercial Banking (\u201cCB\u201d), and Asset & Wealth Management (\u201cAWM\u201d).\nA description of the Firm\u2019s business segments and the products and services they provide to their respective client bases is provided in the \u201cBusiness segment results\u201d section of Management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (\u201cManagement\u2019s discussion and analysis\u201d or \u201cMD&A\u201d), beginning on page 46 and in Note 32.\nCompetition\nJPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries and affiliates operate in highly competitive environments. Competitors include other banks, brokerage firms, investment banking companies, merchant banks, hedge funds, commodity trading companies, private equity firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, investment managers, credit card companies, mortgage banking companies, trust companies, securities processing companies, automobile financing companies, leasing companies, e-commerce and other internet-based companies, financial technology companies, and other companies engaged in providing similar and new products and services. The Firm\u2019s businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of the Firm\u2019s products and services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Competition also varies based on the types of clients, customers, industries and geographies served. With respect to some of its geographies and products, JPMorgan Chase competes globally; with respect to others, the Firm competes on a national or regional basis. New competitors in the financial services industry continue to emerge, including firms that offer products and services solely through the internet and non-financial companies that offer payment or loan products.\n1\nPart I\nHuman capital\nJPMorgan Chase believes that its long-term growth and success depend on its ability to attract, develop and retain a high-performing and diverse workforce, with inclusion and accessibility as key components of the way the Firm does business.

The Firm maintains its focus on its culture of inclusion and respect, which is reinforced by its Code of Conduct and through increasing employee awareness and education, communication and training. An important part of these efforts includes the Firm\u2019s Business Resource Groups, which are groups of employees who support JPMorgan Chase\u2019s diversity, equity and inclusion strategies by leveraging the unique perspectives of their members. The Firm has global Diversity, Equity & Inclusion centers of excellence, several of which were launched in 2021, that lead the Firm\u2019s strategy in supporting its commitments to create more equity and lasting impact in communities, and strengthen its inclusive culture.\nAttracting and retaining employees\nThe goal of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s recruitment efforts is to attract and hire talented individuals in all roles and at all career levels. The Firm strives to provide both external candidates and internal employees who are seeking a different role with challenging and stimulating career opportunities. These opportunities range from internship training programs for students to entry-level, management and executive careers. During 2021, approximately two thirds of the Firm\u2019s employment opportunities were filled by external candidates, with the remainder filled by existing employees.\nDiversity is an important area of focus throughout the Firm\u2019s hiring process. JPMorgan Chase engages in efforts aimed at hiring diverse talent, including initiatives focused on gender, underrepresented ethnic groups, LGBT+ individuals, people with disabilities, veterans and others. The Firm\u2019s global Diversity, Equity & Inclusion centers of excellence seek to increase representation of and advance career opportunities for talented diverse individuals across the Firm through initiatives such as career coaching and mentorship. \nJPMorgan Chase offers a competitive fellowship program that seeks to attract accomplished individuals who have taken a career break and wish to return to the workforce.  In addition, where appropriate, the Firm\u2019s hiring practices focus on the skills of a job candidate rather than degrees held.\nDeveloping employees\nJPMorgan Chase supports the professional development and career growth of its employees. An onboarding training curriculum is required for new hires, which covers Code of Conduct, compliance and cybersecurity, among other topics. In addition, the Firm offers extensive training programs to all employees, covering a broad variety of topics such as leadership, change management, analytical thinking, culture and conduct, diversity, equity and inclusion, and risk and controls. Leadership Edge, the Firm\u2019s global leadership development Center of Excellence, is focused on creating one Firm leadership culture.\nCompensation and benefits\nThe Firm provides market-competitive compensation and benefits programs. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s compensation philosophy provides the guiding principles that drive compensation-related decisions across the Firm, including pay-for-performance, responsiveness and alignment with shareholder interests, reinforcement of the Firm\u2019s culture and How We Do Business Principles, and integration of risk, controls and conduct considerations. The Firm\u2019s commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion for all employees includes compensation review processes that seek to ensure that the Firm\u2019s employees are paid equitably and competitively for the work they do.\nThe Firm also supports employees\u2019 well-being. JPMorgan Chase offers an extensive benefits and wellness package to employees and their families, including healthcare coverage, retirement benefits, life and disability insurance, on-site health and wellness centers, employee assistance programs, competitive vacation and leave policies, backup child care arrangements, tuition reimbursement programs, mental health counseling and support, and financial coaching. The Firm has taken action to protect and support its employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, including continued implementation of health and safety protocols, and providing additional benefits. For more information on the Firm\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Business Developments on page 50. \n3\nPart I\nSupervision and regulation\nThe Firm is subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation under U.S. federal and state laws, as well as the applicable laws of the jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the Firm does business.  \nFinancial holding company:\nConsolidated supervision\n. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a bank holding company (\u201cBHC\u201d) and a financial holding company (\u201cFHC\u201d) under U.S. federal law, and is subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the \u201cFederal Reserve\u201d). The Federal Reserve acts as the supervisor of the consolidated operations of BHCs. Certain of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s subsidiaries are also regulated directly by additional authorities based on the activities or licenses of those subsidiaries.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s national bank subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., is supervised and regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d) and, with respect to certain matters, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the \u201cFDIC\u201d).\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s U.S. broker-dealers are supervised and regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d). Subsidiaries of the Firm that engage in certain futures-related and swaps-related activities are supervised and regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d). J.P. Morgan Securities plc is a U.K.-based bank regulated by the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority (the \u201cPRA\u201d) and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d). \nThe Firm\u2019s other non-U.S. subsidiaries are regulated by the banking, securities, prudential and conduct regulatory authorities in the countries in which they operate. \nPermissible business activities\n. The Bank Holding Company Act restricts BHCs from engaging in business activities other than the business of banking and certain closely-related activities. FHCs can engage in a broader range of financial activities. The Federal Reserve has the authority to limit an FHC\u2019s ability to conduct otherwise permissible activities if the FHC or any of its depository institution subsidiaries ceases to meet applicable eligibility requirements. The Federal Reserve may also impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements on the FHC, and if deficiencies are persistent, may require divestiture of the FHC\u2019s depository institutions. If any depository institution controlled by an FHC fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act, the Federal Reserve must prohibit the FHC and its subsidiaries from engaging in any new activities other than those permissible for BHCs, or acquiring a company engaged in such activities. \nCapital and liquidity requirements\n. The Federal Reserve establishes capital, liquidity and leverage requirements for JPMorgan Chase that are generally consistent with the \ninternational Basel III capital and liquidity framework and evaluates the Firm\u2019s compliance with those requirements. The OCC establishes similar requirements for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\n Certain of the Firm\u2019s non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches are also subject to local capital and liquidity requirements.\nBanking supervisors globally continue to refine and enhance the Basel III capital framework for financial institutions. In January 2019, the Basel Committee issued \u201cMinimum capital requirements for market risk.\u201d The Basel Committee expects national regulators to \nimplement these revised market risk requirements for banking organizations in their jurisdictions by January 2023, in line with the other elements of the Basel III Reforms. U.S. banking regulators have announced their support for the issuance of the Basel III Reforms and are considering how to appropriately apply such reforms in the U.S.  \nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 and Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 .\nStress tests\n. As a large BHC, JPMorgan Chase is subject to supervisory stress testing administered by the Federal Reserve as part of the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (\u201cCCAR\u201d) framework. The Firm must conduct annual company-run stress tests and must also submit an annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate stress tests designed by the Firm and the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve uses the results under the severely adverse scenario from its supervisory stress test to determine the Firm\u2019s Stress Capital Buffer (\u201cSCB\u201d) requirement for the coming year, which forms part of the Firm\u2019s applicable capital buffers. The Firm is required to file its annual CCAR submission on April 5, 2022. The Federal Reserve will notify the Firm of its indicative SCB requirement by June 30, 2022 and final SCB requirement by August 31, 2022. The Firm\u2019s final SCB requirement will become effective on October 1, 2022. The OCC requires JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to perform separate, similar stress tests annually. The Firm publishes each year the results of the annual stress tests for the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. under the supervisory \u201cseverely adverse\u201d scenarios provided by the Federal Reserve and the OCC.\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for more information concerning the Firm\u2019s CCAR.\nEnhanced prudential standards\n. As part of its mandate to identify and monitor risks to the financial stability of the U.S. posed by large banking organizations, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (\u201cFSOC\u201d) recommends prudential standards and reporting requirements to the Federal Reserve for systemically important financial institutions (\u201cSIFIs\u201d), such as JPMorgan Chase. The Federal Reserve has adopted several rules to implement those heightened prudential standards, including rules relating to risk management and corporate governance of subject BHCs. JPMorgan Chase is required under these rules to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk \n4\nmanagement standards, including oversight by the board of directors of risk management activities.\nResolution and recovery\n. The Firm is required to maintain a comprehensive recovery plan, updated annually, summarizing the actions it would take to avoid failure by remaining well-capitalized and well-funded in the case of an adverse event. In addition, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to prepare and submit a recovery plan as directed by the OCC. The Firm is required to submit periodically to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a plan for resolution in the event of material distress or failure (a \u201cresolution plan\u201d). In 2019, the FDIC and Federal Reserve revised the regulations governing resolution plan requirements, and on the basis of those revisions, the Firm\u2019s resolution plan submissions will alternate between \u201ctargeted\u201d and \u201cfull\u201d plans. The Firm\u2019s \u201ctargeted\u201d resolution plan was filed on June 28, 2021. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is also required to prepare and submit a separate resolution plan as directed by the FDIC. \nCertain of the Firm\u2019s non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches are also subject to local resolution and recovery planning requirements.\nOrderly liquidation authority\n. Certain financial companies, including JPMorgan Chase and certain of its subsidiaries, can also be subjected to resolution under an \u201corderly liquidation authority.\u201d The U.S. Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the President of the United States, must first make certain determinations concerning extraordinary financial distress and systemic risk, and action must be recommended by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve. Absent such actions, the Firm, as a BHC, would remain subject to resolution under the Bankruptcy Code. The FDIC has issued a draft policy statement describing its \u201csingle point of entry\u201d strategy for resolution of SIFIs under the orderly liquidation authority, which seeks to keep operating subsidiaries of a BHC open and impose losses on shareholders and creditors of the BHC in receivership according to their statutory order of priority.  \nHolding company as a source of strength.\n JPMorgan Chase & Co. is required to serve as a source of financial strength for its depository institution subsidiaries and to commit resources to support those subsidiaries, including when directed to do so by the Federal Reserve. \nRegulation of acquisitions\n. Acquisitions by BHCs and their banks are subject to requirements, limitations and prohibitions established by law and by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. For example, FHCs and BHCs are required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve before they acquire more than 5% of the voting shares of an unaffiliated bank. In addition, acquisitions by financial companies are prohibited if, as a result of the acquisition, the total liabilities of the financial company would exceed 10% of the total liabilities of all financial companies. Furthermore, for certain acquisitions, the Firm must provide written notice to the Federal Reserve prior to acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any \nvoting shares of any company with over $10 billion in assets that is engaged in activities that are \u201cfinancial in nature.\u201d\nOngoing obligations\n. The Firm is subject to obligations under the terms of a Deferred Prosecution Agreement entered into with the Department of Justice on September 29, 2020 relating to precious metals and U.S. Treasuries markets investigations as well as under a related order issued by the CFTC.\nSubsidiary banks: \nThe activities of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the Firm\u2019s principal subsidiary bank, are limited to those specifically authorized under the National Bank Act and related interpretations of the OCC. The OCC has authority to bring an enforcement\u00a0action against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. for unsafe or unsound banking practices, which could include limiting JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s ability to conduct otherwise permissible activities, or imposing corrective capital or managerial requirements on the bank.\nFDIC deposit insurance.\n The FDIC deposit insurance fund provides insurance coverage for certain deposits and is funded through assessments on banks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. \nFDIC powers upon a bank insolvency.\n Upon the insolvency of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the FDIC could be appointed as conservator or receiver under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The FDIC has broad powers to transfer assets and liabilities without the approval of the institution\u2019s creditors.  \nPrompt corrective action.\n The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards. The Federal Reserve is also authorized to take appropriate action against the parent BHC, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co., based on the undercapitalized status of any bank subsidiary. In certain instances, the BHC would be required to guarantee the performance of the capital restoration plan for its undercapitalized subsidiary. \nOCC Heightened Standards.\n The OCC has established guidelines setting forth heightened standards for large banks, including minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework for banks. Under these standards, a bank\u2019s risk governance framework must ensure that the bank\u2019s risk profile is easily distinguished and separate from that of its parent BHC for risk management purposes. The bank\u2019s board or risk committee is responsible for approving the bank\u2019s risk governance framework, providing active oversight of the bank\u2019s risk-taking activities, and holding management accountable for adhering to the risk governance framework.\nRestrictions on transactions with affiliates. \nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries are subject to restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to, \n5\nPart I\ninvestments in stock or securities of, and derivatives, securities lending and certain other transactions with, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain other affiliates. These restrictions prevent JPMorgan Chase & Co. and other affiliates from borrowing from such subsidiaries unless the loans are secured in specified amounts and comply with certain other requirements. \nDividend restrictions.\n Federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Refer to Note 26 for the amount of dividends that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. could pay, at January 1, 2022, to JPMorgan Chase without the approval of the banking regulators. The OCC and the Federal Reserve also have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends of a bank subsidiary that they supervise if, in the banking regulator\u2019s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the bank. \nDepositor preference.\n Under federal law, the claims of a receiver of an IDI for administrative expense and the claims of holders of U.S. deposit liabilities (including the FDIC and deposits in non-U.S. branches that are dually payable in the U.S. and in a non-U.S. branch) have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution, including depositors in non-U.S. branches and public noteholders. \nConsumer supervision and regulation.\n JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. are subject to supervision and regulation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) with respect to federal consumer protection laws, including laws relating to fair lending and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products and services. The CFPB also has jurisdiction over small business lending activities with respect to fair lending and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. As part of its regulatory oversight, the CFPB has authority to take enforcement actions against firms that offer certain products and services to consumers using practices that are deemed to be unfair, deceptive or abusive. The Firm\u2019s consumer activities are also subject to regulation under state statutes which are enforced by the Attorney General or empowered agency of each state.\nIn September 2021, the Firm launched a retail bank in the U.K. operating through J.P. Morgan Europe Limited (\u201cJPMEL\u201d) and acquired Nutmeg Saving and Investment Limited, a U.K. online digital investment manager (\u201cNutmeg\u201d). JPMEL is regulated by the PRA, and both JPMEL and Nutmeg are regulated by the FCA with respect to their conduct of financial services in the U.K., including obligations relating to the fair treatment of customers. JPMEL is also regulated by the U.K. Payment Systems Regulator with respect to its operation and use of payment systems. In addition, the retail businesses of JPMEL and Nutmeg are subject to U.K. consumer-protection legislation.\nSecurities and broker-dealer regulation: \nThe Firm conducts securities underwriting, dealing and brokerage activities in the U.S. through J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and other non-bank broker-dealer subsidiaries, all of which are subject to regulations of the SEC, FINRA and the New York Stock Exchange, among others. The Firm conducts similar securities activities outside the U.S. subject to local regulatory requirements. In the U.K., those activities are conducted by J.P. Morgan Securities plc. Broker-dealers are subject to laws and regulations covering all aspects of the securities business, including sales and trading practices, securities offerings, publication of research reports, use of customer funds, the financing of client purchases, capital structure, record-keeping and retention, and the conduct of their directors, officers and employees. Refer to Broker-dealer regulatory capital on page 96 for information concerning the capital of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc.\nInvestment management regulation: \nThe Firm\u2019s asset and wealth management businesses are subject to significant regulation in jurisdictions around the world relating to, among other things, the safeguarding and management of client assets, offerings of funds and marketing activities. Certain of the Firm\u2019s subsidiaries are registered with, and subject to oversight by, the SEC as investment advisers and broker-dealers. The Firm\u2019s registered investment advisers are subject to the fiduciary and other obligations imposed under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as well as various state securities laws. The Firm\u2019s bank fiduciary activities are subject to supervision by the OCC. \nDerivatives regulation: \nThe Firm is subject to comprehensive regulation of its derivatives businesses, including regulations that impose capital and margin requirements, require central clearing of standardized over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives, mandate that certain standardized OTC swaps be traded on regulated trading venues, and provide for reporting of certain mandated information. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc are registered with the CFTC as \u201cswap dealers\u201d. In addition, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC registered with the SEC as \u201csecurity-based swap dealers\u201d effective November 2021. As a result, these entities are subject to a comprehensive regulatory framework applicable to their swap or security-based swap activities, including capital requirements, rules requiring the collateralization of uncleared swaps and security-based swaps, rules regarding segregation of counterparty collateral, business conduct and documentation standards, record-keeping and reporting obligations, and anti-fraud and anti-manipulation requirements. Similar requirements have also been established under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (\u201cEMIR\u201d) and MiFID II, as implemented in the EU and as adopted in the U.K. \n6\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC is also registered with the CFTC as a futures commission merchant and is a member of the National Futures Association. \nData, privacy and security regulation: \nThe Firm and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state and local as well as international laws, rules and regulations concerning data that are central to the Firm\u2019s businesses, functions and operations. These include laws, rules and regulations relating to data protection, privacy, data use, confidentiality, secrecy, cybersecurity, technology, artificial intelligence, data localization and storage, data retention and destruction, disclosure, transfer, availability, integrity and other similar matters. Numerous jurisdictions have passed laws, rules and regulations in these areas and many are considering new or updated ones that could affect the Firm\u2019s businesses. Many of these laws apply not only to the Firm\u2019s transactions with third parties but also to interactions between and among the Firm\u2019s own affiliates and subsidiaries. The application, interpretation and enforcement of these laws, rules and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in light of new and rapidly evolving data-driven technologies and significant increase in computing power. These laws, rules and regulations are constantly evolving, remain a focus of regulators globally, may be enforced by private parties or government bodies, and will continue to have a significant impact on all of the Firm\u2019s businesses and operations.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act and Economic Sanctions: \nThe Bank Secrecy Act (\u201cBSA\u201d) requires all financial institutions, including banks and securities broker-dealers, to establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism.

The Firm is also subject to the regulations and economic sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d). In addition, the EU and the U.K. have adopted various economic sanctions programs targeted at entities or individuals that are, or are located in countries that are, involved in terrorism, hostilities, embezzlement or human rights violations. The Firm is also subject to economic sanctions laws, rules and regulations in other jurisdictions in which it operates, including those that conflict with or prohibit a firm such as JPMorgan Chase from complying with certain laws, rules and regulations to which it is otherwise subject.\nAnti-Corruption: \nThe Firm is subject to laws and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments to government officials and others in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act.\nCompensation practices:\n \nThe Firm\u2019s compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve, as well as other agencies. The \nFederal Reserve has jointly issued guidance with the FDIC and the OCC that is designed to ensure that incentive compensation paid by banking organizations does not encourage imprudent risk-taking that threatens the organizations\u2019 safety and soundness. The Financial Stability Board (\u201cFSB\u201d) has also established standards covering compensation principles for banks. The Firm\u2019s compensation practices are also subject to regulation and oversight by regulators in other jurisdictions, notably the Fifth Capital Requirements Directive (\u201cCRD V\u201d), as implemented in the EU and as adopted in the U.K, which includes compensation-related provisions. The European Banking Authority has instituted guidelines on compensation policies including under CRD V which in certain countries, such as Germany, are implemented or supplemented by local regulations or guidelines. The U.K. regulators have also instituted guidelines on CRD V compensation policies. The Firm expects that the implementation of regulatory guidelines regarding compensation in the U.S. and other countries will continue to evolve, and may affect the manner in which the Firm structures its compensation programs and practices.\nOther significant international regulatory initiatives:  \n \nPolicymakers in the U.K. and EU continue to implement an extensive program of regulatory enhancements relating to financial services, several key elements of which are discussed below.\nU.K. and EU policymakers have recently proposed changes to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (\u201cMiFID II\u201d). MiFID II, which requires the trading of shares and certain standardized OTC derivatives to take place on trading venues and also significantly enhanced requirements for pre- and post-trade transparency, transaction reporting and investor protection, and introduced a position limits and reporting regime for commodities. In November 2021, the European Commission published a draft legislative proposal for amendments to MiFID II focused on changes to the transparency and market structure rules, including the proposed creation of a consolidated tape intended to provide investors with a holistic view of trading across the EU. This legislation is subject to review by the European Parliament and Council. \nIn the U.K., Her Majesty\u2019s Treasury (\u201cHMT\u201d) and the FCA have undertaken a review of MiFID II, as adopted in the U.K. In July 2021, HMT published its \u2018Wholesale Markets Review\u2019 consultation, which proposed a broad range of changes covering most parts of the MiFID II legislation. HMT is expected to release its related policy statement in the first quarter of 2022. Detailed consultations with specific rule proposals relating to the HMT policy statement are expected from the FCA during 2022.  \nIn November 2021, EU legislators agreed to delay implementation of the mandatory buy-in rules required under the Central Securities Depositories Regulation (\u201cCSDR\u201d), which were previously scheduled to become effective on February 1, 2022. In the interim, the European Securities and Markets Authority published a letter \n7\nPart I\ndirecting EU competent authorities to not prioritize supervisory action against firms under the CSDR. The U.K. previously announced in July 2020 that it would not be adopting the CSDR settlement discipline regime, which includes both the buy-in regime and the penalty regime.\nThe U.K. and EU have also proposed various reforms for the derivatives market, including proposed amendments to clearing obligations (\u201cCO\u201d) under the European Markets and Infrastructure Regulation and to derivatives trading obligations (\u201cDTO\u201d) under the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation, including issuing final rules to change the CO and DTO to reflect industry transition away from IBORs to risk-free reference rates. \nThe finalized Basel III capital and liquidity standards for banks and investment firms, including in relation to the leverage ratio, counterparty credit risk capital, large exposures and the net stable funding ratio, have been implemented through legislation that became effective in the EU in June 2021 and in the U.K. on January 1, 2022. The Firm\u2019s banking entities in the U.K. and EU will also be required to comply with certain changes made by the Basel Committee to the Basel III framework, including revisions to the credit risk and operational risk calculation methods, when they are implemented in those jurisdictions. EU legislation also requires that certain non-EU banks operating in the EU establish an intermediate parent undertaking (\u201cIPU\u201d) located in the EU. The IPU legislation allows a second IPU to be established if a single IPU would conflict with \u201chome country\u201d bank separation rules or impede resolvability. The Firm will be required to comply with the EU\u2019s IPU requirements, to the extent applicable, by December 30, 2023. \nThe Firm\u2019s banking entities in the U.K. and EU are subject to supervisory expectations published by the PRA and European Central Bank (\u201cECB\u201d), respectively, for management of financial risks arising from climate change. These supervisory expectations address bank strategy, governance, risk management, scenario analysis, risk reporting and disclosure. \n8", "item1a": ">Item 1A.

and the potential adverse effects of local economic, political, regulatory and social factors on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business and revenues in certain countries.\n\u2022\nPeople\n risks, including the criticality of attracting and retaining qualified and diverse employees; and the potential adverse effects of unfavorable changes in immigration or travel policies on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s workforce.\n\u2022\nLegal\n risks relating to litigation and regulatory and government investigations.\nThe above summary is subject in its entirety to the discussion of the risk factors set forth below.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nOngoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could harm the global economy and negatively affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a strain of novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, to be a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and governmental responses to the pandemic, which included the institution of social distancing and shelter-in-place requirements in certain areas of the U.S. and other countries, resulted in adverse impacts on global economic conditions, including:\n\u2022\nsignificant disruption and volatility in the financial markets\n\u2022\nsignificant disruption of global supply chains, and \n\u2022\nclosures of many businesses, leading to loss of revenues and increased unemployment.  \nThe adverse economic conditions caused by the pandemic have had a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses and results of operations, including:\n\u2022\nreduction in demand for certain products and services from JPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients and customers, resulting in lower revenue, and\n\u2022\nincreases in the allowance for credit losses during the early stages of the pandemic.\nAlthough global economic conditions have been improving despite the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic, any ongoing negative economic impacts arising from the pandemic or any prolongation or worsening of the pandemic, including as a result of additional waves or variants of the COVID-19 disease or the emergence of other diseases that have similar outcomes, could have significant adverse effects on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses, results of operations and financial condition, including:\n\u2022\nrecognition of charge-offs and increases in the allowance for credit losses, including any delayed recognition of charge-offs due to the impact of government stimulus actions or payment assistance provided to clients and customers\n\u2022\nmaterial impacts on the value of securities, derivatives and other financial instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets\n\u2022\ndowngrades in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit ratings\n\u2022\nconstraints on liquidity or capital due to elevated levels of deposits, increases in risk-weighted assets (\u201cRWA\u201d) related to supporting client activities, downgrades in client credit ratings, regulatory actions or other factors, any or all of which could require JPMorgan Chase to take or refrain from taking actions that it otherwise would under its liquidity and capital management strategies, and\n\u2022\nthe possibility that significant portions of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, shelter-in-place arrangements, government actions or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affects JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses, results of operations and financial condition, as well as its regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be fully predicted, including:\n\u2022\nthe ultimate scope and duration of the pandemic \n\u2022\nthe effectiveness and acceptance of vaccines, and their availability in certain regions\n\u2022\nactions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic, and\n\u2022\nthe effect that the pandemic or any prolongation or worsening of the pandemic may have on the pace of economic growth, inflation, the strength of labor markets, particularly in light of the expiration of government assistance programs, and the potential for changes in consumer \n10\nbehavior that could have longer-term impacts on certain economic sectors.\nIn addition, JPMorgan Chase's participation in U.S. government programs designed to support individuals, households and businesses impacted by the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, whether directly or indirectly, including on behalf of customers and clients or by affiliated entities, newly-acquired businesses or companies in which JPMorgan Chase has made principal investments, could be criticized and subject JPMorgan Chase to:\n\u2022\nincreased governmental and regulatory scrutiny\n\u2022\nnegative publicity, and \n\u2022\nincreased exposure to litigation,\n \nany or all of which could increase JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational, legal and compliance costs and damage its reputation. To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described below. \nRegulatory\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses are highly regulated, and the laws, rules and regulations that apply to JPMorgan Chase have a significant impact on its business and operations.\nJPMorgan Chase is a financial services firm with operations worldwide. JPMorgan Chase must comply with the laws, rules and regulations that apply to its operations in all of the jurisdictions around the world in which it does business. Regulation of the financial services industry is extensive.\nThe regulation and supervision of financial services firms has expanded significantly over an extended period of time. The increased regulation and supervision of JPMorgan Chase has affected the way that it conducts its business and structures its operations. JPMorgan Chase could be required to make further changes to its business and operations in response to expanded supervision or to new or changed laws, rules and regulations. These types of developments could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring additional costs in connection with complying with applicable laws, rules and regulations, which could reduce its profitability. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s entry into or acquisition of a new business or an increase in its principal investments may require JPMorgan Chase to comply with additional laws, rules, and regulations.\nIn response to new and existing laws, rules and regulations and expanded supervision, JPMorgan Chase has in the past been and could in the future be, required to:\n\u2022\nlimit the products and services that it offers\n\u2022\nreduce the liquidity that it can provide through its market-making activities\n\u2022\nrefrain from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue\n\u2022\npay higher taxes, assessments, levies or other governmental charges, including in connection with the resolution of tax examinations\n\u2022\nincur losses with respect to fraudulent transactions perpetrated against its customers\n\u2022\ndispose of certain assets, and do so at times or prices that are disadvantageous\n\u2022\nimpose restrictions on certain business activities, or\n\u2022\nincrease the prices that it charges for products and services, which could reduce the demand for them.\nIn particular, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in laws, rules and regulations, or changes in the application, interpretation or enforcement of laws, rules and regulations, that:\n\u2022\nproscribe or institute more stringent restrictions on certain financial services activities\n\u2022\nimpose new requirements relating to the impact of business activities on environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) concerns, the management of risks associated with those concerns and the offering of products intended to achieve ESG-related objectives, or\n\u2022\nintroduce changes to antitrust or anti-competition laws, rules and regulations that adversely affect the business activities of JPMorgan Chase.\n \nDifferences in financial services regulation can be disadvantageous for JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses.\nThe content and application of laws, rules and regulations affecting financial services firms sometimes vary according to factors such as the size of the firm, the jurisdiction in which it is organized or operates, and other criteria. For example:\n\u2022\nlarger firms such as JPMorgan Chase are often subject to more stringent supervision and regulation\n\u2022\nfinancial technology companies and other non-traditional competitors may not be subject to banking regulation, or may be supervised by a national or state regulatory agency that does not have the same resources or regulatory priorities as the regulatory agencies which supervise more diversified financial services firms, or \n\u2022\nthe financial services regulatory framework in a particular jurisdiction may favor financial institutions that are based in that jurisdiction.\nThese types of differences in the regulatory framework can result in JPMorgan Chase losing market share to competitors that are less regulated or not subject to regulation, especially with respect to unregulated financial products.\n11\nPart I\nThere can also be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the U.S. and in other countries and regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business. For example, when adopting rules that are intended to implement a global regulatory standard, a national regulator may introduce additional or more restrictive requirements, which can create competitive disadvantages for financial services firms, such as JPMorgan Chase, that may be subject to those enhanced regulations.\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives outside the U.S. could require JPMorgan Chase to make significant modifications to its operations and legal entity structure in the relevant countries or regions in order to comply with those requirements. These include laws, rules and regulations that have been adopted or proposed relating to:\n\u2022\nthe establishment of locally-based intermediate holding companies or operating subsidiaries\n\u2022\nrequirements to maintain minimum amounts of capital or liquidity in locally-based subsidiaries\n\u2022\nthe separation (or \u201cring fencing\u201d) of core banking products and services from markets activities\n\u2022\nthe resolution of financial institutions\n\u2022\nrequirements for executing or settling transactions on exchanges or through central counterparties (\u201cCCPs\u201d)\n\u2022\nposition limits and reporting rules for derivatives\n\u2022\ngovernance and accountability regimes\n\u2022\nconduct of business and control requirements, and\n\u2022\nrestrictions on compensation.\nThese types of differences, inconsistencies and conflicts in financial services regulation have required and could in the future require JPMorgan Chase to:\n\u2022\ndivest assets or restructure its operations\n\u2022\nabsorb increased operational, capital and liquidity costs \n\u2022\nchange the prices that it charges for its products and services \n\u2022\ncurtail the products and services that it offers to its customers and clients\n\u2022\ncurtail other business opportunities, including acquisitions or principal investments, that it otherwise would have pursued, or \n\u2022\nincur higher costs for complying with different legal and regulatory frameworks. \nAny or all of these factors could harm JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to compete against other firms that are not subject to the same laws, rules and regulations or supervisory oversight, or harm JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses, results of operations and profitability.\nResolving regulatory investigations can subject JPMorgan Chase to significant penalties and collateral consequences, and could result in higher compliance costs or restrictions on its operations.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations are subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many jurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase has paid significant fines, provided other monetary relief, incurred other penalties and experienced other repercussions in connection with resolving investigations and enforcement actions by governmental agencies. JPMorgan Chase could become subject to similar regulatory resolutions or other actions in the future, and addressing the requirements of any such resolutions or actions could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring higher operational and compliance costs, including devoting substantial resources to the required remediation, or needing to comply with other restrictions. \nIn connection with resolving specific regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, certain regulators have required JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions to admit wrongdoing with respect to the activities that gave rise to the resolution. These types of admissions can lead to:\n\u2022\ngreater exposure in litigation\n\u2022\ndamage to reputation\n\u2022\ndisqualification from doing business with certain clients or customers, or in specific jurisdictions, or\n\u2022\nother direct and indirect adverse effects.\nFurthermore, U.S. government officials have demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions and have required that institutions plead guilty to criminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in connection with resolving regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. Resolutions of this type can have significant collateral consequences for the subject financial institution, including:\n\u2022\nloss of clients, customers and business\n\u2022\nrestrictions on offering certain products or services, and \n\u2022\nlosing permission to operate certain businesses, either temporarily or permanently.\nJPMorgan Chase expects that: \n\u2022\nit and other financial services firms will continue to be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions\n\u2022\nregulators will continue to require that financial institutions be penalized for actual or deemed violations of law with formal and punitive enforcement actions, including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions, rather than resolving these matters through informal supervisory actions; and  \n12\n\u2022\nregulators will be more likely to pursue formal enforcement actions and resolutions against JPMorgan Chase to the extent that it has previously been subject to other governmental investigations or enforcement actions.\nIf JPMorgan Chase fails to meet the requirements of any resolution of a governmental investigation or enforcement action, or to maintain risk and control processes that meet the heightened standards and expectations of its regulators, it could be required to, among other things:\n\u2022\nenter into further resolutions of investigations or enforcement actions\n\u2022\npay additional regulatory penalties or enter into judgments, or\n\u2022\naccept material regulatory restrictions on, or changes in the management of, its businesses.\nIn these circumstances, JPMorgan Chase could also become subject to other sanctions, or to prosecution or civil litigation with respect to the conduct that gave rise to an investigation or enforcement action.\nJPMorgan Chase can face greater risks of non-compliance and incur higher operational and compliance costs under laws, rules and regulations relating to anti-money laundering, economic sanctions, embargo programs and anti-corruption.\nJPMorgan Chase must comply with laws, rules and regulations throughout the world relating to anti-money laundering, economic sanctions, embargo programs and anti-corruption which can increase its risks of non-compliance and costs associated with the implementation and maintenance of complex compliance programs. A violation of any of these legal and regulatory requirements could subject JPMorgan Chase, or individual employees, to regulatory enforcement actions as well as significant civil and criminal penalties. In addition, certain national and multi-national bodies and governmental agencies outside the U.S. have adopted laws, rules or regulations that conflict with or prohibit a firm such as JPMorgan Chase from complying with laws, rules and regulations to which it is otherwise subject, creating conflict of law issues that also increase its risks of non-compliance in those jurisdictions.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations and financial results can be negatively impacted in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks\n.\nJPMorgan Chase conducts existing and new business in certain countries in which the application of the rule of law is inconsistent or less predictable, including with respect to:\n\u2022\nthe absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions\n\u2022\nconflicting or ambiguous laws, rules and regulations, or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws, rules and regulations\n\u2022\nuncertainty concerning the enforceability of contractual, intellectual property or other obligations\n\u2022\ndifficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses, or where graft or corruption may be pervasive, and \n\u2022\nthe threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations, civil litigations or criminal prosecutions, the termination of licenses required to operate in the local market or the suspension of business relationships with governmental bodies.\nIf the application of the laws, rules and regulations in a particular country is susceptible to producing inconsistent or unexpected outcomes, this can create a more difficult environment in which JPMorgan Chase conducts its business and could negatively affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations and reduce its earnings with respect to that country. For example, conducting business could require JPMorgan Chase to devote significant additional resources to understanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws, rules and regulations, as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws, rules and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures.\nThere can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase will always be successful in its efforts to fully understand and to conduct its business in compliance with the laws, rules and regulations of all of the jurisdictions in which it operates, and the risk of non-compliance can be greater in countries that have less predictable legal and regulatory systems.\nRequirements for the orderly resolution of JPMorgan Chase could result in JPMorgan Chase having to restructure or reorganize its businesses and could increase its funding or operational costs or curtail its businesses.\nJPMorgan Chase is required under Federal Reserve and FDIC rules to prepare and submit periodically to those agencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy, without extraordinary government support, in the event of material financial distress or failure. The agencies\u2019 evaluation of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s resolution plan may change, and the requirements for resolution plans may be modified from time to time. Any such determinations or modifications could result in JPMorgan Chase needing to make changes to its legal entity structure or to certain internal or external activities, which could increase its funding or operational costs, or hamper its ability to serve clients and customers.\nIf the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were both to determine that a resolution plan submitted by JPMorgan Chase has deficiencies, they could jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s growth, activities or operations.\u00a0The agencies could also require that JPMorgan Chase restructure, reorganize or divest assets or businesses in \n13\nPart I\nways that could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations and strategy. \nHolders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s debt and equity securities will absorb losses if it were to enter into a resolution.\nFederal Reserve rules require that JPMorgan Chase & Co. (the \u201cParent Company\u201d) maintain minimum levels of unsecured external long-term debt and other loss-absorbing capacity with specific terms (\u201celigible LTD\u201d) for purposes of recapitalizing JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operating subsidiaries if the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution either: \n\u2022\nin a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or  \n\u2022\nin a receivership administered by the FDIC under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act (\u201cTitle II\u201d).  \nIf the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution, holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the Parent Company will absorb the losses of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries. \nThe preferred \u201csingle point of entry\u201d strategy under JPMorgan Chase\u2019s resolution plan contemplates that only the Parent Company would enter bankruptcy proceedings.\u00a0JPMorgan Chase\u2019s subsidiaries would be recapitalized, as needed, so that they could continue normal operations or subsequently be divested or wound down in an orderly manner. As a result, the Parent Company\u2019s losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of the Parent Company\u2019s equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured creditors, including holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities. Claims of holders of those securities would have a junior position to the claims of creditors of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s subsidiaries and to the claims of priority (as determined by statute) and secured creditors of the Parent Company.   \nAccordingly, in a resolution of the Parent Company in bankruptcy, holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities of the Parent Company would realize value only to the extent available to the Parent Company as a shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its other subsidiaries, and only after any claims of priority and secured creditors of the Parent Company have been fully repaid. \nThe FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point of entry recapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a systemically important financial institution, such as the Parent Company, under Title II. However, the FDIC has not formally adopted a single point of entry resolution strategy. \nIf the Parent Company were to approach, or enter into, a resolution, none of the Parent Company, the Federal Reserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow JPMorgan Chase\u2019s preferred resolution strategy, and losses to holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the \nParent Company, under whatever strategy is ultimately followed, could be greater than they might have been under JPMorgan Chase\u2019s preferred strategy.  \nPolitical\nEconomic uncertainty or instability caused by political developments can negatively impact JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses.\nPolitical developments in the U.S. and other countries can cause uncertainty in the economic environment and market conditions in which JPMorgan Chase operates its businesses. Certain monetary, fiscal and other policy initiatives and proposals could significantly affect U.S. and global economic growth and cause higher volatility in the financial markets, including:\n\u2022\nmonetary policies and actions taken by the Federal Reserve and other central banks or governmental authorities, including any sustained large-scale asset purchases or any suspension or reversal of those actions\n\u2022\nfiscal policies, including with respect to taxation and spending\n\u2022\nactions that governments take or fail to take in response to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the effectiveness of any actions taken\n\u2022\nisolationist foreign policies\n\u2022\nan outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other geopolitical instabilities\n\u2022\neconomic sanctions\n\u2022\nthe implementation of tariffs and other protectionist trade policies, or\n\u2022\nother governmental policies or actions adopted or taken in response to political or social pressures.\nThese types of political developments, and uncertainty about the possible outcomes of these developments, could:\n\u2022\nerode investor confidence in the U.S. economy and financial markets, which could potentially undermine the status of the U.S. dollar as a safe haven currency \n\u2022\nprovoke retaliatory countermeasures by other countries and otherwise heighten tensions in diplomatic relations \n\u2022\nlead to the withdrawal of government support for agencies and enterprises such as the U.S. Federal National Mortgage Association and the U.S. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (together, the \u201cU.S. GSEs\u201d)\n\u2022\nincrease concerns about whether the U.S. government will be funded, and its outstanding debt serviced, at any particular time\n\u2022\nresult in periodic shutdowns of the U.S. government or governments in other countries \n14\n\u2022\nincrease investor reliance on actions by the Federal Reserve or other central banks, or influence investor perceptions concerning government support of sectors of the economy or the economy as a whole\n\u2022\nadversely affect the financial condition or credit ratings of clients and counterparties with which JPMorgan Chase does business, or\n\u2022\ncause JPMorgan Chase to refrain from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue.\nThese factors could lead to:\n\u2022\nslower growth rates, rising inflation or recession\n\u2022\ngreater market volatility\n\u2022\na contraction of available credit and the widening of credit spreads \n\u2022\nerosion of adequate risk premium on certain financial assets \n\u2022\ndiminished investor and consumer confidence\n\u2022\nlower investment growth\n\u2022\nlarge-scale sales of government debt and other debt and equity securities in the U.S. and other countries\n\u2022\nreduced commercial activity among trading partners\n\u2022\nthe potential for a currency redenomination by a particular country\n\u2022\nthe possible departure of a country from, or the dissolution of, a political or economic alliance or treaty\n\u2022\npotential expropriation or nationalization of assets, or \n\u2022\nother market dislocations, including the spread of unfavorable economic conditions from a particular country or region to other countries or regions.\nAny of these potential outcomes could cause JPMorgan Chase to suffer losses on its market-making positions or in its investment portfolio, reduce its liquidity and capital levels, increase credit risk, hamper its ability to deliver products and services to its clients and customers, and weaken its results of operations and financial condition.\nMarket\nEconomic and market events and conditions can materially affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses and investment and market-making positions.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s results of operations can be negatively affected by adverse changes in any of the following:\n\u2022\ninvestor, consumer and business sentiment\n\u2022\nevents that reduce confidence in the financial markets\n\u2022\ninflation or deflation\n\u2022\nhigh unemployment or, conversely, a tightening labor market\n\u2022\nthe availability and cost of capital, liquidity and credit\n\u2022\nlevels and volatility of interest rates, credit spreads and market prices for currencies, equities and commodities, and the duration of any changes in levels or volatility\n\u2022\nthe economic effects of an outbreak or escalation of hostilities, terrorism or other geopolitical instabilities, cyber attacks, climate change, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics or other extraordinary events beyond JPMorgan Chase\u2019s control, and\n\u2022\nthe health of the U.S. and global economies.\nAll of these are affected by global economic, market and political events and conditions, as well as regulatory restrictions.\nIn addition, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s investment portfolio and market-making businesses can suffer losses due to unanticipated market events, including:\n\u2022\nsevere declines in asset values\n\u2022\nunexpected credit events\n\u2022\nunforeseen events or conditions that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa)\n\u2022\nthe inability to effectively hedge market and other risks related to market-making and investment portfolio positions, or\n\u2022\nother market risks that may not have been appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a financial instrument.\nIf JPMorgan Chase experiences significant losses in its investment portfolio or from market-making activities, this could reduce JPMorgan Chase\u2019s profitability and its liquidity and capital levels, and thereby constrain the growth of its businesses.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer businesses can be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions and governmental policies.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer businesses are particularly affected by U.S. and global economic conditions, including:\n\u2022\npersonal and household income distribution\n\u2022\nunemployment or underemployment\n\u2022\nprolonged periods of exceptionally low interest rates\n\u2022\nhousing prices\n\u2022\nthe level of inflation and its effect on prices for goods and services\n\u2022\nconsumer and small business confidence levels, and\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer spending or in the level of consumer debt.\n15\nPart I\nHeightened levels of unemployment or underemployment that result in reduced personal and household income could negatively affect consumer credit performance to the extent that consumers are less able to service their debts. In addition, sustained low growth, low or negative interest rates, inflationary pressures or recessionary conditions could diminish customer demand for the products and services offered by JPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer businesses. \nAdverse economic conditions could also lead to an increase in delinquencies, additions to the allowance for credit losses and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce JPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings. These consequences could be significantly worse in certain geographies and industry segments where declining industrial or manufacturing activity has resulted in or could result in higher levels of unemployment, or where high levels of consumer debt, such as outstanding student loans, could impair the ability of customers to pay their other consumer loan obligations.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings from its consumer businesses could also be adversely affected by governmental policies and actions that affect consumers, including:\n\u2022\npolicies and initiatives relating to medical insurance, education, immigration, employment status and housing, and\n\u2022\npolicies aimed at the economy more broadly, such as higher taxes and increased regulation which could result in reductions in consumer disposable income.\nIn addition, governmental proposals to permit student loan obligations to be discharged in bankruptcy proceedings could, if enacted into law, encourage certain of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s customers to declare personal bankruptcy and thereby trigger defaults and charge-offs of credit card and other consumer loans extended to those customers. \nUnfavorable market and economic conditions can have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s wholesale businesses.\nIn JPMorgan Chase\u2019s wholesale businesses, market and economic factors can affect the volume of transactions that JPMorgan Chase executes for its clients or for which it advises clients, and, therefore, the revenue that JPMorgan Chase receives from those transactions. These factors can also influence the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in capital markets transactions that JPMorgan Chase manages, such as loan syndications or securities underwritings. Furthermore, if a significant and sustained deterioration in market conditions were to occur, the profitability of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s capital markets businesses, including its loan syndication, securities underwriting and leveraged lending activities, could be reduced to the extent that those businesses:\n\u2022\nearn less fee revenue due to lower transaction volumes, including when clients are unwilling or unable to refinance their outstanding debt obligations in unfavorable market conditions, or\n\u2022\ndispose of portions of credit commitments at a loss, or hold larger residual positions in credit commitments that cannot be sold at favorable prices.\nAn adverse change in market conditions in particular segments of the economy, such as a sudden and severe downturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in commodity prices, or sustained changes in consumer behavior that affect specific economic sectors, could have a material adverse effect on clients of JPMorgan Chase whose operations or financial condition are directly or indirectly dependent on the health or stability of those market segments or economic sectors, as well as clients that are engaged in related businesses. JPMorgan Chase could incur losses on its loans and other credit commitments to clients that operate in, or are dependent on, any sector of the economy that is under stress.\nThe fees that JPMorgan Chase earns from managing client assets or holding assets under custody for clients could be diminished by declining asset values or other adverse macroeconomic conditions. For example, higher interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuations of client assets that JPMorgan Chase manages or holds under custody, which, in turn, could affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s revenue from fees that are based on the amount of assets under management or custody. Similarly, adverse macroeconomic or market conditions could prompt outflows from JPMorgan Chase funds or accounts, or cause clients to invest in products that generate lower revenue. Substantial and unexpected withdrawals from a JPMorgan Chase fund can also hamper the investment performance of the fund, particularly if the outflows create the need for the fund to dispose of fund assets at disadvantageous times or prices, and could lead to further withdrawals based on the weaker investment performance.\nAn economic downturn or sustained changes in consumer behavior that results in shifts in consumer and business spending could also have a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s wholesale clients, and thereby diminish JPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings from its wholesale operations. For example, the businesses of certain of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s wholesale clients are dependent on consistent streams of rental income from commercial real estate properties which are owned or being built by those clients. Sustained adverse economic conditions could result in reductions in the rental cash flows that owners or developers receive from their tenants which, in turn, could depress the values of the properties and impair the ability of borrowers to service or refinance their commercial real estate loans. These consequences could result in JPMorgan Chase experiencing increases in the allowance for credit losses, higher delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs within its commercial real estate loan portfolio and incurring higher costs for servicing a larger volume of delinquent loans in that portfolio, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings from its wholesale businesses.\n16\nChanges in interest rates and credit spreads can adversely affect certain of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s revenue and income streams related to its traditional banking and funding activities. \nIn general, a low or negative interest rate environment may cause:\n\u2022\nnet interest margins to be compressed, which could reduce the amounts that JPMorgan Chase earns on its investment securities portfolio to the extent that it is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-yielding instruments\n\u2022\nunanticipated or adverse changes in depositor behavior, which could negatively affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s broader asset and liability management strategy\n\u2022\nJPMorgan Chase to reduce the amount of deposits that it accepts from customers and clients, which could result in lower revenues, and\n\u2022\na reduction in the value of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s mortgage servicing rights (\u201cMSRs\u201d) asset, thereby decreasing revenues.\nWhen credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensive for JPMorgan Chase to borrow. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit spreads may widen or narrow not only in response to events and circumstances that are specific to JPMorgan Chase but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions. Changes in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit spreads will affect, positively or negatively, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings on certain liabilities, such as derivatives, that are recorded at fair value. \nWhen interest rates are increasing, JPMorgan Chase can generally be expected to earn higher net interest income. However, higher interest rates can also lead to:\n\u2022\nfewer originations of commercial and residential real estate loans\n\u2022\nlosses on underwriting exposures\n\u2022\nthe loss of deposits, including in the event that JPMorgan Chase makes incorrect assumptions about depositor behavior\n\u2022\nunrealized mark-to-market losses on available-for-sale (\u201cAFS\u201d) securities held in the investment securities portfolio\n\u2022\nlower net interest income if central banks introduce interest rate increases more quickly than anticipated and this results in a misalignment in the pricing of short-term and long-term borrowings\n\u2022\nless liquidity in the financial markets, and\n\u2022\nhigher funding costs.\nAll of these outcomes could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings or its liquidity and capital levels. Higher interest rates can also negatively affect the payment \nperformance on loans within JPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to variable interest rates. If borrowers of variable rate loans are unable to afford higher interest payments, those borrowers may reduce or stop making payments, thereby causing JPMorgan Chase to incur losses and increased operational costs related to servicing a higher volume of delinquent loans. \nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s results may be materially affected by market fluctuations and significant changes in the value of financial instruments.\nThe value of securities, derivatives and other financial instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets can be materially affected by market fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid market conditions and other disruptions in the financial markets may make it extremely difficult to value certain financial instruments. Subsequent valuations of financial instruments in future periods, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the value of these instruments. In addition, at the time of any disposition of these financial instruments, the price that JPMorgan Chase ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value. Any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of financial instruments that JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets, which may have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s results of operations.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s risk management and monitoring processes, including its stress testing framework, seek to quantify and control JPMorgan Chase\u2019s exposure to more extreme market moves. However, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s hedging and other risk management strategies may not be effective, and it could incur significant losses, if extreme market events were to occur.\nCredit\nJPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected by adverse changes in the financial condition of clients, counterparties, custodians and CCPs.\nJPMorgan Chase routinely executes transactions with clients and counterparties such as corporations, financial institutions, asset managers, hedge funds, securities exchanges and government entities within and outside the U.S. Many of these transactions expose JPMorgan Chase to the credit risk of its clients and counterparties, and can involve JPMorgan Chase in disputes and litigation if a client or counterparty defaults. JPMorgan Chase can also be subject to losses or liability where a financial institution that it has appointed to provide custodial services for client assets or funds becomes insolvent as a result of fraud or the failure to abide by existing laws and obligations.\nA default by, or the financial or operational failure of, a CCP through which JPMorgan Chase executes contracts would require JPMorgan Chase to replace those contracts, thereby \n17\nPart I\nincreasing its operational costs and potentially resulting in losses. In addition, JPMorgan Chase can be exposed to losses if a member of a CCP in which JPMorgan Chase is also a member defaults on its obligations to the CCP because of requirements that each member of the CCP absorb a portion of those losses. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase can be subject to bearing its share of non-default losses incurred by a CCP, including losses from custodial, settlement or investment activities or due to cyber or other security breaches.\nAs part of its clearing services activities, JPMorgan Chase is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, which it seeks to mitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate collateral. JPMorgan Chase is also exposed to intra-day credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash management, clearing, custodial and other transaction services to those clients. If a client for which JPMorgan Chase provides these services becomes bankrupt or insolvent, JPMorgan Chase may incur losses, become involved in disputes and litigation with one or more CCPs, the client\u2019s bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or be subject to regulatory investigations. All of the foregoing events can increase JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational and litigation costs, and JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses to the extent that any collateral that it has received is insufficient to cover those losses.\nTransactions with government entities, including national, state, provincial, municipal and local authorities, can expose JPMorgan Chase to enhanced sovereign, credit, operational and reputation risks. Government entities may, among other things, claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials or repudiate transactions authorized by a previous incumbent government. These types of actions have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, JPMorgan Chase to suffer losses or hamper its ability to conduct business in the relevant jurisdiction.\nIn addition, local laws, rules and regulations could limit JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to resolve disputes and litigation in the event of a counterparty default or unwillingness to make previously agreed-upon payments, which could subject JPMorgan Chase to losses.\nDisputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives contracts with regard to the terms, the settlement procedures or the value of underlying collateral. The disposition of those disputes could cause JPMorgan Chase to incur unexpected transaction, operational and legal costs, or result in credit losses. These consequences can also impair JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to effectively manage its credit risk exposure from its market activities, or cause harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\nThe financial or operational failure of a significant market participant, such as a major financial institution or a CCP, or concerns about the creditworthiness of such a market participant, can have a cascading effect within the financial markets. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses could be \nsignificantly disrupted by such an event, particularly if it leads to other market participants incurring significant losses, experiencing liquidity issues or defaulting, and JPMorgan Chase is likely to have significant interrelationships with, and credit exposure to, such a significant market participant.\nJPMorgan Chase may suffer losses if the value of collateral declines in stressed market conditions.\nDuring periods of market stress or illiquidity, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit risk may be further increased when:\n\u2022\nJPMorgan Chase fails to realize the fair value of the collateral it holds\n\u2022\ncollateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount owed to it, or\n\u2022\ncounterparties are unable to post collateral, whether for operational or other reasons.\nFurthermore, disputes with counterparties concerning the valuation of collateral may increase in times of significant market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and JPMorgan Chase could suffer losses during these periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or to manage declines in the value of collateral.\nJPMorgan Chase could incur significant losses arising from concentrations of credit and market risk.\nJPMorgan Chase is exposed to greater credit and market risk to the extent that groupings of its clients or counterparties:\n\u2022\nengage in similar or related businesses, or in businesses in related industries\n\u2022\ndo business in the same geographic region, or\n\u2022\nhave business profiles, models or strategies that could cause their ability to meet their obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. \nFor example, a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s borrowers or counterparties could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other borrowers or counterparties in similar, related or dependent industries. This type of interrelationship could exacerbate JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit, liquidity and market risk exposure and potentially cause it to incur losses, including fair value losses in its market-making businesses and investment portfolios. In addition, JPMorgan Chase may be required to increase the allowance for credit losses with respect to certain clients or industries in order to align with directives or expectations of its banking regulators. \nSimilarly, challenging economic conditions that affect a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s borrowers or counterparties not only in that particular industry or geography but in related or dependent industries, wherever located. These conditions could also heighten concerns about the ability of customers of \n18\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer businesses who live in those areas or work in those affected industries or related or dependent industries to meet their obligations to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit and market risk exposures to assess the potential risks of concentration or contagion, but its efforts to diversify or hedge its exposures against those risks may not be successful.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer businesses can also be harmed by an excessive expansion of consumer credit by bank or non-bank competitors. Heightened competition for certain types of consumer loans could prompt industry-wide reactions such as significant reductions in the pricing or margins of those loans or the making of loans to less-creditworthy borrowers. If large numbers of consumers subsequently default on their loans, whether due to weak credit profiles, an economic downturn or other factors, this could impair their ability to repay obligations owed to JPMorgan Chase and result in higher charge-offs and other credit-related losses. More broadly, widespread defaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary conditions in the U.S. economy, and JPMorgan Chase\u2019s consumer businesses may earn lower revenues in such an environment.\nIf JPMorgan Chase is unable to reduce positions effectively during a market dislocation, this can increase both the market and credit risks associated with those positions and the level of RWA that JPMorgan Chase holds on its balance sheet. These factors could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s capital position, funding costs and the profitability of its businesses.\nLiquidity\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to operate its businesses could be impaired if its liquidity is constrained. \nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s liquidity could be impaired at any given time by factors such as:\n\u2022\nmarket-wide illiquidity or disruption\n\u2022\nunforeseen liquidity or capital requirements, including as a result of changes in laws, rules and regulations\n\u2022\ninability to sell assets, or to sell assets at favorable times or prices\n\u2022\ndefault by a CCP or other significant market participant\n\u2022\nunanticipated outflows of cash or collateral\n\u2022\nunexpected loss of consumer deposits or higher than anticipated draws on lending-related commitments, and\n\u2022\nlack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan Chase or financial institutions in general. \nA reduction in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s liquidity may be caused by events over which it has little or no control. For example, during periods of market stress, low investor confidence and significant market illiquidity could result in higher \nfunding costs for JPMorgan Chase and could limit its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity. \nJPMorgan Chase may need to raise funding from alternative sources if its access to stable and lower-cost sources of funding, such as deposits and borrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks, is reduced. Alternative sources of funding could be more expensive or limited in availability. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s funding costs could also be negatively affected by actions that JPMorgan Chase may take in order to:\n\u2022\nsatisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements\n\u2022\naddress obligations under its resolution plan, or\n\u2022\nsatisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions outside the U.S. relating to the pre-positioning of liquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal entities.\nMore generally, if JPMorgan Chase fails to effectively manage its liquidity, this could constrain its ability to fund or invest in its businesses and subsidiaries, and thereby adversely affect its results of operations.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company and depends on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to make payments on its outstanding securities.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company that holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and an intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the \u201cIHC\u201d).\u00a0The IHC in turn generally holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and provides intercompany lending to the holding company. \nThe holding company is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock).\nThe ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC to make payments to the holding company is also limited.\u00a0JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to regulatory restrictions on its dividend distributions, as well as capital adequacy requirements, such as the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (\u201cSLR\u201d), and liquidity requirements and other regulatory restrictions on its ability to make payments to the holding company. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the holding company if certain capital or liquidity thresholds are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by JPMorgan Chase\u2019s management or Board of Directors. \nAs a result of these arrangements, the ability of the holding company to make various payments is dependent on its receiving dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and borrowings from the IHC. These limitations could affect the holding company\u2019s ability to:\n\u2022\npay interest on its debt securities\n19\nPart I\n\u2022\npay dividends on its equity securities\n\u2022\nredeem or repurchase outstanding securities, and\n\u2022\nfulfill its other payment obligations.\nThese arrangements could also result in the holding company seeking protection under bankruptcy laws or otherwise entering into resolution proceedings at a time earlier than would have been the case absent the existence of the capital and liquidity thresholds to which the IHC is subject.\nReductions in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its principal subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies. Rating agencies evaluate both general and firm-specific and industry-specific factors when determining credit ratings for a particular financial institution, including:\n\u2022\nexpected future profitability \n\u2022\nrisk management practices\n\u2022\nlegal expenses\n\u2022\nratings differentials between bank holding companies and their bank and non-bank subsidiaries\n\u2022\nregulatory developments \n\u2022\nassumptions about government support, and \n\u2022\neconomic and geopolitical developments. \nJPMorgan Chase closely monitors and manages, to the extent that it is able, factors that could influence its credit ratings.\u00a0However, there is no assurance that JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit ratings will not be lowered in the future.\u00a0Furthermore, any such downgrade could occur at times of broader market instability when JPMorgan Chase\u2019s options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low.\nA reduction in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s credit ratings could curtail JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business activities and reduce its profitability in a number of ways, including:\n\u2022\nreducing its access to capital markets \n\u2022\nmaterially increasing its cost of issuing and servicing securities \n\u2022\ntriggering additional collateral or funding requirements, and \n\u2022\ndecreasing the number of investors and counterparties that are willing or permitted to do business with or lend to JPMorgan Chase.\nAny rating reduction could also increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries.\u00a0This could, in turn, adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries.\nThe reform and replacement of benchmark rates could adversely affect financial instruments issued, funded, serviced or held by JPMorgan Chase and expose it to litigation and other disputes. \nInterest rate, equity, foreign exchange rate and other types of indices which are deemed to be \u201cbenchmarks,\u201d including those in widespread and longstanding use, have been the subject of ongoing international, national and other regulatory scrutiny and initiatives for reform, including:\n\u2022\nchanges to the rules and methodologies under which certain benchmarks are administered\n\u2022\ninitiatives designed to discourage or prohibit the use of certain benchmarks by market participants\n\u2022\nthe introduction of alternative reference rates to be used by market participants in lieu of certain benchmarks, and\n\u2022\nlegislative proposals and actions providing for the replacement of reference rates under existing contracts and instruments that are linked to certain benchmarks with alternative reference rates\n.\nSome of these reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented or are under consideration. These and other reforms relating to benchmarks could: \n\u2022\ncause certain benchmarks to be substantially modified or to be permanently discontinued \n\u2022\nlead to disruptions in the financial markets, including in connection with the transition to alternative reference rates\n\u2022\ngive rise to litigation and other disputes\n\u2022\ncause reputational harm to the extent that operational and technology systems are not sufficiently prepared for the transition to alternative reference rates, or \n\u2022\nhave other consequences which cannot be fully anticipated.\nAny of these developments, and any future initiatives to regulate, reform or change the administration of benchmarks, could result in adverse consequences to the return on, value of and market for loans, mortgages, securities, derivatives and other financial instruments whose returns are linked to any such benchmark, including those issued, funded, serviced or held by JPMorgan Chase.\nChanges in the manner in which certain benchmarks are administered, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of those benchmarks, could increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of those benchmarks and complying with regulations or requirements relating to those benchmarks. Such factors may have the effect of discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to certain benchmarks, trigger further changes in the rules or methodologies under which certain benchmarks are \n20\nadministered or lead to the discontinuation of certain benchmarks.\nRegulators, industry bodies and other market participants in the U.S. and other countries continue to engage in initiatives to develop, introduce and encourage the use of alternative reference rates to replace certain benchmarks, and certain of these alternative rates have gained or are gaining acceptance among market participants. However, there is no assurance that: \n\u2022\nany of these new rates will be similar to, or produce the economic equivalent of, the benchmarks that they seek to replace\n\u2022\narrangements by market participants to prepare for the discontinuation of certain benchmarks and the transition to alternative reference rates will be fully effective, or\n\u2022\na particular alternative reference rate will be widely accepted by market participants, or that market acceptance of that rate will not be hindered by the introduction of other reference rates.\n \nIf a particular benchmark were to be discontinued and an alternative reference rate has not been successfully introduced or widely accepted within the market, this could result in significant adverse effects on the financial markets. For example, vast amounts of loans, mortgages, securities, derivatives and other financial instruments are linked to the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) benchmark. ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, has announced that the publication of the principal tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR will cease after June 30, 2023, and significant progress has been made by regulators, industry bodies and market participants to introduce and implement the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as a replacement rate for U.S. dollar LIBOR. However, if an alternative reference rate such as SOFR has not achieved sufficient market acceptance when the publication of the principal tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR is discontinued, or if market participants have not otherwise implemented effective transitional arrangements to address that discontinuation, this could result in widespread dislocation in the financial markets, volatility in the pricing of securities, derivatives and other instruments, and the suppression of capital markets activities, all of which could have a negative impact on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s results of operations and on U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked securities, credit or other instruments which are issued, funded, serviced or held by JPMorgan Chase. \nJPMorgan Chase could also become involved in litigation and other types of disputes with clients, customers, counterparties and investors as a consequence of the transition from U.S. dollar LIBOR and other benchmark rates to replacement rates, including claims that JPMorgan Chase has: \n\u2022\ntreated clients, customers, counterparties or investors unfairly, or caused them to experience losses, higher financing costs or lower returns on investments\n\u2022\nfailed to appropriately communicate the effects of the transition from benchmark rates on the products that JPMorgan Chase has sold to its clients and customers,   or failed to disclose purported conflicts of interest\n\u2022\nmade inappropriate product recommendations to or investments on behalf of its clients, or sold products that did not serve their intended purpose, in connection with the transition from benchmark rates\n\u2022\nengaged in anti-competitive behavior, or in the manipulation of markets or specific benchmarks, in connection with the discontinuation of or transition from benchmark rates, or\n\u2022\ndisadvantaged clients, customers, counterparties or investors when interpreting or making determinations under the terms of agreements or financial instruments.\nThese types of claims could subject JPMorgan Chase to higher legal expenses and operational costs, require it to pay significant amounts in connection with resolving litigation and other disputes, and harm its reputation.\nCapital\nMaintaining the required level and composition of capital may impact JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to support business activities, meet evolving regulatory requirements and distribute capital to shareholders.\nJPMorgan Chase is subject to various regulatory capital requirements, including leverage- and risk-based capital requirements. In addition, as a Globally Systemically Important Bank (\u201cGSIB\u201d), JPMorgan Chase is required to hold additional capital buffers, including a GSIB surcharge, a SCB, and a countercyclical buffer, each of which is reassessed at least annually. The amount of capital that JPMorgan Chase is required to hold in order to satisfy these leverage-and risk-based requirements could increase at any given time due to factors such as:\n\u2022\nactions by banking regulators, including changes in laws, rules, and regulations\n\u2022\nactions taken by the Federal Reserve or the U.S. government in response to the economic effects of systemic events, such as the actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which led to an expansion of the Federal Reserve balance sheet, growth in deposits held by JPMorgan Chase and other U.S. financial institutions and, consequently, an increase in leverage exposure and the GSIB surcharge\n\u2022\nchanges in the composition of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s balance sheet or developments that could increase risk weighted assets such as increased market risk, customer delinquencies, client credit rating downgrades or other factors, and\n21\nPart I\n\u2022\nincreases in estimated stress losses as determined by the Federal Reserve under the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, which could increase JPMorgan Chase\u2019s SCB.\nAny failure by or inability of JPMorgan Chase to maintain the required level and composition of capital, or unfavorable changes in applicable capital requirements, could have an adverse impact on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s shareholders, such as:\n\u2022\nreducing the amount of common stock that JPMorgan Chase is permitted to repurchase\n\u2022\nrequiring the issuance of, or prohibiting the redemption of, capital instruments in a manner inconsistent with JPMorgan Chase\u2019s capital management strategy\n\u2022\nconstraining the amount of dividends that may be paid on common stock, or\n\u2022\ncurtailing JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business activities or operations.\nOperational\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses are dependent on the effectiveness of its operational systems and those of other market participants.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses rely on the ability of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s financial, accounting, transaction execution, data processing and other operational systems to process, record, monitor and report a large number of transactions on a continuous basis, and to do so accurately, quickly and securely. In addition to proper design, installation, maintenance and training, the effective functioning of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational systems depends on:\n\u2022\nthe quality of the information contained in those systems, as inaccurate, outdated or corrupted data can significantly compromise the functionality or reliability of a particular system and other systems to which it transmits or from which it receives information, and\n\u2022\nthe ability of JPMorgan Chase to appropriately maintain and upgrade its systems on a regular basis, and to ensure that any changes introduced to its systems are managed carefully to ensure security and operational continuity and adhere to all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\nJPMorgan Chase also depends on its ability to access and use the operational systems of its vendors, custodians and other market participants, including clearing and payment systems, CCPs, securities exchanges and data processing, security and technology companies (including those that provide cloud computing services). \nThe ineffectiveness, failure or other disruption of operational systems upon which JPMorgan Chase depends, including due to a systems malfunction, cyberbreach or other systems failure, could result in unfavorable ripple \neffects in the financial markets and for JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers, including:\n\u2022\ndelays or other disruptions in providing services, liquidity or information to clients and customers\n\u2022\nthe inability to settle transactions or obtain access to funds and other assets, including those for which physical settlement and delivery is required\n\u2022\nfailure to timely settle or confirm transactions\n\u2022\nthe possibility that funds transfers, capital markets trades or other transactions are executed erroneously, as a result of illegal conduct or with unintended consequences\n\u2022\nfinancial losses, including due to loss-sharing requirements of CCPs, payment systems or other market infrastructures, or as possible restitution to clients and customers\n\u2022\nhigher operational costs associated with replacing services provided by a system that is unavailable\n\u2022\nclient or customer dissatisfaction with JPMorgan Chase\u2019s products and services\n\u2022\nregulatory fines, penalties, or other sanctions against JPMorgan Chase\n\u2022\nloss of confidence in the ability of JPMorgan Chase, or financial institutions generally, to protect against and withstand operational disruptions, or\n\u2022\nharm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\nAs the speed, frequency, volume, interconnectivity and complexity of transactions continue to increase, it can become more challenging to effectively maintain and upgrade JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational systems and infrastructure, especially due to the heightened risks that:\n\u2022\nattempts by third parties to defraud JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers may increase, evolve or become more complex, particularly during periods of market disruption or economic uncertainty\n\u2022\nerrors made by JPMorgan Chase or another market participant, whether inadvertent or malicious, cause widespread system disruption\n\u2022\nisolated or seemingly insignificant errors in operational systems compound, or migrate to other systems over time, to become larger issues\n\u2022\nfailures in synchronization or encryption software, or degraded performance of microprocessors, could cause disruptions in operational systems, or the inability of systems to communicate with each other, and\n\u2022\nthird parties may attempt to block the use of key technology solutions by claiming that the use infringes on their intellectual property rights.\nIf JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational systems, or those of newly-acquired businesses or of external parties on which \n22\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses depend, are unable to meet the requirements of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses and operations or bank regulatory standards, or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, JPMorgan Chase could be materially and adversely affected.\nA successful cyber attack affecting JPMorgan Chase could cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers.\nJPMorgan Chase experiences numerous attempted cyber attacks on its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets on a daily basis from various actors, including groups acting on behalf of hostile countries, cyber-criminals, \u201chacktivists\u201d (i.e., individuals or groups that use technology to promote a political agenda or social change) and others. These cyber attacks can take many forms, including attempts to introduce computer viruses or malicious code, which are commonly referred to as \u201cmalware,\u201d into JPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems. These attacks are often designed to:\n\u2022\nobtain unauthorized access to confidential information belonging to JPMorgan Chase or its clients, customers, counterparties or employees\n\u2022\nmanipulate data\n\u2022\ndestroy data or systems with the aim of rendering services unavailable\n\u2022\ndisrupt, sabotage or degrade service on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems\n\u2022\nsteal money, or\n\u2022\nextort money through the use of so-called \u201cransomware.\u201d\nJPMorgan Chase has also experienced significant distributed denial-of-service attacks which are intended to disrupt online banking services.\nJPMorgan Chase has experienced security breaches due to cyber attacks in the past, and it is inevitable that additional breaches will occur in the future. Any such breach could result in serious and harmful consequences for JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers.\nA principal reason that JPMorgan Chase cannot provide absolute security against cyber attacks is that it may not always be possible to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems, or to implement effective preventive measures against all breaches. This is because:\n\u2022\nthe techniques used in cyber attacks change frequently and are increasingly sophisticated, and therefore may not be recognized until launched\n\u2022\ncyber attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including JPMorgan Chase\u2019s own employees, cyber-criminals, hacktivists, groups linked to terrorist organizations or hostile countries, or third parties whose objective is to disrupt the operations of financial institutions more generally\n\u2022\nJPMorgan Chase does not have control over the cybersecurity of the systems of the large number of clients, customers, counterparties and third-party service providers with which it does business, and\n\u2022\nit is possible that a third party, after establishing a foothold on an internal network without being detected, might obtain access to other networks and systems.\nThe risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack could increase in the future due to factors such as: \n\u2022\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ongoing expansion of its mobile banking and other internet-based product offerings and its internal use of internet-based products and applications, including those that use cloud computing services\n\u2022\nthe acquisition of new businesses, and\n\u2022\nthe increased use of remote access and third party video conferencing solutions to facilitate work-from-home arrangements for employees. \nIn addition, a third party could misappropriate confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or communications from mobile devices used by JPMorgan Chase\u2019s employees.\nA successful penetration or circumvention of the security of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems or the systems of a vendor, governmental body or another market participant could cause serious negative consequences, including:\n\u2022\nsignificant disruption of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations and those of its clients, customers and counterparties, including losing access to operational systems\n\u2022\nmisappropriation of confidential information of JPMorgan Chase or that of its clients, customers, counterparties, employees or regulators\n\u2022\ndisruption of or damage to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems  and those of its clients, customers and counterparties\n\u2022\nthe inability, or extended delays in the ability, to fully recover and restore data that has been stolen, manipulated or destroyed, or the inability to prevent systems from processing fraudulent transactions\n\u2022\nviolations by JPMorgan Chase of applicable privacy and other laws\n\u2022\nfinancial loss to JPMorgan Chase or to its clients,  customers, counterparties or employees\n\u2022\nloss of confidence in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s cybersecurity and business resiliency measures\n\u2022\ndissatisfaction among JPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients, customers or counterparties\n\u2022\nsignificant exposure to litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and\n\u2022\nharm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\n23\nPart I\nThe extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps that JPMorgan Chase may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed. While such an investigation is ongoing, JPMorgan Chase may not necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyber attack, and that damage may continue to spread. These factors may inhibit JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to provide rapid, full and reliable information about the cyber attack to its clients, customers, counterparties and regulators, as well as the public. Furthermore, it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the harm caused by the cyber attack, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated. Any or all of these factors could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack.\nJPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected if it fails to identify and address operational risks associated with the introduction of or changes to products, services and delivery platforms.\nWhen JPMorgan Chase launches a new product or service, introduces a new platform for the delivery or distribution of products or services (including mobile connectivity, electronic trading and cloud computing), acquires or invests in a business or makes changes to an existing product, service or delivery platform, it may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from those changes, or may fail to implement adequate controls to mitigate the risks associated with those changes. Any significant failure in this regard could diminish JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to operate one or more of its businesses or result in:\n\u2022\npotential liability to clients, counterparties and customers\n\u2022\nincreased operating expenses\n\u2022\nhigher litigation costs, including regulatory fines, penalties and other sanctions\n\u2022\ndamage to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation\n\u2022\nimpairment of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s liquidity\n\u2022\nregulatory intervention, or \n\u2022\nweaker competitive standing.\nAny of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses and results of operations.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational costs and customer satisfaction could be adversely affected by the failure of an external operational system.\nExternal operational systems with which JPMorgan is connected, whether directly or indirectly, can be sources of operational risk to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase may be exposed not only to a systems failure or cyber attack that may be experienced by a vendor or market \ninfrastructure with which JPMorgan Chase is directly connected, but also to a systems breakdown or cyber attack involving another party to which such a vendor or infrastructure is connected. Similarly, retailers, data aggregators and other external parties with which JPMorgan Chase\u2019s customers do business can increase JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational risk. This is particularly the case where activities of customers or those parties are beyond JPMorgan Chase\u2019s security and control systems, including through the use of the internet, cloud computing services, and personal smart phones and other mobile devices or services. \nIf an external party obtains access to customer account data on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems, and that party experiences a cyberbreach of its own systems or misappropriates that data, this could result in a variety of negative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers, including:\n\u2022\nheightened risk that external parties will be able to execute fraudulent transactions using JPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems\n\u2022\nlosses from fraudulent transactions, as well as potential liability for losses that exceed thresholds established in consumer protection laws, rules and regulations\n\u2022\nincreased operational costs to remediate the consequences of the external party\u2019s security breach, and\n\u2022\nreputational harm arising from the perception that JPMorgan Chase\u2019s systems may not be secure.\nAs JPMorgan Chase\u2019s interconnectivity with clients, customers and other external parties continues to expand, JPMorgan Chase increasingly faces the risk of operational failure or cyber attacks with respect to the systems of those parties. Security breaches affecting JPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients or customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or human error or misconduct affecting other external parties, may require JPMorgan Chase to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information, including restricting the access of customers to their accounts. These actions can increase JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operational costs and potentially diminish customer satisfaction and confidence in JPMorgan Chase.\nFurthermore, the widespread and expanding interconnectivity among financial institutions, clearing banks, CCPs, payment processors, financial technology companies, securities exchanges, clearing houses and other financial market infrastructures increases the risk that the disruption of an operational system involving one institution or entity, including due to a cyber attack, may cause industry-wide operational disruptions that could materially affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to conduct business.\n24\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations rely on its ability, and the ability of key external parties, to maintain appropriately-staffed workforces, and on the competence, trustworthiness, health and safety of employees.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to operate its businesses efficiently and profitably, to offer products and services that meet the expectations of its clients and customers, and to maintain an effective risk management framework is highly dependent on its ability to staff its operations appropriately and on the competence, integrity, health and safety of its employees. JPMorgan Chase is similarly dependent on the workforces of other parties on which JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations rely, including vendors, custodians and financial markets infrastructures. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses could be materially and adversely affected by:\n\u2022\nthe ineffective implementation of business decisions\n\u2022\nany failure to institute controls that appropriately address risks associated with business activities, or to appropriately train employees with respect to those risks and controls\n\u2022\nstaffing shortages, particularly in tight labor markets\n\u2022\na significant operational breakdown or failure, theft, fraud or other unlawful conduct, or\n\u2022\nother negative outcomes caused by human error or misconduct by an employee of JPMorgan Chase or of another party on which JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations depend.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations could also be impaired if the measures taken by it or by governmental authorities to help ensure the health and safety of its employees are ineffective, or if any external party on which JPMorgan Chase relies fails to take appropriate and effective actions to protect the health and safety of its employees.\nJPMorgan Chase faces substantial legal and operational risks in safeguarding personal information.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses are subject to complex and evolving laws, rules and regulations, both within and outside the U.S., governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals. The protected parties can include:\n\u2022\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s current, prospective and former clients and customers\n\u2022\nclients and customers of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients and customers\n\u2022\ncurrent, prospective and former employees, and\n\u2022\nemployees of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s vendors, counterparties and other external parties.\nEnsuring that JPMorgan Chase\u2019s collection, use, sharing and storage of personal information comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions, including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict, can:\n\u2022\nincrease JPMorgan Chase\u2019s compliance and operating costs\n\u2022\nhinder the development of new products or services, curtail the offering of existing products or services, or affect how products and services are offered to clients and customers\n\u2022\ndemand significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase\u2019s management, and \n\u2022\nrequire JPMorgan Chase to structure its businesses, operations and systems in less efficient ways. \nNot all of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients, customers, vendors, counterparties and other external parties may have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information exchanged between them and JPMorgan Chase, particularly where information is transmitted by electronic means. JPMorgan Chase could be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions if personal information of clients, customers, employees or others were to be mishandled or misused, such as situations where such information is:\n\u2022\nerroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, or\n\u2022\nintercepted or otherwise compromised by unauthorized third parties.\nConcerns regarding the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that those measures are inadequate, could cause JPMorgan Chase to lose existing or potential clients and customers, and thereby reduce JPMorgan Chase\u2019s revenues. Furthermore, any failure or perceived failure by JPMorgan Chase to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, rules and regulations may subject it to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices, significant liabilities or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions. Any of these could damage JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses.\nIn recent years, well-publicized incidents involving the  inappropriate collection, use, sharing or storage of personal information have led to expanded governmental scrutiny of practices relating to the safeguarding of personal information by companies in the U.S. and other countries. That scrutiny has in some cases resulted in, and could in the future lead to, the adoption of stricter laws, rules and regulations relating to the collection, use, sharing and storage of personal information. These types of laws, rules and regulations could prohibit or significantly restrict financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase from sharing information among affiliates or with third parties such as vendors, and thereby increase compliance costs, or could restrict JPMorgan Chase\u2019s use of personal data when developing or offering products or services to customers. These restrictions could also inhibit JPMorgan Chase\u2019s \n25\nPart I\ndevelopment or marketing of certain products or services, or increase the costs of offering them to customers.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations, results and reputation could be harmed by occurrences of extraordinary events beyond its control.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business and operational systems could be seriously disrupted, and its reputation could be harmed, by events or contributing factors that are wholly or partially beyond its control, including material instances of:\n\u2022\ncyber attacks\n\u2022\nsecurity breaches of its physical premises, including threats to health and safety\n\u2022\npower, telecommunications or internet outages, or shutdowns of mass transit\n\u2022\nfailure of, or loss of access to, technology or operational systems, including any resulting loss of critical data\n\u2022\ndamage to or loss of property or assets of JPMorgan Chase or third parties, and any consequent injuries, including in connection with any construction projects undertaken by JPMorgan Chase\n\u2022\neffects of climate change\n\u2022\nnatural disasters or severe weather conditions\n\u2022\naccidents such as explosions or structural failures\n\u2022\nhealth emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics, or\n\u2022\nevents arising from local or larger-scale civil unrest, any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or terrorist acts.\nJPMorgan Chase maintains a Firmwide resiliency program that is intended to enable it to recover critical business functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology and facilities, in the event of a business disruption, including due to the occurrence of an extraordinary event beyond its control. There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase\u2019s resiliency plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to JPMorgan Chase, its clients, and customers and third parties with which it does business, or that its resiliency plans will be adequate to address the effects of simultaneous occurrences of multiple business disruption events. In addition, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to respond effectively to a business disruption event could be hampered to the extent that the members of its workforce, physical assets or systems and other support infrastructure needed to address the event are geographically dispersed, or conversely, if such an event were to occur in an area in which they are concentrated. Further, should extraordinary events or the factors that cause or contribute to those events become more chronic, the disruptive effects of those events on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business and operations, and on its clients, customers, \ncounterparties and employees, could become more significant and long-lasting. \nAny significant failure or disruption of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations or operational systems, or the occurrence of one or more extraordinary events that are beyond its control, could:\n\u2022\nhinder JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to provide services to its clients and customers or to transact with its counterparties\n\u2022\nrequire it to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption or to address the event\n\u2022\ncause it to incur losses or liabilities, including from loss of revenue, damage to or loss of property, or injuries\n\u2022\ndisrupt market infrastructure systems on which JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses rely \n\u2022\nexpose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and\n\u2022\nharm its reputation.\nEnhanced regulatory and other standards for the oversight of vendors and other service providers can result in higher costs and other potential exposures.\nJPMorgan Chase must comply with enhanced regulatory and other standards associated with doing business with vendors and other service providers, including standards relating to the outsourcing of functions as well as the performance of significant banking and other functions by subsidiaries. JPMorgan Chase incurs significant costs and expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its internal and external service providers. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s failure to appropriately assess and manage these relationships, especially those involving significant banking functions, shared services or other critical activities, could materially adversely affect JPMorgan Chase. Specifically, any such failure could result in:\n\u2022\npotential harm to clients and customers, and any liability associated with that harm\n\u2022\nregulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions\n\u2022\nlower revenues, and the opportunity cost from lost revenues\n\u2022\nincreased operational costs, or\n\u2022\nharm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s risk management framework may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to JPMorgan Chase.\nAny inadequacy or lapse in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s risk management framework, governance structure, practices, models or reporting systems could expose it to unexpected losses, and its financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Any such inadequacy or lapse could:\n26\n\u2022\nhinder the timely escalation of material risk issues to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s senior management and Board of Directors\n\u2022\nlead to business decisions that have negative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase\n\u2022\nrequire significant resources and time to remediate\n\u2022\nlead to non-compliance with laws, rules and regulations\n\u2022\nattract heightened regulatory scrutiny\n\u2022\nexpose JPMorgan Chase to regulatory investigations or legal proceedings\n\u2022\nsubject it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions\n\u2022\nlead to potential harm to customers and clients, and any liability associated with that harm\n\u2022\nharm its reputation, or \n\u2022\notherwise diminish confidence in JPMorgan Chase.\nJPMorgan Chase relies on data to assess its various risk exposures. Any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s data gathering, analysis and validation processes could result in ineffective risk management practices. These deficiencies could also result in inaccurate risk reporting.\nMany of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s risk management strategies and techniques consider historical market behavior and to some degree are based on management\u2019s subjective judgment or assumptions. For example, many models used by JPMorgan Chase are based on assumptions regarding historical correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress, including difficult or less liquid market environments, or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated. Conversely, previously-correlated indicators may become uncorrelated at those times. Sudden market movements and unanticipated market or economic movements could, in some circumstances, limit the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s risk management strategies, causing it to incur losses.\nJPMorgan Chase could recognize unexpected losses, its capital levels could be reduced and it could face greater regulatory scrutiny if its models, estimations or judgments, including those used in its financial statements, prove to be inadequate or incorrect.\nJPMorgan Chase has developed and uses a variety of models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations to measure, monitor and implement controls over its market, credit, capital, liquidity, operational and other risks. JPMorgan Chase also uses internal models and estimations as a basis for its stress testing and in connection with the preparation of its financial statements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). \nThese models and estimations are based on a variety of assumptions and historical trends, and are periodically reviewed and modified as necessary. The models and estimations that JPMorgan Chase uses may not be effective in all cases to identify, observe and mitigate risk due to a variety of factors, such as:\n\u2022\nreliance on historical trends that may not persist in the future, including assumptions underlying the models and estimations such as correlations among certain market indicators or asset prices\n\u2022\ninherent limitations associated with forecasting uncertain economic and financial outcomes\n\u2022\nhistorical trend information may be incomplete, or may not be indicative of severely negative market conditions such as extreme volatility, dislocation or lack of liquidity\n\u2022\nsudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain financial instruments\n\u2022\ntechnology that is introduced to run models or estimations may not perform as expected, or may not be well understood by the personnel using the technology\n\u2022\nmodels and estimations may contain erroneous data, valuations, formulas or algorithms, and\n\u2022\nreview processes may fail to detect flaws in models and estimations.\nJPMorgan Chase may experience unexpected losses if models, estimates or judgments used or applied in connection with its risk management activities or the preparation of its financial statements prove to have been inadequate or incorrect. For example, where quoted market prices are not available for certain financial instruments that require a determination of their fair value, JPMorgan Chase may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment. \nSimilarly, JPMorgan Chase establishes an allowance for expected credit losses related to its credit exposures which requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations. These types of estimates and judgments may not prove to be accurate due to a variety of factors, as noted above. In addition, certain models used by JPMorgan Chase as a basis for the determination of the allowance for expected credit losses experienced heightened performance risk in the economic environment during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. These models are based on historical experience of internally-developed macroeconomic scenarios, and when the current and forecasted environment is significantly different from the scenarios \n27\nPart I\nunderlying those models, JPMorgan Chase may need to apply a greater degree of judgment and analytics to inform any adjustments that it has made or may make to model outputs.\nSome of the models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations used by JPMorgan Chase in managing risks are subject to review by, and require the approval of, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s regulators. These reviews are required before JPMorgan Chase may use those models and estimations for calculating market risk RWA, credit risk RWA and operational risk RWA under Basel III. If JPMorgan Chase\u2019s models or estimations are not approved by its regulators, it may be subject to higher capital charges, which could adversely affect its financial results or limit the ability to expand its businesses. \nLapses in controls over disclosure or financial reporting could materially affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s profitability or reputation.\nThere can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance, or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not occur. Any such lapses or deficiencies could result in inaccurate financial reporting which, in turn, could:\n\u2022\nmaterially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business and results of operations or financial condition\n\u2022\nrestrict its ability to access the capital markets \n\u2022\nrequire it to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies\n\u2022\nexpose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions\n\u2022\nharm its reputation, or \n\u2022\notherwise diminish investor confidence in JPMorgan Chase. \nStrategic\nIf JPMorgan Chase\u2019s management fails to develop and execute effective business strategies, and to anticipate changes affecting those strategies, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s competitive standing and results could suffer.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business strategies significantly affect its competitive standing and operations.\u00a0These strategies relate to:\n\u2022\nthe products and services that JPMorgan Chase offers\n\u2022\nthe geographies in which it operates\n\u2022\nthe types of clients and customers that it serves\n\u2022\nthe businesses that it acquires or in which it invests\n\u2022\nthe counterparties with which it does business, and \n\u2022\nthe methods and distribution channels by which it offers products and services. \nIf management makes choices about these strategies and goals that prove to be incorrect, do not accurately assess the competitive landscape and industry trends, or fail to address changing regulatory and market environments or the expectations of clients, customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders, then the franchise values and growth prospects of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses may suffer and its earnings could decline.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s growth prospects also depend on management\u2019s ability to develop and execute effective business plans to address these strategic priorities, both in the near term and over longer time horizons. Management\u2019s effectiveness in this regard will affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to develop and enhance its resources, control expenses and return capital to shareholders.\u00a0Each of these objectives could be adversely affected by any failure on the part of management to:\n\u2022\ndevise effective business plans and strategies\n\u2022\noffer products and services that meet changing expectations of clients and customers\n\u2022\nallocate capital in a manner that promotes long-term stability to enable JPMorgan Chase to build and invest in market-leading businesses, even in a highly stressed environment\n\u2022\nallocate capital appropriately due to imprecise modeling or subjective judgments made in connection with those allocations\n\u2022\nappropriately address concerns of clients, customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders, including with respect to social and sustainability matters\n\u2022\nreact quickly to changes in market conditions or market structures, or\n\u2022\ndevelop and enhance the operational, technology, risk, financial and managerial resources necessary to grow and manage JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses.\nFurthermore, JPMorgan Chase may incur costs in connection with disposing of excess properties, premises and facilities, and those costs could be material to its results of operations in a given period.\nJPMorgan Chase faces significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry.\nJPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive environment in which it must evolve and adapt to the significant changes as a result of changes in financial regulation, technological advances, increased public scrutiny and changes in economic conditions. JPMorgan Chase expects that competition in the U.S. and global financial services industry will continue to be intense. Competitors include:\n\u2022\nother banks and financial institutions\n\u2022\ntrading, advisory and investment management firms\n28\n\u2022\nfinance companies\n\u2022\ntechnology companies, and\n\u2022\nother nonbank firms that are engaged in providing similar products and services.\nJPMorgan Chase cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations.\nNew competitors in the financial services industry continue to emerge. For example, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products. These advances have also allowed financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities and cryptocurrency trading, payments processing and online automated algorithmic-based investment advice. Furthermore, both financial institutions and their non-banking competitors face the risk that payments processing and other products and services, including deposits and other traditional banking products, could be significantly disrupted by the use of new technologies, such as cryptocurrencies and other applications that use secure distributed ledgers, that require no intermediation. New technologies have required and could require JPMorgan Chase to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain clients and customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors, including technology companies. In addition, new technologies may be used by customers, or breached or infiltrated by third parties, in unexpected ways, which can increase JPMorgan Chase\u2019s costs for complying with laws, rules and regulations that apply to the offering of products and services through those technologies and reduce the income that JPMorgan Chase earns from providing products and services through those technologies.\nOngoing or increased competition may put pressure on the pricing for JPMorgan Chase\u2019s products and services or may cause JPMorgan Chase to lose market share, particularly with respect to traditional banking products. This competition may be on the basis of quality and variety of products and services offered, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. The failure of any of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers, whether due to general market conditions, under-performance, a decision not to offer a particular product or service, changes in client and customer expectations or other factors, could affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to attract or retain clients and customers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce JPMorgan Chase\u2019s revenues. Increased competition also may require JPMorgan Chase to make additional capital investments in its businesses, or to extend more of its capital on behalf of its clients in order to remain competitive.\nThe effects of climate change could adversely impact JPMorgan Chase and its clients.\n \nJPMorgan Chase operates in many regions, countries and communities around the world where its businesses, and the activities of its clients and customers, could be impacted by climate change. Climate change could manifest as a financial risk to JPMorgan Chase either through changes in the physical climate or from the process of transitioning to a low-carbon economy, including changes in climate policy or in the regulation of financial institutions with respect to risks posed by climate change.\nClimate-related physical risks include acute weather events, such as hurricanes and floods, and chronic shifts in the climate, such as altered distribution and intensity of rainfall, prolonged droughts or flooding, increased frequency of wildfires, rising sea levels, or a rising heat index. Climate-related physical risks could have adverse financial and other impacts on JPMorgan Chase, both directly on its business and operations and as a result of impacts to its clients and customers, including:\n\u2022\ndeclines in asset values, including due to the destruction or degradation of property\n\u2022\nreduced availability of insurance\n\u2022\nsignificant interruptions to business operations, including supply chain disruption, and\n\u2022\nsystemic changes to geographies, regional economies and sectors, and any resulting population migration or unemployment.\nTransition risks arise from the process of adjusting to a low-carbon economy. In addition to possible changes in climate policy and financial regulation, potential transition risks may include economic and other changes engendered by the development of low-carbon technological advances (e.g., electric vehicles and renewable energy) and/or changes in consumer preferences towards low-carbon goods and services. Transition risks could be further accelerated by the occurrence of changes in the physical climate. The possible adverse impacts of transition risks to both JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers include: \n\u2022\nsudden devaluation of assets, including unanticipated write-downs (\u201cstranded assets\u201d)\n\u2022\nincreased operational and compliance costs driven by changes in climate policy and/or regulations \n\u2022\nnegative consequences to business models, and the need to make changes in response to those consequences, and\n\u2022\ndamage to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation, including as a result of any perception that its business practices are contrary to public policy or stakeholder preferences.\nBoth physical risks and transition risks could have negative impacts on the revenues, financial condition or creditworthiness of JPMorgan\u2019s clients and customers, and on its exposure to those clients and customers.\n29\nPart I\nConduct\nConduct failure by JPMorgan Chase employees can harm clients and customers, impact market integrity, damage JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation and trigger litigation and regulatory action.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s employees interact with clients, customers and counterparties, and with each other, every day.\u00a0All employees are expected to demonstrate values and exhibit the behaviors that are an integral part of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Code of Conduct and How We Do Business Principles, including JPMorgan Chase\u2019s commitment to \u201cdo first class business in a first class way.\u201d JPMorgan Chase endeavors to embed conduct risk management throughout an employee\u2019s life cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training and development, and performance management.\u00a0Conduct risk management is also an integral component of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s promotion and compensation processes.\nNotwithstanding these expectations, policies and practices, certain employees have engaged in improper or illegal conduct in the past. These instances of misconduct have resulted in litigation, and resolutions of governmental investigations or enforcement actions involving consent orders, deferred prosecution agreements, non-prosecution agreements and other civil or criminal sanctions. There is no assurance that further inappropriate or unlawful actions by employees will not occur, lead to a violation of the terms of these resolutions (and associated consequences), or that any such actions will always be detected, deterred or prevented.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation could be harmed, and collateral consequences could result, from a failure by one or more employees to conduct themselves in accordance with JPMorgan Chase\u2019s expectations, policies and practices, including by acting in ways that harm clients, customers, other market participants or other employees. Some examples of this include:\n\u2022\nimproperly selling and marketing JPMorgan Chase\u2019s products or services\n\u2022\nengaging in insider trading, market manipulation or unauthorized trading\n\u2022\nengaging in improper or fraudulent behavior in connection with government relief programs\n\u2022\nfacilitating a transaction where a material objective is to achieve a particular tax, accounting or financial disclosure treatment that may be subject to scrutiny by governmental or regulatory authorities, or where the proposed treatment is unclear or may not reflect the economic substance of the transaction\n\u2022\nfailing to fulfill fiduciary obligations or other duties owed to clients or customers\n\u2022\nviolating antitrust or anti-competition laws by colluding with other market participants\n\u2022\nusing electronic communications channels that have not been approved by JPMorgan Chase\n\u2022\nengaging in discriminatory behavior or harassment with respect to clients, customers or employees, or acting contrary to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s goal of fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace\n\u2022\nmanaging or reporting risks in ways that subordinate JPMorgan Chase\u2019s risk appetite to business performance goals or employee compensation objectives, and\n\u2022\nmisappropriating property, confidential or proprietary information, or technology assets belonging to JPMorgan Chase, its clients and customers or third parties.\nThe consequences of any failure by one or more employees to conduct themselves in accordance with JPMorgan Chase\u2019s expectations, policies or practices could include litigation, or regulatory or other governmental investigations or enforcement actions. Any of these proceedings or actions could result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, or lead to:\n\u2022\nfinancial losses\n\u2022\nincreased operational and compliance costs\n\u2022\ngreater scrutiny by regulators and other parties\n\u2022\nregulatory actions that require JPMorgan Chase to restructure, curtail or cease certain of its activities\n\u2022\nthe need for significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase\u2019s management\n\u2022\nloss of clients or customers, and\n\u2022\nharm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\nThe foregoing risks could be heightened with respect to newly-acquired businesses if JPMorgan Chase fails to successfully integrate employees of those businesses or any of those employees do not conduct themselves in accordance with JPMorgan Chase's expectations, policies and practices.\nReputation\nDamage to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation could harm its businesses.\nMaintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to its ability to attract and retain clients, customers, investors and employees. Damage to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation can therefore cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business and prospects, and can arise from numerous sources, including:\n\u2022\nemployee misconduct, including discriminatory behavior or harassment with respect to clients, customers or employees, or actions that are contrary to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s goal of fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace\n30\n\u2022\nsecurity breaches, including as a result of cyber attacks\n\u2022\nfailure to safeguard client, customer or employee information\n\u2022\nfailure to manage risks associated with its business activities or those of its clients, including those that may be unpopular among one or more constituencies\n\u2022\nfailure to fully discharge publicly-announced commitments to support social and sustainability initiatives\n\u2022\nnon-compliance with laws, rules, and regulations \n\u2022\noperational failures\n\u2022\nlitigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions \n\u2022\nactions taken in executing regulatory and governmental requirements during a global or regional health emergency\n\u2022\nregulatory investigations or enforcement actions, or resolutions of these matters, and \n\u2022\nfailure or perceived failure to comply with laws, rules or regulations by JPMorgan Chase or its clients, customers, counterparties or other parties, including newly-acquired businesses, companies in which JPMorgan Chase has made principal investments, parties to joint ventures with JPMorgan Chase, and vendors with which JPMorgan Chase does business.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation may be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding JPMorgan Chase, whether or not true, that may be published or broadcast by the media or posted on social media, non-mainstream news services or other parts of the internet. This latter risk can be magnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which information is disseminated through those channels.\nSocial and environmental activists are increasingly targeting financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase with public criticism for their relationships with clients that are engaged in certain sensitive industries, including businesses whose products are or are perceived to be harmful to human health, or whose activities negatively affect or are perceived to negatively affect the environment, workers\u2019 rights or communities. Activists have also engaged in public protests at JPMorgan Chase\u2019s headquarters and other properties. Activist criticism of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s relationships with clients in sensitive industries could potentially engender dissatisfaction among clients, customers, investors and employees with how JPMorgan Chase addresses social and sustainability concerns in its business activities. Alternatively, yielding to activism targeted at certain sensitive industries could damage JPMorgan Chase\u2019s relationships with clients and customers, and with governmental or regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase does business, whose views are not aligned with those of social and \nenvironmental activists. In either case, the resulting harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation could:\n \n\u2022\ncause certain clients and customers to cease doing business with JPMorgan Chase \n\u2022\nimpair JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to attract new clients and customers, or to expand its relationships with existing clients and customers\n\u2022\ndiminish JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to hire or retain employees\n\u2022\nprompt JPMorgan Chase to cease doing business with certain clients or customers.\n\u2022\ncause certain investors to divest from investments in securities of JPMorgan Chase, or\n\u2022\nattract scrutiny from governmental or regulatory bodies.\nActions by the financial services industry generally or individuals in the industry can also affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation. For example, the reputation of the industry as a whole can be damaged by concerns that:\n\u2022\nconsumers have been treated unfairly by a financial institution, or\n\u2022\na financial institution has acted inappropriately with respect to the methods used to offer products to customers\nIf JPMorgan Chase is perceived to have engaged in these types of behaviors, this could weaken its reputation among clients or customers.\nFailure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest or to satisfy fiduciary obligations can result in litigation and enforcement actions, as well as damage JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to manage potential conflicts of interest is highly complex due to the broad range of its business activities which encompass a variety of transactions, obligations and interests with and among JPMorgan Chase\u2019s clients and customers. JPMorgan Chase can become subject to litigation and enforcement actions, and its reputation can be damaged, by the failure or perceived failure to:\n\u2022\nadequately address or appropriately disclose conflicts of interest, including potential conflicts of interest that may arise in connection with providing multiple products and services in, or having one or more investments related to, the same transaction\n\u2022\ndeliver appropriate standards of service and quality\n\u2022\ntreat clients and customers with the appropriate standard of care\n\u2022\nuse client and customer data responsibly and in a manner that meets legal requirements and regulatory expectations\n31\nPart I\n\u2022\nprovide fiduciary products or services in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory standards, or \n\u2022\nhandle or use confidential information of customers or clients appropriately or in compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws, rules and regulations. \nA failure or perceived failure to appropriately address conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations could result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions, all of which can lead to lost revenue and higher operating costs and cause serious harm to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation.\nCountry\nAn outbreak or escalation of hostilities between countries or within a country or region could have a material adverse effect on the global economy and on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses within the affected region or globally. \nAggressive actions by hostile governments or groups, including armed conflict or intensified cyber attacks, could expand in unpredictable ways by drawing in other countries or escalating into full-scale war with potentially catastrophic consequences, particularly if one or more of the combatants possess nuclear weapons. Depending on the scope of the conflict, the hostilities could result in:\n\u2022\nworldwide economic disruption\n\u2022\nheightened volatility in financial markets\n\u2022\nsevere declines in asset values, accompanied by widespread sell-offs of investments\n\u2022\nsubstantial depreciation of local currencies, potentially leading to defaults by borrowers and counterparties in the affected region\n\u2022\ndisruption of global trade, and \n\u2022\ndiminished consumer, business and investor confidence.\nAny of the above consequences could have significant negative effects on JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations and earnings, both in the countries or regions directly affected by the hostilities or globally. Further, if the U.S. were to become directly involved in such a conflict, this could lead to a curtailment of any operations that JPMorgan Chase may have in the affected countries or region, as well as in any nation that is aligned against the U.S. in the hostilities. JPMorgan Chase could also experience more numerous and aggressive cyber attacks launched by or under the sponsorship of one or more of the adversaries in such a conflict.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s business and operations in certain countries can be adversely affected by local economic, political, regulatory and social factors.\nSome of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase conducts business have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile or may have political, legal and \nregulatory regimes that are less established or predictable than other countries in which JPMorgan Chase operates. In addition, in some jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase conducts business, the local economy and business activity are subject to substantial government influence or control. Some of these countries have in the past experienced economic disruptions, including:\n\u2022\nextreme currency fluctuations\n\u2022\nhigh inflation\n\u2022\nlow or negative growth, and\n\u2022\ndefaults or reduced ability to service sovereign debt.\nThe governments in these countries have sometimes reacted to these developments by imposing restrictive policies that adversely affect the local and regional business environment, such as:\n\u2022\nprice, capital or exchange controls, including imposition of punitive transfer and convertibility restrictions or forced currency exchange\n\u2022\nexpropriation or nationalization of assets or confiscation of property, including intellectual property, and\n\u2022\nchanges in laws, rules and regulations. \nThe impact of these actions could be accentuated in trading markets that are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than more-developed markets. These types of government actions can negatively affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations in the relevant country, either directly or by suppressing the business activities of local clients or multi-national clients that conduct business in the jurisdiction. \nIn addition, emerging markets countries, as well as certain more developed countries, have been susceptible to unfavorable social developments arising from poor economic conditions or governmental actions, including: \n\u2022\nwidespread demonstrations, civil unrest or general strikes \n\u2022\ncrime and corruption\n\u2022\nsecurity and personal safety issues\n\u2022\nan outbreak or escalation of hostilities\n\u2022\noverthrow of incumbent governments\n\u2022\nterrorist attacks, and \n\u2022\nother forms of internal discord. \nThese economic, political, regulatory and social developments have in the past resulted in, and in the future could lead to, conditions that can adversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations in those countries and impair the revenues, growth and profitability of those operations. In addition, any of these events or circumstances in one country can affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s operations and investments in another country or countries, including in the U.S.\n32\nPeople\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to attract and retain qualified and diverse employees is critical to its success.\nJPMorgan Chase\u2019s employees are its most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. JPMorgan Chase endeavors to\u00a0attract talented and diverse new employees and retain, develop and motivate its existing employees. JPMorgan Chase's efforts to retain talented and diverse employees can be particularly challenging when members of its workforce are targeted for recruitment by competitors. If JPMorgan Chase were unable to continue to attract or retain qualified and diverse employees, including successors to the Chief Executive Officer, members of the Operating Committee and other senior leaders, JPMorgan Chase\u2019s performance, including its competitive position, could be materially and adversely affected.\nUnfavorable changes in immigration or travel policies could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses and operations. \nJPMorgan Chase relies on the skills, knowledge and expertise of employees located throughout the world. Changes in immigration or travel policies in the U.S. and other countries that unduly restrict or otherwise make it more difficult for employees or their family members to work in, or travel to or transfer between, jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase has operations or conducts its business could inhibit JPMorgan Chase\u2019s ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and thereby dilute the quality of its workforce, or could prompt JPMorgan Chase to make structural changes to its worldwide or regional operating models that cause its operations to be less efficient or more costly.\nLegal\nJPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks from litigation and formal and informal regulatory and government investigations.\nJPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in many legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. Actions currently pending against JPMorgan Chase may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions adverse to JPMorgan Chase. Any of these matters could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that JPMorgan Chase will continue to experience a high level of litigation and regulatory and government investigations related to its businesses and operations.\nRegulators and other government agencies conduct examinations of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries both on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and JPMorgan Chase\u2019s businesses and operations are subject to \nheightened regulatory oversight. This heightened regulatory scrutiny, or the results of such an investigation or examination, may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. There is no assurance that those actions will not result in resolutions or other enforcement actions against JPMorgan Chase. Furthermore, a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal, state or local agencies and officials in the U.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other governmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nIf another financial institution violates a law or regulation relating to a particular business activity or practice, this will often give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar activity or practice by JPMorgan Chase. \nThese and other initiatives by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental authorities may subject JPMorgan Chase to judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, and may require JPMorgan Chase to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services. All of these potential outcomes could harm JPMorgan Chase\u2019s reputation or lead to higher operational costs, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase\u2019s profitability, or result in collateral consequences. In addition, the extent of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s exposure to legal and regulatory matters can be unpredictable and could, in some cases, exceed the amount of reserves that JPMorgan Chase has established for those matters.\n33\nParts I and II", "item7": ">Item 7.
