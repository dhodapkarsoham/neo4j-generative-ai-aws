(the Company or Martin Marietta) is a natural resource-based building materials company.\u00a0\u00a0The Company supplies aggregates (crushed stone, sand and gravel) through its network of approximately 350 quarries, mines and distribution yards in 28 states, Canada and The Bahamas.\u00a0\u00a0In 2021, the aggregates product gross profit accounted for 67% of the Company\u2019s consolidated total product and services gross profit.\u00a0\u00a0Martin Marietta also provides cement and downstream products, namely, ready mixed concrete, asphalt and paving services, in markets that are naturally vertically integrated and where the Company has a leading aggregates position.\u00a0\u00a0The Company\u2019s heavy-side building materials are used in infrastructure, nonresidential and residential construction projects.\u00a0\u00a0Aggregates are also used in agricultural, utility and environmental applications and as railroad ballast.\u00a0\u00a0The aggregates, cement, ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations are reported collectively as the \u201cBuilding Materials business\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0The Company also operates a Magnesia Specialties business with production facilities in Michigan and Ohio.\u00a0\u00a0The Magnesia Specialties business produces magnesia-based chemical products that are used in industrial, agricultural and environmental applications.\u00a0\u00a0It also produces dolomitic lime sold primarily to customers for steel production and land stabilization.\u00a0\u00a0Magnesia Specialties\u2019 products are shipped to customers domestically and worldwide. \n\n\nOn October 1, 2021, the Company acquired the Lehigh Hanson West Region business (Lehigh West Region) for $2.28 billion in cash. The acquisition included a portfolio of 17 active aggregates quarries, two cement plants with related distribution terminals, and targeted downstream operations in California, Arizona, Nevada and Oregon. These operations provided a new upstream, materials-led growth platform across several of the nation\u2019s largest megaregions in California and Arizona, solidifying the Company\u2019s position as a leading coast-to-coast aggregates producer.  The acquired cement plants, distribution terminals and California ready mixed concrete operations are classified as assets held for sale and discontinued operations as of December 31, 2021.\u00a0\u00a0The Lehigh West Region business is reported in the Company\u2019s West Group.\n\n\nOn July 30, 2021, the Company acquired assets of Southern Crushed Concrete (SCC). SCC is a leading producer of recycled concrete in the Houston area, one of the country\u2019s largest aggregates markets. Recycled concrete is principally used as a base aggregates product in infrastructure, commercial and residential construction applications.\u00a0\u00a0SCC is reported in the Company\u2019s West Group.\n\n\nOn April 30, 2021, the Company completed its acquisition of Tiller Corporation (Tiller), a leading aggregates and hot mix asphalt supplier in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area, a large and fast-growing midwestern metropolitan area. The Tiller acquisition complements the Company\u2019s existing product offerings in the surrounding areas.\u00a0 Additionally, Tiller sells asphalt \nsolely as a materials provider and does not offer paving or other associated services. Tiller is reported in the Company\u2019s East Group.\n\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS PRIOR TO 2021, SEE THE INFORMATION APPEARING UNDER THE HEADING \u201cGENERAL\u201d INCLUDED IN \nPART I, ITEM 1\n OF THE COMPANY\u2019S \nFORM 10-K\n FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER\u00a031, 2019, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.\n\n\nBusiness Segment Information\n\n\nThe Company conducts its Building Materials business through two reportable segments, organized by geography: East Group and West Group. The East Group provides aggregates and asphalt products only. The West Group provides aggregates, cement and downstream products. The ten largest revenue-generating states accounted for 84% of the Building Materials business total revenues in 2021: Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Minnesota, Iowa, Florida, South Carolina, Indiana and Maryland. The Company\u2019s Magnesia Specialties business is reported as a separate segment, which includes its magnesia-based chemicals and dolomitic lime businesses.\u00a0\u00a0For more information on the organization and geographic area of the Company\u2019s business segments, \nsee \u201c\nNote A: Accounting Policies\n\u201d and \u201c\nNote P: Segments\n\u201d of the \u201cNotes to Financial Statements\u201d of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements, which appear in Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this Form 10-K), which information is incorporated by reference.\n \n\n\nBuilding Materials Business\n\n\nThe profitability of the Building Materials business, which serves customers in the construction marketplace, is sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions and cyclical swings in construction spending, which are in turn affected by fluctuations in levels of public-sector infrastructure funding; interest rates; access to capital markets; and demographic, \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n \nPage 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPart I\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n\u00a0\u00a0Item 1 \u2013 Business\n\n\ngeographic, employment and population dynamics. The heavy-side construction business\n \nis conducted outdoors\n, as are much of the Building Materials business\u2019s operations\n. Therefore, erratic weather patterns, seasonal changes, and other weather-related conditions, including precipitation, flooding, hurricanes, snowstorms, extreme temperatures\n, wildfires\n, earthquakes\n and droughts, can significantly affect production schedules, shipments, costs, efficiencies and profitability.\u00a0\u00a0Generally, the financial results for the first and fourth quarters are subject to the impacts of winter weather, while the second and third quarters are subject to the impacts of heavy precipitation.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe Building Materials business markets its products primarily to the construction industry, with 34% of its 2021 organic aggregates shipments sold to contractors in connection with highway and other public infrastructure projects and the balance of its organic shipments sold primarily to contractors for nonresidential and residential construction projects. The Company also believes exposure to fluctuations in nonresidential and residential, or private-sector, construction spending is lessened by the business\u2019 mix of public sector-related shipments.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nFunding of public infrastructure, historically the Company\u2019s largest end-use market, is discussed in greater detail under \u201c\nBuilding Materials Business\u2019 Key Considerations\u2014Public Infrastructure\n\u201d in \nItem 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n,\u2019\u2019 of this Form 10-K. \n \n\n\nThe Building Materials business covers a wide geographic area.\u00a0\u00a0The five largest revenue-generating states, determined by state of destination, (Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Minnesota) accounted for 68% of the Building Materials business\u2019 total revenues by state of destination in 2021.\u00a0\u00a0The Building Materials business is accordingly affected by the economies in these regions and has been adversely affected in part by recessions and weaknesses in these economies from time to time. In 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic impacted the global economy.\u00a0\u00a0The Company, being considered an essential business, continued to operate but experienced a modest decline in aggregates shipments in 2020 due to a slowdown in overall construction activity and only modest growth in organic aggregates shipments in 2021.\n\n\nAggregates\n\n\nAggregates, consisting of crushed stone, sand and gravel, are an engineered, granular material that is manufactured to specific sizes, grades and chemistry for use primarily in construction applications.\u00a0\u00a0The Company\u2019s operations consist primarily of open pit quarries; however, the Company is the largest operator of underground aggregates mines in the United States, with 14 active underground mines located in the East Group.\n\n\nNatural aggregates sources can be found in relatively homogeneous deposits in certain areas of the United States.\u00a0\u00a0As a general rule, the distance covered by truck shipments from an individual quarry is limited because the cost of transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the price of the product itself. As described below, the Company\u2019s distribution system mainly uses trucks, but also has access to a waterborne network where the per-mile unit cost of transporting aggregates is much lower.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, acquisitions have enabled the Company to extend its customer base through increased access to rail transportation. Proximity of quarry facilities to customers\u2019 construction sites or to long-haul transportation corridors is an important factor in competition for aggregates businesses.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s distribution network moves aggregates materials from certain domestic and offshore sources via its long-haul rail and waterborne distribution network, to markets where aggregates supply is limited.\u00a0\u00a0The Company\u2019s rail network primarily serves its Texas, Florida, Colorado and Gulf Coast markets while the Company\u2019s locations in The Bahamas and Nova Scotia transport materials via oceangoing ships. The Company\u2019s strategic focus includes expanding inland and offshore capacity and acquiring distribution facilities and port locations to offload transported material.\u00a0\u00a0At December 31, 2021, the Company\u2019s aggregates distribution facilities consisted of 84 terminals.\u00a0\u00a0The long-haul distribution network can diversify market risk for locations that engage in long-haul transportation of their aggregates products.\u00a0\u00a0The risk of a downturn in one market may be somewhat mitigated by other markets served by the location, particularly where a producing quarry serves a local market and transports products via rail, water and/or truck to be sold in other markets.\u00a0\u00a0However, the Company\u2019s expansion of its rail-based distribution network, coupled with the extensive use of rail service, increases the Company\u2019s dependence on and exposure to railroad performance, including track congestion, crew availability, railcar availability, locomotive availability, and the ability to renegotiate favorable railroad shipping contracts.\u00a0\u00a0The waterborne distribution network also increases the Company\u2019s exposure to certain risks, including, among other items, meeting minimum tonnage requirements of shipping contracts, demurrage costs, fuel costs, ship availability and weather disruptions.\u00a0\u00a0The Company has long-term agreements \nwith shipping companies to provide ships to transport the Company\u2019s aggregates to various coastal ports.\n\n\nThe Company generally acquires contiguous property around existing quarry locations. This property can serve as buffer property or additional mineral reserve capacity, assuming the underlying geology supports economical aggregates mining. In \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n \nPage 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPart I\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n\u00a0\u00a0Item 1 \u2013 Business\n\n\neither instance, the acquisition of additional property around an existing quarry allows the expansion of the quarry footprint and extension of quarry life. Some locations having limited reserves may be unable to expand. \n\n\nA long-term capital focus for the Company, primarily in the midwestern United States due to the nature of its indigenous aggregates supply, is underground limestone aggregates mines. Production costs are generally higher at underground mines than surface quarries since the depth of the aggregates deposits and the access to the reserves result in higher costs related to development, explosives and depreciation costs. However, these locations often possess marketplace transportation advantages that can lead to higher average selling prices than more distant surface quarries.\n\n\nThe construction aggregates industry has been consolidating, and the Company has actively participated in the industry\u2019s consolidation. When acquired, new locations sometimes do not satisfy the Company\u2019s internal safety, maintenance, pit development, or other standards, and may require additional resources before benefits of the acquisitions are fully realized. Acquisition opportunities include public and large private, family-owned businesses, as well as asset swaps and divestitures from companies executing their strategic plans, rationalizing non-core assets, and repairing financially-constrained balance sheets. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors and management continue to review and monitor the Company\u2019s long-term strategic plans, commonly referred to as SOAR (Strategic Operating Analysis and Review), which include assessing business combinations and arrangements with other companies engaged in similar businesses, increasing the Company\u2019s presence in its core businesses, investing in internal \nexpansion projects in high-growth markets, and pursuing new opportunities related to the Company\u2019s existing markets.\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nEnvironmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries and to develop new quarry operations. Although it cannot be predicted what policies will be adopted in the future by federal, state, and local governmental bodies regarding these matters, the Company anticipates that future restrictions will likely make zoning and permitting more difficult, thereby potentially enhancing the value of the Company\u2019s existing mineral reserves.\n\n\nManagement believes its aggregates reserves are sufficient to permit production at present operational levels for the foreseeable future. The Company does not anticipate any significant difficulty in obtaining reserves used for production. The Company\u2019s aggregates reserves average approximately 78 years, based on current production levels. However, certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand. Moreover, as noted above, environmental and zoning regulations\n will likely make it harder for the Company to expand its existing quarries or develop new quarry operations\n. \n\n\nThe Company generally sells its aggregates, ready mixed concrete and asphalt products upon receipt of customer orders or requests. The Company generally maintains inventories of aggregates products in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements of customers. \n\n\nCement and Downstream Operations\n\n\nCement is the basic agent used to bind aggregates, sand and water in the production of ready mixed concrete.\u00a0\u00a0The Company has a strategic and leading cement position in Texas, with production facilities in Midlothian, Texas, south of Dallas/Fort Worth, and Hunter, Texas, north of San Antonio.\u00a0\u00a0These plants, which produce Portland and specialty cements, have a combined annual clinker capacity of 4.5 million tons, and operated at 76% utilization in 2021.\u00a0\u00a0The Midlothian plant permit allows the Company to expand production by up to 0.8 million additional tons.\u00a0\u00a0In 2021, as part of the Lehigh West Region acquisition, the Company acquired two cement production facilities, including one in Redding, California and one in Tehachapi, California, and several cement distribution terminals.\u00a0\u00a0These operations are classified as assets held for sale as of December 31, 2021.\u00a0\u00a0Calcium carbonate in the form of limestone is the principal raw material used in the production of cement.\u00a0\u00a0The Company owns more than 600 million tons of limestone reserves adjacent to its Texas cement production plants and more than 50 million tons of limestone reserves adjacent to its California cement production plants.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe cement operations of the Building Materials business produce Portland and specialty cements. Similar to aggregates, cement is used in infrastructure projects, nonresidential and residential construction, and the railroad, agricultural, utility and environmental industries. \nConsequently, the cement industry is cyclical and dependent on the strength of the construction sector.\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nCement consumption is dependent on the time of year and prevalent weather conditions. According to the Portland Cement Association, nearly two-thirds of U.S. cement consumption occurs in the six months between May and October.\u00a0\u00a0Approximately 70% to 75% of all cement shipments are sent to ready mixed concrete operators. The rest are shipped to manufacturers of concrete-related products, contractors, materials dealers and oil well/mining/drilling companies, as well as government entities.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n \nPage 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPart I\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n\u00a0\u00a0Item 1 \u2013 Business\n\n\nEnergy accounted for approximately 23% of the cement production cost profile in 2021. Therefore, profitability of cement is affected by changes in energy prices and the available supply of these products.\u00a0\u00a0The Company currently has fixed-price supply contracts for coal and natural gas, but also consumes alternative fuel and petroleum coke. Further, profitability of the cement operations is also \nimpacted by\n kiln maintenance, which typically requires a plant to be shut down for a period of time.\n\n\nThe limestone reserves used as a raw material for cement are located on Company-owned property, adjacent to each of the cement plants.\u00a0\u00a0Management believes that its reserves of limestone are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future.\n\n\nThe cement operations generally deliver their products upon receipt of customer orders or requests.\u00a0\u00a0Inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers\n.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nReady mixed concrete, a mixture primarily consisting of cement, aggregates, sand and water, is measured in cubic yards and specifically batched or produced for customers\u2019 construction projects and then transported and poured at the project site. The aggregates used for ready mixed concrete is a washed material with limited amounts of fines (such as dirt and clay). The Company operates 150 ready mix plants in Texas, Colorado, California, Arizona and Wyoming.\u00a0\u00a0The California ready mixed concrete operations are classified as assets held for sale as of December 31, 2021.\u00a0\u00a0Asphalt is most commonly used in surfacing roads and parking lots and consists of liquid asphalt, or bitumen, the binding medium, and aggregates. Similar to ready mixed concrete, each asphalt batch is produced to customer specifications. The Company operates 35 asphalt plants in Arizona, California, Colorado and Minnesota.\u00a0\u00a0The Company also provides paving services in Colorado and California.\u00a0\u00a0Market dynamics for these downstream product lines include a highly competitive environment and lower barriers to entry compared with aggregates and cement.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe cement and downstream operations results are affected by volatile factors, including energy-related costs, operating efficiencies and weather, to a greater extent than the Company\u2019s aggregates operations.\u00a0\u00a0Liquid asphalt and cement serve as key raw materials in the production of hot mix asphalt and ready mixed concrete, respectively.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, fluctuations in prices for these raw materials directly affect the Company\u2019s operating results. \n\n\nMagnesia Specialties Business\n\n\nThe Magnesia Specialties business produces and sells dolomitic lime from its Woodville, Ohio facility and manufactures magnesia-based chemical products for industrial, agricultural and environmental applications at its Manistee, Michigan facility.\u00a0\u00a0These magnesia-based chemical products have varying uses, including flame retardants, wastewater treatment, pulp and paper production and other environmental applications.\u00a0\u00a0In 2021, 69% of Magnesia Specialties\u2019 total revenues were attributable to chemical products, 30% to lime, and 1% to stone sold as construction materials.\n\n\nIn 2021, 76% of the lime produced in the Magnesia Specialties business was sold to third-party customers, while the remaining 24% was used internally as a raw material in making the business\u2019 chemical products.\u00a0\u00a0Dolomitic lime products sold to external customers are used primarily by the steel industry.\u00a0\u00a0In 2021, 34% of the Magnesia Specialties\u2019 total revenues were attributable to products used in the steel industry, primarily dolomitic lime.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nAccordingly, a portion of the revenues and profitability of the Magnesia Specialties business is affected by production and inventory trends in the steel industry.\u00a0\u00a0These trends are guided by the rate of consumer consumption, the flow of offshore imports, and other economic factors. The dolomitic lime business runs most profitably at 70% or greater steel capacity utilization.\u00a0\u00a0According to the Federal Reserve, domestic capacity utilization averaged 81% in 2021 versus 65% in 2020, which was negatively impacted by COVID-19.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIn the Magnesia Specialties business, a significant portion of costs is of a fixed or semi-fixed nature.\u00a0\u00a0The production process requires the use of natural gas, coal and petroleum coke.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, fluctuations in their pricing directly affect operating results.\u00a0\u00a0To help mitigate this risk, the Magnesia Specialties business has fixed-price agreements for approximately 64% of its 2022 coal, natural gas and petroleum coke needs.\u00a0\u00a0For 2021, the Company\u2019s average cost per MCF (thousand cubic feet) of natural gas increased 21% versus 2020.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nGiven high fixed costs, low capacity utilization can negatively affect the segment\u2019s results from operations. Management expects future organic profit growth to result from increased pricing, efficiency enhancements, rationalization of the current product portfolio and/or further cost reductions.\u00a0\u00a0Management has shifted the strategic focus of the magnesia-based business to specialty chemicals that can be produced at volume levels that support efficient operations.\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, these products are not as dependent on the steel industry as the dolomitic lime product line.\u00a0\u00a0Demand for chemicals products recovered in 2021 after being negatively impacted by COVID-19 in 2020.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n \nPage 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPart I\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n\u00a0\u00a0Item 1 \u2013 Business\n\n\nThe principal raw materials used in the Magnesia Specialties business are dolomitic limestone and magnesium-rich brine.\u00a0\u00a0Management believes that its reserves of dolomitic limestone and brine are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future.\n\n\nMagnesia Specialties generally delivers its products upon receipt of customer orders or requests. Inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers. A significant portion of the 275,000-ton dolomitic lime capacity from a lime kiln at Woodville, Ohio is committed under a long-term supply contract. \n\n\nThe Magnesia Specialties business is highly dependent on rail transportation, particularly for movement of dolomitic lime from Woodville to Manistee and direct customer shipments of dolomitic lime and magnesia chemicals products from both Woodville and Manistee. The segment can be affected by the specific transportation and other risks and uncertainties outlined under Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d of this Form 10-K. \n\n\nPatents and Trademarks\n\n\nAs of January 31, 2022, the Company owns, has the right to use, or has pending applications for patents pending or granted by the United States and various countries and trademarks related to its business. The Company believes that its rights under its existing patents, patent applications and trademarks are of value to its operations, but no one patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks is material to the conduct of the Company\u2019s business as a whole.\n\n\nCustomers\n\n\nNo material part of the business as a whole, or of any segment of the Company, is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few customers. The loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the segment. The Company\u2019s products are sold principally to commercial customers in private industry. Although large amounts of construction materials are used in public works projects, relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal, state, county, or municipal governments, or agencies thereof.\n\n\nCompetition\n\n\nThe nature of the Company\u2019s competition varies among its products due to the widely differing amounts of capital necessary to build and maintain production facilities. Crushed stone production from quarries or mines, and sand and gravel production by dredging, is moderately capital intensive. Construction of cement production facilities is highly capital intensive and requires long lead times to complete engineering design, obtain regulatory permits, acquire equipment and construct a plant. Most domestic cement producers are owned by large foreign companies operating in multiple international markets. Many of these producers maintain the capability to import cement from foreign production facilities. Ready mixed concrete production requires relatively small amounts of capital to build a concrete batching plant and acquire delivery trucks. Accordingly, economics can lead to lower barriers to entry in some concrete markets. As a result, depending on the local market, the Company may face competition from small producers as well as large, vertically-integrated companies with facilities in many markets. \n\n\nThe Company operates in a largely-fragmented industry with over 5,000 domestic aggregates producers, including large, public companies and a large number of small, privately-held companies.\u00a0\u00a0Other publicly traded companies among the ten largest U.S. aggregates producers include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nCemex S.A.B. de C.V.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nCRH plc \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nHeidelbergCement AG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nLafargeHolcim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nMDU Resources Group, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nSummit Materials, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nVulcan Materials Company\n\n\nDue to the localized nature of the industry resulting from the high cost of transportation relative to the price of the product, the Building Materials business primarily operates in smaller distinct areas that can vary from one another.\n\n\nCapacity for cement plants is often stated in terms of \u201cclinker\u201d capacity; clinker is the initial product of cement production. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, United States cement production is widely dispersed, with the top five companies collectively producing approximately 58% of U.S. clinker capacity. An estimated 83% of U.S. clinker capacity is owned by \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n \nPage 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPart I\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n\u00a0\u00a0Item 1 \u2013 Business\n\n\ncompanies headquartered outside of the United States. \nThe \nCompany\u2019s \ncement \noperations \nalso compete with imported cement because of the higher value of the product and the existence of major ports or terminals in Texas\n and California\n.\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations are also in markets with numerous operators, large and small. \n\n\nThe Company believes that its ability to transport materials by rail and waterborne vessels has enhanced its ability to compete in the building materials industry. \n\n\nThe Magnesia Specialties business competes with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of quality, price, technological advances, and technical support for its products. While the revenues of the Magnesia Specialties business in 2021 were predominantly domestic, \na portion was derived from customers located outside the United States.\n \n\n\nEnvironmental and Governmental Regulations \n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to and affected by federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to zoning, land use, mining, air emissions (including CO\n2\n and other greenhouse gases), water use, allocation and discharges, waste management, noise and dust exposure control, reclamation and other environmental, health and safety, and regulatory matters. Certain of the Company\u2019s operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous within the meaning of these laws and regulations. Environmental operating permits are, or may be, required for certain of the Company\u2019s operations, and such permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation.\n\n\nEnvironmental Compliance and Accruals\n\n\nThe Company regularly monitors and reviews its operations, procedures, and policies for compliance with existing laws and regulations, changes in interpretations of existing laws and enforcement policies, new laws that are adopted, and new laws that the Company anticipates will be adopted that could affect its operations. The Company has a full-time team of environmental engineers and managers that perform these responsibilities. The direct costs of ongoing environmental compliance were approximately $31.0 million in 2021 and $32.8 million in 2020 and are related to the Company\u2019s environmental staff, ongoing monitoring costs for various matters (including those matters disclosed in this Form 10-K), and asset retirement costs. Capitalized costs related to environmental control facilities were approximately $12.0 million in 2021 and are expected to be approximately $18.0 million in each of 2022 and 2023. The Company\u2019s capital expenditures for environmental matters were not material to its results of operations or financial condition in 2021 and 2020. However, the Company\u2019s expenditures for environmental matters generally have increased over time and are likely to increase in the future. Despite the Company\u2019s compliance efforts, risk of environmental liability is inherent in the Company\u2019s businesses, and environmental liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the Company in the future.\n Complying with governmental and environmental regulations did not have and is not expected to have a material effect on the Company\u2019s capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position, other than as discussed in this section.\n\n\nMany of the applicable requirements of environmental laws are satisfied by procedures that the Company adopts as best business practices in the ordinary course of its operations. For example, plant equipment that is used to crush aggregates products may, in the ordinary course of operations, have an attached water spray bar that is used to clean the stone. The water spray bar also serves as a dust control mechanism that complies with applicable environmental laws. Moreover, the Company does not separate the portion of the cost, depreciation, and other financial information relating to the water spray bar that is attributable only to environmental purposes, as such an allocation would be arbitrary. The incremental portion of such operating costs that is attributable to environmental compliance rather than best operating \npractices is impractical to quantify. Accordingly, the Company expenses costs in that category when incurred as operating expenses.\n\n\nAs is the case with others in the cement industry, the Company\u2019s cement operations produce varying quantities of cement kiln dust (CKD). This production by-product consists of fine-grained, solid, highly alkaline material removed from cement kiln exhaust gas by air pollution control devices. Since much of the CKD is unreacted raw materials, it is generally permissible to recycle the CKD back into the production process, and large amounts often are treated in such manner. CKD that is not returned to the production process or sold as a product itself is disposed in landfills. CKD is currently exempted from federal hazardous waste regulations under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n \nPage 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPart I\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n\u00a0\u00a0Item 1 \u2013 Business\n\n\nThe environmental accruals recorded by the Company are based on internal studies of the required remediation costs and estimates of potential costs that arise from time to time under federal, state and/or local environmental protection laws. Many of these laws and \ntheir attendant \nregulations are complex, and are subject to challenges and new interpretations by regulators and the courts. In addition, new laws are \nalso \nadopted from time to time. It is often difficult to accurately and fully quantify the costs to comply with new rules until it is determined to which type of operations they will apply and the manner in which they will be implemented is more accurately defined. This process \ntypically \ntakes years to finalize, and the rules often change significantly from the time they are proposed to the time they are final. The Company typically has several appropriate alternatives available to satisfy compliance requirements, which could range from nominal costs to some alternatives that may be satisfied in conjunction with equipment replacement or expansion that also benefits operating efficiencies or capacities and carry significantly higher costs.\n\n\nManagement believes that its current accrual for environmental costs is reasonable, although those amounts may increase or decrease depending on the impact of applicable rules as they are finalized or amended from time to time and changes in facts and circumstances.\u00a0\u00a0The Company believes that its operations and facilities, both owned or leased, are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations or financial condition. See \n\u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d\n under Item 3 of this Form 10-K, \n\u201cNote O: Commitments and Contingencies\u201d\n of the \n\u201cNotes to Financial Statements\u201d\n of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements included under \nItem 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplemental Data,\u201d\n of this Form 10-K, and the \n\u201cEnvironmental Regulation and Litigation\u201d\n \nsection included under \nItem 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d\n of this Form 10-K. However, future events, such as changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies\n, or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of certain products or business activities, may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\n \n\n\nMine Safety and Land Reclamation\n\n\nIn general, mining, production and distribution facilities for aggregates, cement, ready mixed concrete, and asphalt must comply with air quality, water quality, and other environmental regulations, zoning and special use permitting requirements, applicable mining regulations, and federal health and safety requirements. As the Company locates and acquires new production and distribution facilities, the Company works closely with local authorities during the zoning and permitting processes to design new quarries, mines, production and distribution facilities in such a way as to minimize disturbances. The Company frequently acquires large tracts of land so that quarry, mine, production and distribution facilities can be situated at a substantial distance from surrounding property owners. Also, in certain markets the Company\u2019s ability to transport material by rail and water allows it to locate its facilities further away from residential areas. The Company has established policies designed to minimize disturbances to surrounding property owners from its operations.\n\n\nAs is the case with other similarly situated companies, some of the Company\u2019s products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica, a common mineral also known as quartz. Excessive, prolonged inhalation of very small-sized particles of crystalline silica has been associated with lung diseases, including silicosis, and several scientific organizations and some states, such as California, have reported that crystalline silica can cause lung cancer. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) have established occupational thresholds for crystalline silica exposure as respirable dust. The Company monitors occupational exposures at its facilities and implements dust control procedures and/or makes available appropriate respiratory protective equipment to maintain the occupational exposures at or below the required levels. The Company, through safety information sheets and other means, also communicates appropriate warnings and cautions its employees and customers about the risks associated with excessive, prolonged inhalation of mineral dust in general and crystalline silica in particular. \n\n\nThe Company is generally required by state or local laws or pursuant to the terms of an applicable lease to reclaim quarry sites after use. Future reclamation costs are estimated using statutory reclamation requirements and management\u2019s experience and knowledge in the industry, and are discounted to their present value using a credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rate. The future reclamation costs are not offset by potential recoveries. For additional information regarding compliance with legal requirements, see \u201c\nNote O: Commitments and Contingencies\n\u201d of the \u201c\nNotes to Financial Statements\n\u201d of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements included in \nItem 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplemental Data,\u201d\n of this Form 10-K. The Company performs activities on an ongoing basis, as an integral part of the normal quarrying process, that may reduce the ultimate reclamation obligations. For example, the perimeter and interior walls of an open pit quarry are sloped and benched as they are developed to prevent erosion and provide stabilization. This sloping and benching meets both safety regulations required by MSHA for ongoing operations as well as final reclamation requirements. Therefore, these types of activities are included in normal operating costs and are not a part of the asset retirement obligation. \nHistorically, the \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n \nPage 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPart I\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n\u00a0\u00a0Item 1 \u2013 Business\n\n\nCompany has not incurred substantial reclamation costs in connection with the closing of quarries. Reclaimed quarry sites owned by the Company are from time to time available for sale, typically for commercial development or use as reservoirs\n, or have been converted for recreational use by the local community.\n\n\nGreenhouse Gases and Climate Change\n\n\nWe have identified certain risks and opportunities below with respect to the physical impacts of climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy. \n\n\nPolicy and Regulatory Matters\n \nA number of governmental bodies, including the U.S. Congress and various U.S. states, have proposed, enacted or are contemplating legislative and regulatory changes to mitigate or address the potential impacts of climate change, including provisions for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reporting or reductions, the use of alternative fuels, carbon credits (such as a \"cap and trade\" system) and a carbon tax. For example, in the United States, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) promulgated a rule mandating that sources considered to be large emitters of GHGs report those emissions. The manufacturing operations of the Company\u2019s Magnesia Specialties business release carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides during the production of lime, magnesium oxide and hydroxide products. The Company\u2019s two magnesia-based chemicals facilities, as well as its two cement plants in Texas and two newly-acquired cement plants in California, file annual reports of their GHG emissions in accordance with the USEPA reporting rule. The primary operations of the Company, however, including its aggregates, ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving product lines, are not so-called \u201cmajor\u201d sources of GHG emissions subject to the USEPA reporting rule. In fact, most of the GHG emissions from aggregates plant operations are tailpipe emissions from mobile sources, such as heavy construction and earth-moving equipment. \n\n\nIn 2010, the USEPA also issued a GHG emissions permitting rule, referred to as the \u201cTailoring Rule,\u201d which may require some industrial facilities to obtain permits for GHG emissions under the U.S. Clean Air Act\u2019s Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V operating permit programs. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June 2014 that the USEPA exceeded its statutory authority in issuing the Tailoring Rule but upheld the Best Available Control Technology (BACT) requirements for GHGs emitted by sources already subject to PSD or Title V permitting requirements for other pollutants. The Company\u2019s cement plants, as well as its Magnesia Specialties plants, hold Title V Permits, and each (other than the Redding, California cement plant and the Manistee, Michigan facility) is also subject to PSD requirements.\u00a0\u00a0With the change of the U.S. presidential administration in 2021, it is currently unclear whether the USEPA will proceed with revisions of the Tailoring Rule or proceed otherwise. It is also unknown how the USEPA may revise BACT requirements. In fact, although several large-scale projects for carbon capture are in the development phase, no technologies or methods of operation for reducing or capturing GHGs have yet been proven successful in large scale applications, other than improvements in fuel efficiency. Thus, if future modifications to our facilities require PSD review for other pollutants, GHG BACT requirements could be triggered and may require significant additional costs. However, it is currently impossible to estimate the cost of any such future requirements.\n\n\nU.S. President Biden also has taken a number of steps to make climate change a central focus of his administration, including issuing a pair of executive orders and a presidential memorandum making\u00a0\u00a0climate change central to U.S. policy and setting out several administrative priorities and undertakings. President Biden reentered the Paris Agreement in January 2021 and later announced the United States\u2019 reduction commitments under the Paris Agreement, including a 50% to 52% economy-wide reduction in net GHG emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. More recently, President Biden set out a pact with 103 countries and jurisdictions, known as the Global Methane Pledge, to reduce global methane emissions by 30% from 2020 levels by the end of the decade. In November 2021, President Biden signed into law the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (the \u201cIIJ Act\u201d), which provides billions of dollars in new funding for public transit and clean energy projects intended, in part, to address climate change, including road, bridge and other major infrastructure projects. In addition, the currently-proposed Build Back Better bill (the \u201cBBB bill\u201d) calls for significant U.S. government investments in the commercialization and scale-up of energy and climate technologies, as well as tax credits for businesses that invest in clean energy.\u00a0\u00a0Although it is still too early to determine the actions the federal government will ultimately take to implement these orders, commitments and laws, or the full scope, timing or ramifications of such measures, it is clear that the current administration intends and has already begun to make a significant and sweeping push on the climate front and, like other signatories to the Paris Agreement, intends to pursue a goal of a Net Zero GHG by 2050. These measures, combined with Democratic control of both chambers of the 117\nth\n U.S. Congress, also suggest that additional executive and/or legislative action is reasonably likely, although the timing and scope of such action is unclear. It also seems probable that the USEPA and other agencies will use their rule-making authority and procurement decisions to further address climate change. Various states where the Company has operations have enacted or are considering climate change initiatives as well, and the Company may be subject to state regulations in addition to any federal laws and rules that are passed.\n The Company\u2019s cement plants in California have not taken part in the auctions because the state previously allocated emission rights free of charge to the cement industry, which \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n \nPage 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPart I\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n\u00a0\u00a0Item 1 \u2013 Business\n\n\nhave been sufficient for operations to date. The Company will continue to monitor the cap-and-trade program closely as part of its production planning to assess the impact of potentially stricter requirements in the future and/or the need to purchase rights to emit GHGs in California.\n\n\nIf and when the USEPA issues new regulations and/or Congress passes additional legislation restricting GHGs emissions, the Woodville, Ohio and Manistee, Michigan Magnesia Specialties operations, as well as the Company\u2019s cement plants in Texas and California, which release CO\n2\n in certain of their processes and use carbon-based fuels for power equipment, kilns and the Company\u2019s mobile fleet, will likely be subject to any new requirements. The Company anticipates that any increased operating costs or taxes relating to GHG emission limitations at the Woodville or cement facilities would be passed on to customers. The magnesium oxide products produced at the Manistee operation, however, compete against other products that, due to the form and/or structure of the source material, require less energy in the calcination process, resulting in the generation of fewer GHGs per ton of production. Due to GHG emissions requirements, the Manistee facility may be required to absorb additional costs, including for taxes or capital investments in order to maintain competitive pricing in that market. In addition, the cement produced by the Company\u2019s cement plants, like other U.S. operators, is subject to strict limits set by the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) and other agencies, including those relating to \u201cclinker substitution\u201d, or the replacement of ground clinker in cement with alternate materials such as pozzolan, slag and fly ash, which has implications for the Company\u2019s fuel use and efforts to reduce GHG emissions from its cement operations.\u00a0\u00a0For example, various industry associations are engaged in an effort to ask the USDOT and other agencies to revise their standards allowing for greater rates of clinker substitution, similar to the rates currently permitted for European cement producers.\u00a0\u00a0If higher rates of substitution and blending are, in fact, permitted in the future, the result is likely to be both reduced clinker and power consumption in cement production, which would, in turn, reduce GHGs emitted in connection with each ton of cement produced in the United States.\n\n\nIn light of the various regulatory uncertainties, the Company at this time cannot reasonably predict what the costs of any future compliance requirements may be. Nonetheless, the Company does not believe it will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of either the Magnesia Specialties business or Building Materials business. The Company\u2019s four cement plants, like those of other cement operators, require combustion of significant amounts of fuel to generate high kiln temperatures and creates carbon dioxide as a product of the calcination process, which is an unavoidable step in making cement clinker.\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the Company continues to closely monitor GHG regulations and legislation and its potential impact on the Company\u2019s cement business, financial condition and product demand.\n \nThe Company does not currently expect the impact to the cement business to be material to the Company.\n\n\nPhysical Impacts \nIn addition to impacts from increased regulation, climate change may result in physical and financial impacts that could have adverse effects on the Company\u2019s operations or financial condition. Physical impacts may include disruptions in production and/or regional supply or product distribution networks due to major storm events, shifts in regional rainfall and temperature patterns and intensities, as well as flooding from sea level changes. In addition, production and shipment levels for the Building Materials business correlate with general construction activity, which occurs outdoors and, as a result, is affected by erratic weather patterns, seasonal changes and other unusual or unexpected weather-related conditions, which can significantly affect that business. Excessive rainfall and other severe weather jeopardize production, shipments and profitability in all markets served by the Company. In addition, climate and inclement weather can reduce the useful life of an asset. In particular, the Company\u2019s operations in the southeastern and Gulf Coast regions of the United States and The Bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity, most notably in August, September and October. The last few years brought an unprecedented amount of precipitation to the United States and particularly to Texas and the southeastern United States, notably the Carolinas, Florida and Georgia, where it impacted the Company\u2019s facilities. In California and Arizona, continuing drought has led to water use restrictions in numerous water districts, and insufficient supply of water for our operations in those areas could impact production.\n\n\nOther Transition Risks and Opportunities \nThe Company\u2019s businesses also are dependent on reliable sources of electricity and fuels. The Company could incur increased costs or disruptions in its operations if climate change regulation or severe weather impacts the price or availability of electricity or fuels or other materials used in its operations. These and other climate-related risks, such as a downturn in the construction sector due to harsh weather, high precipitation or other changes in weather, also could impact the Company\u2019s customers, which could lead to reduced demand for the Company\u2019s products. The Company may not be able to pass on to its customers all the costs relating to these risks.\n\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing risks and uncertainties relating to climate change, there may also be opportunities for the Company to increase its business or revenues, both in terms of the physical impacts of climate change and market opportunities associated with the transition to a low carbon economy. For example, warm and/or moderate temperatures in March and November allow the construction season to start earlier and end later, respectively, which could have meaningful positive impacts on the Company\u2019s first- and fourth-quarter results, respectively.\u00a0\u00a0From a regulatory standpoint, as noted \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n \nPage 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPart I\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n\u00a0\u00a0Item 1 \u2013 Business\n\n\nabove, \nthe recently-passed IIJ Act provides billions of dollars in new funding for roads, bridge and other major infrastructure projects. This may result in\n new public transit and clean energy projects\n that address climate change\n. \nIn addition, the Company\u2019s magnesium hydroxide products are used to increase fuel efficiency in various industries, including both coal- and gas-fired electricity generation, which has a direct impact on reducing energy use and GHG emissions by more GHG-intense companies. Finally, the desire for sustainable building solutions has led to greater recognition of the benefits of concrete construction in the effort to move to a circular economy thorough innovative products, longevity and recyclability, and increased demand for green construction projects would have a direct impact on the Company\u2019s cement and concrete business.\n\n\nOrganization and Governance\n \nThe Company\u2019s Board of Directors plays an essential role in determining strategic priorities and considers sustainability issues an integral part of its business oversight. The Company established an Ethics, Environment, Safety and Health (EESH) Committee in 1994, which today meets at least three times annually and receives reports directly from management relating to environmental, safety, ethics and other sustainability matters, including GHG and climate matters. The EESH Committee reports to the full Board, and number of other Board committees have overlapping responsibility for sustainability matters.\u00a0\u00a0Management receives at least quarterly updates from operating personnel directly responsible for compliance relating to EESH matters. The Company\u2019s sustainability function is led by a Head of Sustainability, who reports to the Executive Vice President and General Counsel on climate and other sustainability matters. The Company believes the above approach has been effective in integrating sustainability as a core element of its corporate governance\n.\n\n\nIn an effort to mitigate the risks to the Company associated with GHG emissions while ensuring and improving financial sustainability, the Company has adopted a corporate-wide management strategy that has resulted in multiple operating initiatives to implement or evaluate GHG reduction processes and technologies that also improve operational efficiencies, including: using alternative fuels such as biodiesel; reducing overall fuel use by converting from quarry trucks to conveyor belt systems; right-sizing quarry trucks to marry the appropriately sized truck with the size of production to reduce the number of required trips; replacing older railcars with more efficient, high-capacity models that reduce the number of required trips; adding rail capacity in lieu of truck movements; and installing state-of-the-art emissions control equipment at one of the Company\u2019s magnesia plants and tire processing systems for fuel, as well as a larger natural gas line, at one of the Company\u2019s cement plants. The Company\u2019s Midlothian cement plant has been recognized by the USEPA as a high-performing, energy-efficient facility following investments in innovative air pollution control technologies and usage of alternative fuels. \n\n\nLand Management\n\n\nThe Company owns approximately 170,000 acres of land, the vast majority of which is used in connection with active facilities. The Company regularly reviews its land holdings to determine their highest and best use based on its management expertise, and sell or develop for sale surplus property. Land holdings that do not have economically recoverable reserves for current or future mining or are otherwise not in locations that complement the Company\u2019s operating facilities are considered as candidates for sale. \n\n\nHuman Capital Resources\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAs of January 31, 2022, the Company has\n approximately 10,000 \nemployees, of which approximately 7,600 are hourly employees and approximately 2,400 are salaried employees. Approximately 1,400 hourly employees (14% of the Company\u2019s employees) are represented by labor unions, representing\n 19\n% of the Building Materials business\u2019 hourly employees and \n100\n% of the Magnesia Specialties segment\u2019s hourly employees. The Company\u2019s principal union contracts for the Magnesia Specialties business cover employees at the Manistee, Michigan, magnesia-based chemicals plant and the Woodville, Ohio, lime plant. The Woodville and Manistee collective bargaining agreements expire June 2022 and August 2027, respectively. The Company believes it has good relations with its employees, including its unionized workforce. While the Company\u2019s management does not expect material difficulties in renewing these labor contracts, there can be no assurance that a successor agreement will be reached at any of these locations. \n\n\nManagement believes the Company\u2019s success depends on its ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. None of Martin Marietta\u2019s accomplishments are possible without its employees; the people who both drive the work and are most affected by it. These individuals are the heart of Martin Marietta. The Company\u2019s management oversees various employee initiatives to foster and improve its employees and the Management Development and Compensation Committee regularly reviews the compensation program to achieve those objectives. In 2020, the Company also launched an Inclusion and Engagement Task Force, comprised of employees with diverse race, gender, background and experience, which is focused on hiring, developing, and retaining diverse employees to strengthen our talent pipeline and increase employee engagement and retention.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n \nPage 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPart I\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n\u00a0\u00a0Item 1 \u2013 Business\n\n\nHealth and safety in the workplace is one of the Company\u2019s core values. The Guardian Angel safety program provides that every employee has the right, and the obligation, to stop any unsafe condition and that zero safety incidents is achievable. It includes the concept that every employee \nacts\n as a wingman for other employees, to observe and act on any situation that potentially creates unsafe circumstances. The companywide safety performance, inclusive of \nits\n more recently acquired operations, \ndelivered\n better than world-class safety levels\n in 2021, the fifth consecutive year for the Company\u2019s lost-time incident rate\n.\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of keeping the Company\u2019s employees safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, the Company has taken actions aligned with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to implement robust protocols to protect its workforce so that they can safely perform their jobs.\n\n\nIn 2019, the Company established a new employer brand \u2014 \nONE\n \u2014 that reflects the thoughts, feelings and hearts of employees at every level of Martin Marietta. This included a standard approach to safety mentoring that ensures every employee has the knowledge and resources needed to complete their work safely and efficiently. The Company also established a World Class Task Force, whose mission is to improve Martin Marietta and is fostering a level of communication never before seen at the Company. In 2020, the Company launched an Inclusion and Engagement Steering Committee, comprised of diverse employees across the Company. The Company has taken these steps to better allow it to grow responsibly and encourage employee engagement.\n\n\nAvailable Information\n\n\nThe Company maintains an internet address at \nwww.martinmarietta.com\n.

Demand for our products, particularly in the private nonresidential and residential construction markets, could decline if companies and consumers are unable to obtain credit for construction projects or if an economic slowdown causes delays or cancellations of capital projects. State and federal budget issues may also hurt the funding available for infrastructure spending. The lack of available credit may limit the ability of states to issue bonds to finance construction projects. As a result of these issues, several of our top revenue-generating states, from time to time, stop bidding or slow bid projects in their transportation departments.\n\n\nWe sell most of our aggregates (our primary business) and our cement products to the construction industry and, therefore, our results depend on that industry\u2019s strength. Since our businesses depend on construction spending, which can be cyclical, our profits are sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions and the intensity of the underlying spending on aggregates and cement products. Construction spending is affected by economic conditions, changes in interest rates, demographic and population shifts, and changes in construction spending by federal, state and local governments. If economic conditions change, a recession in the construction industry may occur and affect the demand for our products. The recession of the late 2000s and early 2010s (the Great Recession) was an example, and our shipment volumes were significantly reduced.\u00a0\u00a0Construction spending can also be disrupted by terrorist activity and armed conflicts.\n\n\nWhile our business operations cover a wide geographic area, our earnings depend on the strength of the local economies in which we operate because of the high cost to transport our products relative to their selling price.\u00a0\u00a0If economic conditions and construction spending decline significantly in one or more areas, particularly in the Building Materials business\u2019 top five revenue-generating states of Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Minnesota, our profitability will decrease. We experienced this situation during the Great Recession.\n\n\nThe Great Recession resulted in large declines in shipments of aggregates products in our industry. Subsequent to the Great Recession and until the impact from COVID-19 beginning in the first quarter of 2020, we experienced slow-but-steady construction growth that coincided with the longest economic recovery in United States history.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWhile historical spending on public infrastructure projects has been, comparatively, more stable as governmental appropriations and expenditures are typically less interest rate-sensitive than private sector spending, we experienced a slight retraction in aggregates shipments to the infrastructure market after uncertainty regarding the passage of the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014. Contractors were not able to get any certainty on the availability of federal infrastructure funding until late 2015 with the enactment of the Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act.\u00a0\u00a0We expect that the passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (the IIJ Act) should provide funding visibility for the foreseeable future.\n\n\nOur Building Materials business is seasonal and subject to the weather, which can significantly impact operations\n\n\nSince the heavy-side construction business is conducted outdoors, erratic weather patterns, seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions affect our business. Adverse weather conditions, including hurricanes and tropical storms, cold weather, snow, heavy or sustained rainfall, wildfires and earthquakes, reduce construction activity, restrict the demand for our products and impede our ability to efficiently transport material. Adverse weather conditions also increase our costs and reduce our production output as a result of power loss, needed plant and equipment repairs, time required to remove water from flooded operations and similar events. Severe drought conditions can restrict available water supplies and restrict production. Production and shipment levels of the Building Materials business\u2019 products follow activity in the construction industry, which typically are strongest in the spring, summer and fall. Because of the weather\u2019s effect on the construction industry\u2019s activity, the production and shipment levels for the Company\u2019s Building Materials business, including all of its aggregates-related downstream operations, vary by quarter. The second and third quarters are generally subject to heavy precipitation, and thus are more profitable if precipitation is lighter, while the first and fourth quarters are subject to the impacts of winter weather, and thus are generally the least profitable and are more profitable if the impact of winter weather is less. The Company\u2019s operations in the southeastern and Gulf Coast regions of the United States and The Bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity, most notably in August, September and October.\u00a0\u00a0The Company\u2019s California operations are at risk for wildfire activity and water use restrictions given ongoing severe drought conditions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n \nPage 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPart I\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n\u00a0\u00a0Item 1A \u2013 Risk Factors\n\n\nOur\n businesses could be adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or any other outbreak of disease, epidemic or pandemic, or similar public health threat, or fear of such an event and its related economic and societal response\n\n\nOur businesses could be negatively impacted by the widespread outbreak of an illness or other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis that results in economic and trade disruptions. In or around December 2019, COVID-19 was initially reported. Four months later, in March 2020, the World Health Organization declared it a global pandemic. The proliferation of COVID-19 cases in the United States, and the extent that geography of outbreaks primarily matches the regions in which the Company\u2019s Building Materials business principally operates, can negatively impact economic activity, consumer confidence and discretionary spending, and overall market conditions. \n \nFurther, COVID-19 could continue to negatively affect the health of our employees, employee productivity, customer purchasing patterns and fulfillment of purchase orders, availability of supplies, pricing for raw materials, and the ability to transport materials via the Company\u2019s distribution network. While our operations have been designated as \u201cessential\u201d under applicable government orders otherwise restricting business activities to prevent further outbreak of COVID-19, and accordingly have been permitted to continue to operate, the Company continues to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter its business operations including any that may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that the Company determines are in the best interests of its employees, customers, suppliers, vendors, communities and other stakeholders.\u00a0\u00a0Demand for aggregates products, particularly in the infrastructure construction market, is affected by federal, state and local budget and deficit issues. Remote working trends are reducing miles driven, which can have a negative impact on various revenue streams that fund roadway projects. Further, delays or cancellations of projects in the nonresidential and residential construction markets, which combined accounted for 61% of aggregates shipments for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021, could occur if companies and consumers are unable to obtain financing for construction projects or if consumer confidence continues to be eroded by economic uncertainty. \n\n\nCompetition and Growth Risk Factors\n\n\nOur Building Materials business depends on the availability of quality aggregates reserves or deposits and our ability to mine them economically\n\n\nOur challenge is to find quality aggregates deposits that we can mine economically, with appropriate permits, near either growing markets or long-haul transportation corridors that economically serve applicable markets. As communities have grown, they have settled in and around attractive quarrying locations and have imposed restrictions on mining. We try to meet this challenge by identifying and permitting sites prior to economic expansion, buying more land around our existing quarries to increase our mineral reserves, developing underground mines and developing a distribution network that transports aggregates products by various methods, including rail and water. While our distribution network allows us to transport our products longer distances than would normally be considered economical, we can give no assurances that we will be successful at this strategy.\n\n\nOur businesses face many competitors\n\n\nOur businesses have many competitors, some of whom are bigger and have more resources than we do. Some of our competitors operate on a worldwide basis. Our results are affected by the number of competitors in a market, the production capacity that a particular market can accommodate, the pricing practices of other competitors and the entry of new competitors in a market. We also face competition for some of our products from alternative products. For example, our Magnesia Specialties business may compete with other chemical products that could be used instead of our magnesia-based products. As other examples, our aggregates, ready mixed concrete, and asphalt and paving businesses may compete with recycled asphalt and concrete products that could be used in certain applications instead of new products and our cement operations may compete with international competitors who are importing products into the United States from jurisdictions with lower production and regulatory costs.\n\n\nOur future growth may depend in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry, and we may acquire businesses by paying all or in part with shares of our common stock\n\n\nWe expect to continue to grow, in part, by acquiring other businesses. In the past, we have made acquisitions to strengthen our existing locations, expand our operations and enter new geographic markets. We will continue to pursue selective acquisitions, joint ventures or other business arrangements we believe will help our Company grow. However, the continued \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n \nPage 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPart I\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n\u00a0\u00a0Item 1A \u2013 Risk Factors\n\n\nsuccess of our acquisition program will depend on our ability to find and buy other attractive businesses at an appropriate price and our ability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations. We cannot assume there will continue to be attractive acquisition opportunities for sale at reasonable prices that we can successfully integrate into our operations.\n\n\nWe may decide to pay all or part of the purchase price of any future acquisition with shares of our common stock. We may also use our stock to make strategic investments in other companies to complement and expand our operations. If we use our common stock in this way, the ownership interests of our existing shareholders at that time will be diluted and the price of our stock could decline. We operate our businesses with the objective of maximizing long-term shareholder return.\n\n\nOur integration of the acquisition or business combination with other businesses may not be as successful as projected\n\n\nWe have a successful history of business combinations and integration of these businesses into our heritage operations. However, in connection with the integration of any other business that we acquire, there is a risk that we will not be able to achieve such integration in a successful manner or on the time schedule we have projected or in a way that will achieve the level of synergies, cost savings or operating efficiencies we forecast from the acquisition. \n\n\nAny other significant business acquisition or combination we might choose to undertake may require that we devote significant management attention and resources to preparing for and then integrating our business practices and operations. Based on our history, we believe we would be successful in this integration process. Nevertheless, we may fail to realize some of the anticipated benefits of any potential acquisition or other business combination that we pursue in the future if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected.

We can address capacity needs by enhancing our manufacturing productivity, increasing the operational availability of equipment, reducing machinery down time and extending machinery useful life. Future demand for our products may require us to expand our manufacturing capacity further, particularly through the purchase of additional manufacturing equipment. However, we may not be able to increase our capacity in time to satisfy increases in demand that may occur from time to time. Capacity constraints may prevent us from satisfying customer orders and result in a loss of sales to competitors that are not capacity-constrained. In addition, we may suffer excess capacity if we increase our capacity to meet actual or anticipated demand and that demand decreases or does not materialize. While we are permitted to expand production by up to 0.8 million additional tons at our Midlothian cement plant, it could take us a significant period of time before such production expansion could come to fruition. \n\n\nOur cement business could suffer if cement imports from other countries significantly increase or are sold in the United States in violation of U.S. fair trade laws\n\n\nIn the past, the cement industry has obtained antidumping orders imposing duties on imports of cement and clinker from other countries that violated U.S. fair trade laws. Currently, an antidumping order against cement and clinker from Japan is set to expire but is under review for extension by the Federal Trade Commission. As has always been the case, cement operators with import facilities can purchase cement from other countries, such as those in Latin America and Asia, which could compete with domestic producers. In addition, if environmental regulations increase the costs of domestic producers compared to foreign producers that are not subject to similar regulations, imported cement could achieve a significant cost advantage over domestically produced cement. An influx of cement or clinker products from countries not subject to antidumping orders, or sales of imported cement or clinker in violation of U.S. fair trade laws, could adversely affect our cement product line.\n\n\nEconomic, Political and Legal Risk Factors\n\n\nChanges in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning, land use, the environment, health and safety and other areas of the law, as well as litigation relating to these matters, affect our businesses. Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities\n\n\nMany federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to zoning, land use, air emissions (including carbon dioxide and other GHGs), water use, allocation and discharges, waste management, noise and dust control, mining, land reclamation and other environmental, health and safety matters govern our operations. Some of our operations require permits, which may impose additional operating standards, and are subject to modification, renewal and revocation. Certain of our operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous within the meaning of these laws and regulations. Despite our extensive efforts to remain in strict compliance at all times with all applicable laws and regulations, the risk of liabilities, particularly environmental liabilities, is inherent in the operation of our businesses. These potential liabilities could result in material costs, including fines or personal injury or damages claims, which could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability. \n\n\nFuture events, including changes in existing laws or regulations or enforcement policies, or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of some of our products or business activities may result in additional or unanticipated compliance and other costs. We could be required to invest in preventive or remedial action, like pollution control facilities, which could be substantial or which could result in restrictions on our operations or delays in obtaining required permits or other approvals.\n\n\nOur operations are subject to manufacturing, operating and handling risks associated with the products we produce and the products we use in our operations, including the related storage and transportation of raw materials, explosives, products, hazardous substances and wastes. We are exposed to hazards including storage tank leaks, explosions, discharges or releases of hazardous substances, exposure to dust, and the operation of mobile equipment and manufacturing machinery. \n\n\nThese risks can subject us to potentially significant liabilities relating to personal injury or death, or property damage, and may result in civil or criminal penalties, which could hurt our productivity or profitability. For example, from time to time we investigate and remediate environmental contamination relating to our prior or current operations, as well as operations we \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n \nPage 16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPart I\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n\u00a0\u00a0Item 1A \u2013 Risk Factors\n\n\nhave acquired from others, and in some cases we have been or could be named as a defendant in litigation brought by governmental agencies or private parties to investigate or clean-up such contamination.\n\n\nWe are involved from time to time in litigation and claims arising from our operations. While we do not believe the outcome of pending or threatened litigation \nwill have a material adverse effect on our operations or our \nfinancial condition\n, an\n \nunexpected and material adverse outcome in a pending or future legal action could potentially have a negative effect on our Company.\n\n\nClimate change and related legislation or regulations may adversely impact our business, including potential physical and financial impacts\n\n\nA number of governmental bodies, including the U.S. Congress and various U.S. states, have proposed, enacted or are contemplating legislative and regulatory changes to mitigate or address the potential impacts of climate change, including provisions for GHG emissions reductions or the use of alternative fuels, carbon credits (such as a \"cap and trade\" system) and a carbon tax. For example, in the United States, the USEPA promulgated a mandatory reporting rule covering GHG emissions from sources considered to be large emitters. The USEPA has also promulgated a GHG emissions permitting rule, referred to as the Tailoring Rule, which may require some industrial facilities to obtain operating permits for GHG emissions under the U.S. Clean Air Act. Although the U.S. Supreme Court subsequently ruled in June 2014 that the USEPA exceeded its statutory authority in issuing the Tailoring Rule but upheld the BACT requirements for GHGs emitted by sources that already require Title V operating permits or are subject to PSD requirements for other pollutants. With the change of the U.S. presidential administration in 2021, it is currently unclear whether the USEPA will proceed with revisions of the Tailoring Rule or proceed in a different direction, nor is it known how the USEPA may revise the BACT requirements. If future modifications to our Magnesia Specialties or cement facilities require PSD review for other pollutants, GHG permitting requirements may also be triggered, which could require us to incur significant additional costs. It is not possible, however, to estimate the cost of any future requirements at this time.\n\n\nU.S. President Biden also has taken a number of steps to make climate change a central focus of his administration, including issuing a pair of executive orders and a presidential memorandum making climate change central to U.S. Policy and setting out several administrative priorities and undertakings. President Biden reentered the Paris Agreement in January 2021 and later announced the United States\u2019 reduction commitments under the Paris Agreement, including a 50% to 52% economy-wide reduction in net GHG emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. More recently, President Biden set out a pact with 103 countries and jurisdictions, known as the Global Methane Pledge, to reduce global methane emissions by 30% from 2020 levels by the end of the decade. In November 2021, President signed into law the IIJ Act, which \nprovides billions of dollars in new funding for public transit and clean energy projects intended, in part, to address climate change, including road, bridge and other major infrastructure projects. In addition, the currently-proposed Build Back Better bill calls for significant U.S. government investments in the commercialization and scale-up of energy and climate technologies, as well as tax credits for businesses that invest in clean energy.\n\u00a0\u00a0Although it is still too early to determine the actions the federal government will ultimately take to implement these orders, commitments and laws, or the full scope, timing or ramifications of such measures, it is clear that the administration intends and has begun to make a significant and sweeping push on the climate front and, like other signatories to the Paris Agreement, intends to pursue a goal of a Net Zero GHG by 2050.\u00a0\u00a0These measures, combined with Democratic control of both chambers of the U.S. Congress, also suggest that additional executive and/or legislative action is likely, although the timing and scope of such action is unclear. Additionally, it seems probable that the USEPA and other agencies will use their rule-making authority and procurement decisions to further address climate change. Various states where we have operations have enacted or are considering climate change initiatives as well, and we may be subject to state regulations in addition to any federal laws and rules that are passed. For example, California has had a cap-and-trade program for emissions rights since 2012.\u00a0\u00a0In light of the various regulatory uncertainties, we cannot at this time reasonably predict what the costs of any future compliance requirements may be, but we do not believe it will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of either the Magnesia Specialties business or Building Materials business. We continue to monitor GHG regulations and legislation and its potential impact on our cement business, financial condition and product demand.\n\n\nAlthough our aggregates, ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations are not so-called \u201cmajor\u201d sources of GHG emissions subject to the USEPA reporting rule, any additional regulatory restrictions on emissions of GHGs imposed by the USEPA will likely impact our magnesia-based chemicals operations in Woodville, Ohio, and Manistee, Michigan, as well as our two cement plants in Texas and our two cement plants in California, each of which currently file annual reports of GHG emissions as required by the USEPA reporting rule. However, it is currently impossible to estimate the cost of any such future requirements at this time. In addition, we may not be able to recover any increased operating costs, taxes or capital investments (other than with respect to any carbon reduction or capture technologies) relating to GHG emission limitations at those plants from our customers in order to remain competitive in pricing in the relevant markets.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n \nPage 17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPart I\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n\u00a0\u00a0Item 1A \u2013 Risk Factors\n\n\nIn addition to impacts from increased GHG and other climate-related regulation, climate change may result in physical and financial impacts that could have adverse effects on our operations or financial condition. Given the nature of our operations, physical impacts may include disruptions in production and/or regional supply or product distribution networks due to major storm events, shifts in regional rainfall and temperature patterns and intensities, as well as flooding from sea level changes. In addition, production and shipment levels for the Building Materials \nb\nusiness \ncorrelate with general construction activity, most of which occurs outdoors and, as a result, is affected by erratic weather patterns, seasonal changes and other unusual or unexpected weather-related conditions, which can significantly affect that business. Excessive rainfall and other severe weather events also jeopardize production, shipments and profitability in all markets served by our operations. In particular, our operations in the southeastern and Gulf Coast regions of the United States and The Bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity, most notably in August, September and October. In addition, our California operations are at risk for wildfires, which is exacerbated by prolonged drought, which may also result in water restrictions. Increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events have been linked to climate change, and further global warming may increase the risk of adverse weather conditions.\u00a0\u00a0Climate and inclement weather can also reduce the useful life of an asset.\n\n\nOur businesses also are dependent on reliable sources of electricity and fuels. We could incur increased costs or disruptions in our operations if climate change legislation and regulation or severe weather impacts the price or availability of purchased electricity or fuels or other materials used in our operations. These and other climate-related risks, such as a downturn in the construction sector due to harsh weather, high precipitation or other changes in weather, could impact our customers, which could lead to reduced demand for our products. We may not be able to pass on to our customers all the costs related to mitigating these risks.\n\n\nThe overall impacts of climate change on our operations and the Company are highly uncertain and difficult to estimate. However, climate change legislation and regulation concerning GHGs could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n\nOur business is dependent on funding from a combination of federal, state and local sources\n\n\nOur products are used in public infrastructure projects, which include the construction, maintenance and improvement of highways, streets, roads, bridges, schools and similar projects. Accordingly, our business is dependent on the level of federal, state, and local spending on these projects. The visibility into future federal infrastructure funding was clarified and stabilized to some extent in 2015 with the passage of the Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation, or FAST Act, which reauthorized federal highway and transportation funding programs.\u00a0\u00a0Further clarification was provided with the passage of the $1 trillion IIJ Act in November 2021, which contains a five-year surface transportation reauthorization plus $110 billion in new funding for roads, bridges and other hard infrastructure projects.\u00a0\u00a0At the federal level, we expect to see stable infrastructure spending in 2022, with more meaningful impact from the IIJ Act beginning in 2023.\u00a0\u00a0Further, we continue to expect to see increased infrastructure spending at the state and local levels in 2022, aided by $10 billion for state departments of transportation provided by the December 2020 federal stimulus package as well as $14 billion of approved ballot initiatives.\n \nWe cannot be assured, however, of the amount and timing of appropriations for spending on infrastructure projects.\n\n\nOur businesses could be impacted by rising interest rates\n\n\nOur operations are highly dependent upon the interest rate-sensitive construction and steelmaking industries. Therefore, our business in these industries may decline if interest rates rise and costs increase. \n\n\nNotably, demand in the residential construction market in which we sell our aggregates products is affected by interest rates which are currently at historically low levels. There can be no assurance, however, that interest rates will not increase in the future, affecting our business in an adverse manner. The residential construction market accounted for 25% of our organic aggregates shipments in 2021. \n\n\nAside from these inherent risks from within our operations, our earnings are also affected by changes in short-term interest rates. However, rising interest rates are not necessarily predictive of weaker operating results. \n\n\nRising interest rates could also result in disruptions in the credit markets, which could affect our business, as described in greater detail under \u201c\nDisruptions in the credit markets could affect our business\u201d \nbelow.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n \nPage 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPart I\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n\u00a0\u00a0Item 1A \u2013 Risk Factors\n\n\nIncreases in our effective income tax rate may harm our results of operations\n\n\nA number of factors may increase our future effective income tax rate, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ngovernmental authorities increasing taxes or eliminating deductions, particularly the depletion deduction;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe mix of earnings from depletable versus non-depletable businesses;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe jurisdictions in which earnings are taxed;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nadjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nchanges in available tax credits;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nchanges in stock-based compensation;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nother changes in tax laws; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe interpretation of tax laws and/or administrative practices.\n\n\nAny significant increase in our future effective income tax rate could reduce net earnings and free cash flow for future periods. \n\n\nPersonnel Risks\n\n\nLabor disputes could disrupt operations of our businesses\n\n\nLabor unions represent approximately 14% of the hourly employees of our Building Materials business and all of the hourly employees of our Magnesia Specialties business. Our collective bargaining agreements for employees of our Magnesia Specialties business at the Woodville, Ohio, lime plant and the Manistee, Michigan magnesia chemicals plant expire in and June 2022 and August 2027, respectively. \n\n\nDisputes with our trade unions, or the inability to renew our labor agreements, could lead to strikes or other actions that could disrupt our businesses, raise costs and reduce revenues and earnings from the affected locations. \n\n\nWe depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel, and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect our business.\n\n\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continued services of, and on our ability to attract and retain, our key personnel and executive officers, including qualified management, technical, marketing and sales, and support personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining such qualified personnel, which could negatively affect our business. In addition, because of our reliance on our senior management team, the unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and develop or recruit talent to succeed our senior management and other key positions throughout the organization. If we fail to identify and develop or recruit successors, we are at risk of being harmed by the departures of these key employees. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.\n\n\nInvestment returns on our pension assets may be lower than expected, or interest rates may decline, requiring us to make significant additional cash contributions to our benefit plans.\n\n\nA portion of our current and former employees have accrued benefits under our defined benefit pension plans. Requirements for funding our pension plan liabilities are based on a number of actuarial assumptions, including the expected rate of return on our plan assets and the discount rate applied to our pension plan obligations. Fluctuations in equity market returns and changes in long-term interest rates could increase our costs under our defined benefit pension plans and may significantly affect future contribution requirements. It is unknown what the actual investment return on our pension assets will be in future years and what interest rates may be at any given point in time. We cannot therefore provide any assurance of what our actual pension plan costs will be in the future, or whether we will be required under applicable law to make future material plan contributions. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n \nPage 19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPart I\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n\u00a0\u00a0Item 1A \u2013 Risk Factors\n\n\nFinancial, Accounting and Cost Management Risk Factors\n\n\nOur business is a capital-intensive business\n\n\nThe property and machinery needed to produce our products are very expensive. Therefore, we require large amounts of cash to operate our businesses. We believe that our cash on hand, along with our projected operating cash flows and our available financing resources, is adequate to support our anticipated operating and capital needs. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow depends on future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash to operate our business, we may be required, among other things, to reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures.\n\n\nOur earnings are affected by the application of accounting standards and our critical accounting policies, which involve subjective judgments and estimates by our management. Our estimates and assumptions could be wrong\n\n\nThe accounting standards we use in preparing our financial statements are often complex and require that we make significant estimates and assumptions in interpreting and applying those standards. These estimates and assumptions involve matters that are inherently uncertain and require our subjective and complex judgments. If we used different estimates and assumptions or used different ways to determine these estimates, our financial results could differ.\n\n\nWhile we believe our estimates and assumptions are appropriate, we could be wrong. Accordingly, our financial results could be different, either higher or lower. We urge you to read the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section included under \nItem 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d\n of the Form 10-K.\n\n\nThe adoption of new accounting standards may affect our financial results\n\n\nThe accounting standards we apply in preparing our financial statements are reviewed by regulatory bodies and are periodically changed. New or revised accounting standards could, either positively or negatively, affect results reported for periods after adoption of the standards as compared to the prior periods, or require retrospective application changing results reported for prior periods. We urge you to read about our accounting policies in \nNote A\n: Accounting Policies\n of our Consolidated financial statements included under \nItem 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d\n of this Form 10-K. \n\n\nReports from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\u2019s (PCAOB) inspections of public accounting firms continue to outline findings and recommendations which could require these firms to perform additional work as part of their financial statement audits. Our costs to respond to these additional requirements may increase. \n\n\nImpairment charges could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial results\n\n\nGoodwill and other acquired intangible assets expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized, but must be evaluated for impairment by management at least annually. If the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, the goodwill is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a non-cash charge to earnings. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its fair value, the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a non-cash charge to earnings. Future events may occur that would adversely affect the fair value of our goodwill or other acquired intangible assets and require impairment charges. Such events may include, but are not limited to, lower than forecasted revenues, actual new construction and repair and remodel growth rates that fall below our assumptions, actions of key customers, increases in discount rates, continued economic uncertainty, higher levels of unemployment, weak consumer confidence, lower levels of discretionary consumer spending, a decrease in royalty rates and a decline in the trading price of our common stock. We continue to evaluate the impact of economic and other developments to assess whether impairment indicators are present. Accordingly, we may be required to perform impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors, and these tests could result in impairment charges in the future.\n\n\nDisruptions in the credit markets could affect our business\n\n\nWe have considered the current economic environment and its potential impact to our business. Demand for aggregates products, particularly in the infrastructure construction market, have historically been negatively affected by federal and state budget challenges and the uncertainty over future highway funding levels. Further, delays or cancellations to capital \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n \nPage 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPart I\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n\u00a0\u00a0Item 1A \u2013 Risk Factors\n\n\nprojects in the nonresidential and residential construction markets could occur if companies and consumers are unable to obtain financing for construction projects or if consumer confidence is eroded by economic uncertainty.\n\n\nA recessionary construction economy can also increase the likelihood we will not be able to collect on all of our accounts receivable with our customers. We are protected in part, however, by payment bonds posted by many of our customers or end-users as well as state lien rights. Nevertheless, we may experience a delay in payment from some of our customers during a construction downturn, which would negatively affect operating cash flows. Historically, our bad debt write-offs have not been significant to our operating results, and we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate.\n\n\nThe credit environment could impact our ability to borrow money in the future. Additional financing or refinancing might not be available and, if available, may not be at economically favorable terms. Further, an increase in leverage could lead to deterioration in our credit ratings. A reduction in our credit ratings, regardless of the cause, could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing and/or increase our cost of obtaining financing. There is no guarantee we will be able to access the capital markets at financially economical interest rates, which could negatively affect our business. \n\n\nWe may be required to obtain financing in order to fund certain strategic acquisitions, if they arise, or to refinance our outstanding debt. It is possible a large strategic acquisition would require that we issue new equity and debt securities in order to maintain our investment-grade credit rating and could result in a ratings downgrade notwithstanding our issuance of equity securities to fund the transaction. We are also exposed to risks from tightening credit markets, through the interest payable on any variable-rate debt, including the interest cost on future borrowings under our credit facilities. While management believes our credit ratings will remain at a composite investment-grade level, we cannot be assured these ratings will remain at those levels. Also, while we believe the Company will continue to have adequate credit available to meet its needs, there can be no assurance of that.\n\n\nOur Magnesia Specialties business faces currency risks from its overseas activities\n\n\nOur Magnesia Specialties business sells some of its products outside the United States. Therefore, the operations of the Magnesia Specialties business are affected from time to time by the fluctuating values of the currency exchange rates of the countries in which it does business in relation to the value of the U.S. Dollar. The business tries to mitigate the short-term effects of currency exchange rates by primarily denominating sales in the U.S. Dollar. This still leaves the business subject to certain risks, depending on the strength of the U.S. Dollar. \n\n\nUnexpected equipment failures, catastrophic events and scheduled maintenance may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns\n\n\nOur manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of equipment, such as our kilns and finishing mills. This equipment, on occasion, may be out of service as a result of planned maintenance, failures or damage during accidents. In addition to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosions or violent weather conditions. We have one- to two-week scheduled outages at least once a year to refurbish our cement and dolomitic lime production facilities. In 2021, the cement and Magnesia Specialties operations incurred shutdown costs of $23.6 million and $5.5 million, respectively. Any significant interruption in production capability may require us to make significant capital expenditures to remedy problems or damage as well as cause us to lose revenue due to lost production time.\n\n\nOur paving operations present additional risks to our business\n\n\nOur paving operations face challenges when our contracts have penalties for late completion. In some instances, including many of our fixed-price contracts, we guarantee project completion by a certain date. If we subsequently fail to complete the project as scheduled, we may be held responsible for costs resulting from the delay, generally in the form of contractually agreed-upon liquidated damages. Under these circumstances, the total project cost could exceed our original estimate, and we could experience a loss of profit or a loss on the project. In our paving operations, we also have fixed-price and fixed-unit-price contracts where our profits can be adversely affected by a number of factors beyond our control, which can cause our actual costs to materially exceed the costs estimated at the time of our original bid. These same issues and risks can also impact some of our contracts in our asphalt and ready mixed concrete operations. These risks are somewhat mitigated by the fact that a majority of our road paving contracts are projects that are short in duration. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n \nPage 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPart I\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n\u00a0\u00a0Item 1A \u2013 Risk Factors\n\n\nOur ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving product lines\n have lower profit margins and operating results can be more volatile\n\n\nOur ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations typically generate lower profit margins than our aggregates and cement operations due to potentially volatile input costs, highly competitive market dynamics, and lower barriers to entry. Therefore, if we expand these operations, our consolidated gross margin would likely be adversely affected. Our overall ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations\u2019 gross margin was 10.5% for 2021 and 10.9% for 2020.\n\n\nSuppliers, Raw Materials, and Energy Costs Risk Factors\n\n\nShort supplies and high costs of fuel, energy and raw materials affect our businesses\n\n\nOur businesses require a continued supply of diesel fuel, natural gas, coal, petroleum coke and other energy. The financial results of these businesses have historically been affected by the short supply or high costs of these fuels and energy. Changes in energy costs also affect the prices that we pay for related supplies, including explosives, conveyor belting and tires. While we can contract for some fuels and sources of energy, such as fixed-price supply contracts for coal and petroleum coke, significant increases in costs or reduced availability of these items have and may in the future reduce our financial results. Moreover, fluctuations in the supply and costs of these fuels and energy can make planning for our businesses more difficult. Because of the fluctuating trends in diesel fuel prices, we may enter into fixed-price fuel agreements from time to time for a portion of our diesel fuel to reduce our diesel fuel price risk.\n\n\nOur Magnesia Specialties business has fixed-price agreements for approximately 64% of its 2022 coal, natural gas, and petroleum coke needs. The cement operations have fixed-price agreements for a portion of their 2022 coal and natural gas needs.\n\n\nCement production requires large amounts of energy, including electricity and fossil fuels. Energy costs represented approximately 23% of the 2021 direct production costs of our cement operations. Therefore, the cost of energy is one of our largest expenses. Prices for energy are subject to market forces largely beyond our control and can be quite volatile. Price increases that we are unable to pass through in the form of price increases for our products, or disruption of the uninterrupted supply of fuel and electricity, could adversely affect us. Accordingly, volatility in energy costs can adversely affect the financial results of our cement operations. \n\n\nSimilarly, our ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations also require a continued supply of liquid asphalt and cement, which serve as key raw materials in the production of hot mix asphalt and ready mixed concrete, respectively. Some of these raw materials we produce internally, but most are purchased from third parties. These purchased raw materials are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuations, which are beyond our control. The financial results of our ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations have been affected by the short supply or high costs of these raw materials. We generally see frequent volatility in the costs for these raw materials. \n\n\nCement is sensitive to supply and price volatility\n\n\nCement competition is often based primarily on price, which is highly sensitive to changes in supply and demand. Prices may fluctuate significantly in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand, general economic conditions and other market conditions, which we cannot control. When cement producers increase production capacity or more cement is imported into the market, an oversupply of cement in the market may occur if supply exceeds demand. In that case, cement prices generally decline. We cannot be assured that prices for our cement products sold will not decline in the future or that such decline will not have a material adverse effect on our cement product line.\n\n\nOur Magnesia Specialties business depends in part on the steel industry and the supply of reasonably priced fuels\n\n\nOur Magnesia Specialties business sells some of its products to companies in the steel industry. While we have reduced this risk over the last few years, this business is still dependent, in part, on the strength of the cyclical steel industry. The Magnesia Specialties business also requires significant amounts of natural gas, coal and petroleum coke, and financial results are negatively affected by increases in fuel prices or shortages. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n \nPage 22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPart I\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n\u00a0\u00a0Item 1A \u2013 Risk Factors\n\n\nCyber and Information Security Risk Factors\n\n\nWe are dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive, proprietary and other types of information relating to its business operations, as well as confidential and sensitive information about its customers and employees maintained in the Company\u2019s computer systems and networks, certain products and services and in the computer systems and networks of its third-party vendors. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving as data thieves and hackers have become increasingly sophisticated and carry out direct large-scale, complex automated attacks against a company or through vendor software supply chain compromises. In particular, the Company is increasingly relying on its IT infrastructure to support its operations as it manages the impact of COVID-19, including supporting remote-work protocols in regions impacted by the spread of COVID-19, which can increase cyber risks. The Company is not able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any resulting material security breach or data loss. In addition, it is not always possible to deter misconduct by employees or third-party vendors.\n\n\nBreaches of the Company\u2019s technology systems, or those of the Company\u2019s vendors and customers, whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of service attacks or other cyber-attacks, hacking, \u201cphishing\u201d attacks, computer viruses, ransomware or malware, employee or insider error, malfeasance, social engineering, vendor software supply chain compromises, physical breaches or other actions, have and may result in manipulation or corruption of sensitive data, material interruptions or malfunctions in the Company\u2019s or such vendors\u2019 and customers\u2019 websites, applications, data processing and certain products and services, or disruption of other business operations. Furthermore, any such breaches could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information held by the Company (including information about the Company\u2019s business, employees or customers), as well as sensitive personally identifiable information, the disclosure of which could lead to identity theft. Breaches of the Company\u2019s products that rely on technology and internet connectivity can expose the Company to product and other liability risk and reputational harm. Measures that the Company takes to avoid, detect, mitigate or recover from material incidents, may be insufficient, circumvented, or may become ineffective.\n\n\nThe Company has invested and continues to invest in risk management and information security and data privacy measures in order to protect its systems and data, including employee training, organizational investments, incident response plans, table top exercises and technical defenses. The cost and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining and enhancing further data or system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly intense, complex and sophisticated global cyber threats. Despite the Company\u2019s best efforts, it is not fully insulated from data breaches and system disruptions. Recent well-publicized security breaches at other companies have led to enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cyber-attacks, and may in the future result in heightened cybersecurity requirements, including additional regulatory expectations for oversight of vendors and service providers. Any material breaches of cybersecurity, including the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data, or media reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to the Company\u2019s systems, products and services or those of the Company\u2019s third parties could cause the Company to experience reputational harm, loss of customers and revenue, fines, regulatory actions and scrutiny, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation, liability for failure to safeguard the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 information or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by the Company. The report, rumor or assumption regarding a potential breach may have similar results, even if no breach has been attempted or occurred. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\n\n\nThe Company is exposed to risks related to compliance with data privacy laws\n\n\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), which came into effect in January 2020, provides, among other things, a new private right of action for data breaches, requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, and provides consumers with additional rights. The California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act, which will become effective on January 1, 2023, amends and expands the CCPA, creating new industry requirements, consumer privacy rights and enforcement mechanisms. Similarly, to conduct certain of its operations, the Company moves data across national borders, and consequently is subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the United States and abroad regarding privacy, data protection and data security. The scope of the laws that may be applicable to the Company is often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws. For example, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n \nPage 23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPart I\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n\u00a0\u00a0Item 1A \u2013 Risk Factors\n\n\n(GDPR), which became effective in May 2018, greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of European Union law and added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data, including the public disclosure of significant data breaches. The Company's reputation and brand and its ability to attract new customers could also be adversely impacted if the Company fails, or is perceived to have failed, to properly respond to security breaches of its or third party\u2019s information technology systems. Such failure to properly respond could also result in similar exposure to liability.\n\n\nAll of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time. Privacy laws that may be implemented in the future will continue to require changes to certain business practices, thereby increasing costs, or may result in negative publicity, require significant management time and attention, and may subject the Company to remedies that may harm its business, including fines or demands or orders that the Company modify or cease existing business practices.\n\n\nOther Risk Factors\n\n\nDelays or interruptions in shipping products of our businesses could affect our operations\n\n\nTransportation logistics play an important role in allowing us to supply products to our customers, whether by truck, rail or water. We also rely heavily on third-party truck and rail transportation to ship coal, natural gas and other fuels to our plants. Any significant delays, disruptions or the non-availability of our transportation support system could negatively affect our operations. Transportation operations are subject to capacity constraints, high fuel costs and various hazards, including extreme weather conditions and slowdowns due to labor strikes and other work stoppages. In Texas, we compete for third-party trucking services with operations in the oil and gas fields, which can significantly constrain the availability of those services to us. If there are material changes in the availability or cost of transportation services, we may not be able to arrange alternative and timely means to transport our products or fuels at a reasonable cost, which could lead to interruptions or slowdowns in our businesses or increases in our costs.\n\n\nThe availability of railcars can also affect our ability to transport our products. Railcars can be used to transport many different types of products across all of our segments. If owners sell or lease railcars for use in other industries, we may not have enough railcars to transport our products. \n\n\nWe have long-term agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport our aggregates products from our Bahamas and Nova Scotia operations to various coastal ports. These contracts have varying expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2027 and generally contain renewal options. Our inability to renew these agreements or enter into new ones with other shipping companies could affect our ability to transport our products. \n\n\nSome of our products are distributed by barges along rivers in Ohio and West Virginia. We may experience, to a lesser degree, risks associated with distributing our products by barges, including significant delays, disruptions or the non-availability of our barge transportation system that could negatively affect our operations, water levels that could affect our ability to transport our products by barge, and barges that may not be available in quantities that we might need from time to time to support our operations.\u00a0\n\n\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws and North Carolina law may inhibit a change in control that you may favor\n\n\nOur restated articles of incorporation and restated bylaws and North Carolina law contain provisions that may delay, deter or inhibit a future acquisition of us not approved by our Board of Directors. This could occur even if our shareholders are offered an attractive value for their shares or if many or even a majority of our shareholders believe the takeover is in their best interest. These provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our Board of Directors in connection with the transaction.

Adjusted EBITDA\n\n\nEarnings from continuing operations before interest; income taxes; depreciation, depletion and amortization, the earnings/loss from nonconsolidated equity affiliates, acquisition-related expenses; and the impact of selling acquired inventory after its markup to fair value as part of acquisition accounting (Adjusted EBITDA) is an indicator used by the Company and investors to evaluate the Company\u2019s operating performance from period to period. Adjusted EBITDA is not defined by generally accepted accounting principles and, as such, should not be construed as an alternative to net earnings attributable to Martin Marietta, earnings from operations or operating cash flow. However, the Company\u2019s management believes that Adjusted EBITDA may provide additional information with respect to the Company\u2019s performance. Since Adjusted EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net earnings and may vary among companies, Adjusted EBITDA as presented by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\n\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Martin Marietta to consolidated Adjusted

is primarily attributable to increased pricing, favorable weather conditions that extended 2021 construction activity and the accretive impacts of acquisitions, partially offset by higher energy and

The increase in gross profit in Magnesia Specialties is driven by robust domestic and global demand, partially offset by higher energy, raw material and contract services costs.\n\n\nCorporate gross profit includes intercompany royalty and rental revenue and expenses, depreciation and unallocated operational expenses excluded from the Company\u2019s evaluation of business segment performance. \n\n\nAggregates. \nThe average selling price per ton for aggregates was $15.08 and $14.77 for 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n\nAggregates average selling price increases compared to the prior year are as follows: \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyears ended December 31\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEast Group\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n1.6%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3.8%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWest Group\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3.1%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n1.7%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal aggregates operations\n1\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2.1%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3.1%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganic aggregates operations\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2.9%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3.1%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\nTotal aggregates operations include acquisitions from the date of acquisition and divestitures through the date of disposal.\n\n\nAggregates pricing improved 2.1%, or 2.7% on a mix-adjusted basis, compared with 2020. The East Group reported a modest increase of 1.6% resulting from more shipments of lower-priced base stone as well as the acquired Tiller operations having selling prices lower than the company average. West Group pricing increased 3.1%, or 2.6% on a mix-adjusted basis, compared with 2020, reflecting more long-haul shipments from higher-priced distribution yards. \n\n\nThe following presents

mix-adjusted basis, compared with the prior year, reflecting favorable Texas market dynamics. Cement product gross margin declined 600 basis points as higher energy, maintenance and raw materials costs outpaced shipment and pricing gains.\n\n\nReady mixed concrete pricing improved 1.4% and shipment volume increased 18.8% in 2021, reflecting robust demand in Texas and contributions from the Lehigh West Region operations. In 2021, asphalt pricing increased 4.1% and volumes improved 113.3%, attributable to shipments from the acquired Tiller and Lehigh West Region operations, offset by weather-impeded shipments for the majority of the year and liquid supply disruptions in Colorado.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n \nPage 54\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPart II\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n\u00a0\u00a0Item 7 \u2013 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n\nMagnesia Specialties.\n \nIn \n2021\n, \nMagnesia Specialties \nreported \ntotal revenues of $\n298.7\n million, gross profit of $\n106.5\n million\n \nand earnings from operations of $\n9\n0.\n8\n \nmillion\n, \nrepresenting\n in\ncreases of \n23\n%, \n2\n4\n% and \n28\n%,\n \nrespectively, compared with \n2020\n. \nThe \nincrease in 2021 compared \nwith\n prior year is reflective of \nstrong\n domestic and global demand for \nchemical and lime products which rebounded from 2020 COVID-impacted levels\n.\n\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses \n\n\nSG&A expenses for 2021 and 2020 were 6.5% of total revenues. The $45.1 million increase in total expense is primarily driven by incremental SG&A related to acquired operations, higher stock compensation expense and the impacts of higher salary costs.\n\n\nAcquisition-Related Expenses\n\n\nAcquisition-related expenses of $57.9 million were incurred in 2021, primarily associated with the Tiller and Lehigh West Region acquisitions.\n\n\nOther Operating Income, Net \n\n\nOther operating income, net, is comprised generally of gains and losses on the sale of assets; recoveries and losses related to certain customer accounts receivable; rental, royalty and services income; accretion expense, depreciation expense and gains and losses related to asset retirement obligations. These net amounts represented income of $34.3 million in 2021 and $59.8 million in 2020. For 2021, other operating income, net included $21.6 million of nonrecurring gains on land sales and divested assets driven primarily by the sale of the Company\u2019s former corporate headquarters land and buildings. The 2020 amount included $69.9 million of nonrecurring gains on the sales of investment land and divested assets in Austin, Texas; Riverside, California; and Augusta, Kansas. These gains were recorded in the West Group.  These asset sales collectively generated net cash proceeds of $122.8 million. \n\n\nEarnings from Operations \n\n\nConsolidated earnings from operations were $973.8 million and $1.01 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n\n\nInterest Expense \n\n\nInterest expense was $142.7 million in 2021 and $118.1 million in 2020. The increase reflected higher average outstanding debt during 2021 compared with 2020, as the Company issued $2.5 billion of publicly traded debt in July 2021 to help finance acquisition activity.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOther Nonoperating (Income) and Expenses, Net \n\n\nOther nonoperating (income) and expenses, net, is comprised generally of interest income; foreign currency transaction gains and losses; pension and postretirement benefit cost (excluding service cost); net equity earnings from nonconsolidated investments and other miscellaneous income and expenses. Consolidated other nonoperating income and expenses, net, was income of $24.4 million in 2021 and income of $2.0 million in 2020. The 2021 amount \nreflected a $19.4 million reduction in pension expense compared with 2020.\u00a0\u00a0The Company financed $7.7 million and $11.4 million of third-party railroad track maintenance expense in 2021 and 2020, respectively\n.\n\n\nIncome Tax Expense \n\n\nVariances in the estimated effective income tax rates, when compared with the statutory corporate income tax rate, are due primarily to the statutory depletion deduction for mineral reserves, the effect of state income taxes, stock compensation deductions, and the impact of foreign income or losses for which no tax expense or benefit is recognized. Additionally, certain acquisition-related expenses have limited deductibility for income tax purposes.\n\n\nThe permanent benefit associated with the statutory depletion deduction for mineral reserves is typically the significant driver of the estimated effective income tax rate. The statutory depletion deduction is calculated as a percentage of revenues subject to certain limitations. Due to these limitations, changes in sales volumes and pretax earnings may not proportionately affect the statutory depletion deduction and the corresponding impact on the effective income tax rate. However, the impact \nof the depletion deduction on the estimated effective tax rate is inversely affected by increases or decreases in pretax earnings.\n \n\n\nThe Company\u2019s estimated effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was 17.9% and 18.9%, respectively.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n \nPage 55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPart II\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n\u00a0\u00a0Item 7 \u2013 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n\nThe effective income tax rate\ns\n for\n 2021 and\n 2020 \nincluded\n a \n$9.7 million and a \n$14.2 million discrete benefit\n, respectively,\n from financing third-party railroad track maintenance.\u00a0\u00a0In exchange, the Company received a federal income tax credit and deduction.\n\n\nDiscontinued Operations\n\n\nThe Company classified the cement and California ready mixed concrete businesses acquired as part of Lehigh West Region as assets held for sale and discontinued operations for 2021.\u00a0\u00a0The collective businesses generated income of $0.5 million, net of expenses associated with the planned disposal, the impact of selling acquired inventory after its step up to fair value as part of acquisition accounting and income tax expense.\n\n\nNet Earnings Attributable to Martin Marietta and Earnings Per Diluted Share \n\n\nNet earnings from continuing operations attributable to Martin Marietta were $702.0 million, or $11.22 per diluted share, for 2021 and $721.0 million, or $11.54 per diluted share, for 2020. \n\n\nLiquidity and Cash Flows \n\n\nOperating Activities \n\n\nGenerally, the Company\u2019s primary source of liquidity is cash generated from operating activities. Operating cash flow is substantially derived from consolidated net earnings, before deducting depreciation, depletion and amortization, and offset by working capital requirements. Cash provided by operations was $1.14 billion in 2021 and $1.05 billion in 2020. The primary driver of the increase in cash provided by operations in 2021 was higher earnings before noncash gains and expenses.\n\n\n\n\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization expense were as follows: \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyears ended December 31\n\n\n(in millions)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepreciation\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n362.2\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n336.8\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepletion\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n46.0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n35.9\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmortization\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n38.3\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n17.0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n446.5\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n389.7\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n \nPage 56\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPart II\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n\u00a0\u00a0Item 7 \u2013 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInvesting Activities \n\n\nNet cash used for investing activities was $3.47 billion in 2021 and $409.7 million in 2020.

Total cash dividends paid were $147.8 million in 2021 and $140.3 million in 2020. \n\n\nIn 2020, the Company repurchased 0.2 million shares of its common stock for a total cost of $50.0 million, or $237.40 per share. \n\n\nCapital Structure and Resources \n\n\nLong-term debt, including current maturities, was $5.10 billion at December\u00a031, 2021, and was predominantly in the form of publicly-issued long-term notes and debentures. \n\n\nOn July 2, 2021, the Company issued $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.650% Senior Notes due 2023 (the 0.650% Senior Notes), $900.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.400% Senior Notes due 2031 (the 2.400% Senior Notes) and $900.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.200% Senior Notes due 2051 (the 3.200% Senior Notes), pursuant to a base indenture, dated as of May 22, 2017 (the Base Indenture), as amended and supplemented from time to time, including by the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of July 2, 2021 and, together with the Base Indenture (the Indenture) between the Company and Regions Bank, as trustee, governing these notes. On the consolidated balance sheets, these notes are carried net of original issue discount, which will be amortized using the effective interest method over the lives of the issues. The Company used the net proceeds of the 2.400% Senior Notes, the 3.200% Senior Notes and the 0.650% Senior Notes to pay the consideration for the acquisition of the Lehigh West Region business, and for general corporate purposes. See Note D to the financial statements for more information on the Lehigh West Region acquisition, which was consummated on October 1, 2021.\n\n\nOn March 5, 2020, the Company issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.500% Senior Notes due 2030 (the 2.500% Senior Notes). The 2.500% Senior Notes are carried net of original issue discount, which is being amortized by the effective interest method over the life of the issue. The 2.500% Senior Notes are redeemable prior to December 15, 2029 at their make-whole redemption price at a discount rate of the U.S. Treasury Rate plus 30 basis points, or on or after December 15, 2029 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.

The Company manages its cash and cash equivalents to ensure short-term operating cash needs are met and excess funds are managed efficiently. The Company funds shortages in operating cash through credit facilities. The Company utilizes excess cash to either pay-down credit facility borrowings or invest in money market funds, money market demand deposit accounts or offshore time deposit accounts. Money market demand deposits and offshore time deposit accounts are exposed to bank solvency risk. Money market demand deposit accounts are FDIC insured up to $250,000. The Company\u2019s investments in bank funds generally exceed the FDIC insurance limit. \n\n\nCash on hand, along with the Company\u2019s projected internal cash flows and availability of financing resources, including its access to debt and equity capital markets, is expected to continue to be sufficient to provide the capital resources necessary to support anticipated operating needs, cover debt service requirements, meet capital expenditures and discretionary investment needs, fund certain acquisition opportunities that may arise and allow for payment of dividends for the foreseeable future. Borrowings under the Revolving Facility are unsecured and may be used for general corporate purposes. The Company\u2019s ability to borrow or issue securities is dependent upon, among other things, prevailing economic, financial and market conditions. At December\u00a031, 2021, the Company had $1.20 billion of unused borrowing capacity under its Revolving Facility and Trade Receivable Facility. \n\n\nThe Company may be required to obtain additional financing in order to fund certain strategic acquisitions or to refinance outstanding debt. Any strategic acquisition of size would likely require an appropriate balance of newly-issued equity with debt in order to maintain a composite investment-grade credit rating.\u00a0\u00a0The Company is exposed to credit markets through the interest cost related to borrowings under its Revolving Facility and Trade Receivable Facility. \n\n\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was signed into law in March 2020 and provides liquidity support for businesses.\u00a0\u00a0The CARES Act allowed the Company to defer the payment of the 6.2% employer share of Social Security taxes for the period from March 27, 2020 through December 31, 2020.\u00a0\u00a0The Company deferred payment of $27.6 million under this provision.\u00a0\u00a0Half of the deferred obligation was paid December 31, 2021 and the remaining half is due December 31, 2022.\u00a0\u00a0There will be no interest assessed on amounts deferred.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nContractual and Off Balance Sheet Obligations \n\n\nPostretirement medical benefits will be paid from the Company\u2019s assets. The obligation, if any, for retiree medical payments is subject to the terms of the plan. At December\u00a031, 2021, the Company\u2019s recorded benefit obligation related to these benefits totaled $11.4 million. \n\n\nThe Company has other retirement benefits related to pension plans. At December\u00a031, 2021, the fair value of the qualified pension plans\u2019 assets exceeded the projected benefit obligation by $179.0 million. The Company estimates that it will make contributions of $75.0 million to qualified pension plans in 2022. Any contributions beyond 2022 are currently undeterminable and will depend on the investment return on the related pension assets. However, management\u2019s practice is to fund at least the service cost annually. At December\u00a031, 2021, the Company had a total obligation of $114.2 million related to unfunded nonqualified pension plans and expects to make contributions of $18.5 million to these plans in 2022. \n\n\nAt December\u00a031, 2021, the Company had $5.6 million accrued for uncertain tax positions, including interest of $0.2 million. Such liabilities may become payable if the tax positions are not sustained upon examination by a taxing authority.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIn connection with normal, ongoing operations, the Company enters into market-rate leases for property, plant and equipment and royalty commitments principally associated with leased land and mineral reserves. Additionally, the Company \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n \nPage 58\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPart II\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n\u00a0\u00a0Item 7 \u2013 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n\nenters into equipment rentals to meet shorter-term, nonrecurring and intermittent needs. At \nDecember\u00a031, 20\n2\n1\n, the Company had \n$\n433.\n3\n million in operating lease obligations and \n$\n204.4\n million in \nfinance\n lease obligations\n, representing the present value of future payments\n.\u00a0\u00a0The Company also had $29.5 million of lease obligations classified as held for sale\n. \nThe imputed interest on operating and finance lease obligations was $\n202.6\n million. \nManagement anticipates that, in the ordinary course of business, the Company will enter into additional royalty agreements for land and mineral reserves during \n202\n2\n. \nAs permitted, short-term leases are excluded from ASC 842 requirements\n and\n future noncancelable obligations for these leases as of December 31, 20\n2\n1\n are immaterial\n. \n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, future interest payable on the Company\u2019s publicly traded debt through the various maturity dates was $2.31 billion.\u00a0\u00a0The Company had obligations related to contracts of affreightment not accounted for as a lease and royalty agreements totaling $162.5 million and $145.9 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2021. The Company had purchase commitments for property, plant and equipment of $101.7 million as of December 31, 2021. The Company also had other purchase obligations related to energy and service contracts which totaled $194.7 million as of December\u00a031, 2021.\n\n\nContingent Liabilities and Commitments \n\n\nThe Company has entered into standby letter of credit agreements relating to certain insurance claims, contract performance and permit requirements. At December\u00a031, 2021, the Company had contingent liabilities guaranteeing its own performance under these outstanding letters of credit of $17.2 million. \n\n\nIn the normal course of business, at December\u00a031, 2021, the Company was contingently liable for $419.7 million in surety bonds, which guarantee its own performance and are required by certain states and municipalities and their related agencies. The Company has indemnified the underwriting insurance companies against any exposure under the surety bonds. In the Company\u2019s past experience, no material claims have been made against these financial instruments. \n\n\nThe Company is a co-borrower with an unconsolidated affiliate for a $12.5 million revolving line of credit agreement with Truist Bank. The affiliate has agreed to reimburse and indemnify the Company for any payments and expenses the Company may incur from this agreement. The Company holds a lien on the affiliate\u2019s membership interest in a joint venture as collateral for payment under the revolving line of credit. \n\n\nOther Financial Information\n \n\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\n\nThe Company\u2019s audited consolidated financial statements include certain critical estimates regarding the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates require management\u2019s subjective and complex judgments. Amounts reported in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements could differ materially if management used different assumptions in making these estimates, resulting in actual results differing from those estimates. Methodologies used and assumptions selected by management in making these estimates, as well as the related disclosures, have been reviewed by and discussed with the Company\u2019s Audit Committee. Management\u2019s determination of the critical nature of accounting estimates and judgments may change from time to time depending on facts and circumstances that management cannot currently predict. \n\n\nImpairment Review of Goodwill \n\n\nGoodwill is required to be tested annually for impairment. An interim review is performed between annual tests if facts and circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The impairment review of goodwill is a critical accounting estimate because goodwill represented 24% (excluding goodwill allocated to assets held for sale) of the Company\u2019s total assets at December\u00a031, 2021; the review requires management to apply judgment and make key assumptions; and an impairment charge could be material to the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. The Company performs its impairment evaluation as of October 1, which represents the annual evaluation date.\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s reporting units, which represent the level at which goodwill is tested for impairment, are based on the operating segments of the Building Materials business. The Southwest Division is the most significant reporting unit and includes $1.7 billion of the Company\u2019s goodwill. There is no goodwill related to the Magnesia Specialties business. \n\n\nCertain of the aforementioned reporting units within the Building Materials business meet the aggregation criteria and are consolidated into reportable segments for financial reporting.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nGoodwill is assigned to the respective reporting unit(s) based on the location of acquisitions at the time of consummation. If subsequent organizational changes result in operations being transferred to a different reporting unit, a proportionate amount of goodwill is transferred from the former to the new reporting unit. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n \nPage 59\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPart II\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n\u00a0\u00a0Item 7 \u2013 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n\nthe reporting unit\u2019s fair value to its carrying value, which represents a Step-1 analysis. However, prior to Step 1, the Company may perform an optional qualitative assessment\n, or Step 0\n. As part of the qualitative assessment, the Company considers, among other things, the following events and circumstances: macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance and other business or reporting unit-specific events. If the Company concludes it is more-likely-than-not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50%) that a reporting unit\u2019s fair value is higher than its carrying value, the Company does not perform any further goodwill impairment testing for that reporting unit. Otherwise, it proceeds to Step 1 of its goodwill impairment analysis. The Company may bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly with the quantitative calculation in Step 1. When the Company validates its conclusion by measuring fair value, it may resume performing a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit in any subsequent period. If the reporting unit\u2019s fair value exceeds its carrying value, no further calculation is necessary. A reporting unit with a carrying value in excess of its fair value constitutes a Step\n-\n1 failure and \nresults in an \nimpairment charge.\n\n\nFor the 2021 annual impairment evaluation, the Company performed a Step-0 analysis for all reporting units and concluded that it is more-likely-than-not that the reporting units\u2019 fair values exceed their carrying values. \n\n\nAny potential impairment charges from future evaluations represent a risk to the Company.\n\n\nPension Benefit Obligation and Pension Expense \u2013 Selection of Assumptions \n\n\nThe Company sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all employees and a Supplemental Excess Retirement Plan (SERP) for certain retirees (see Note K to the consolidated financial statements). Annually, as of December 31, management remeasures the defined benefit pension plans\u2019 projected benefit obligation based on the present value of the projected future benefit payments to all participants for services rendered to date, reflecting \nexpected future pay increases through the participants\u2019 expected retirement dates. A discount rate assumption is selected annually based on corporate bond rates as of the measurement date to calculate the present value of the projected benefit obligation.\n\n\nAnnual pension expense, referred to as net periodic benefit cost within the consolidated financial statements, (inclusive of SERP expense) consists of several components:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nService Cost, \nwhich represents the present value of benefits attributed to services rendered in the current year, measured by expected future salary levels to assumed retirement dates;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nInterest Cost, \nwhich represents one year\u2019s additional interest on the projected benefit obligation;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nExpected Return on Assets, \nwhich represents the expected investment return on pension plan assets; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nAmortization of Prior Service Cost and Actuarial Gains and Losses, \nwhich\n \nrepresents components that are recognized over time rather than immediately. Prior service cost represents credit given to employees for years of service already accrued, of which there is an insignificant amount at December\u00a031, 2021. Actuarial gains and losses arise from changes in assumptions regarding future events, a change in the benefit obligation resulting from experience different from assumed or when actual returns on pension assets differ from expected returns. At December\u00a031, 2021, the unrecognized actuarial loss was $166.2 million. Pension accounting rules currently allow companies to amortize the portion of the unrecognized actuarial loss that represents more than 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or pension plan assets, using the average remaining service life for the amortization period. Therefore, the $166.2 million unrecognized actuarial loss consisted of $46.2 million currently subject to amortization in 2022 and $120.0 million not subject to amortization in 2022. \n\n\nThese components are calculated annually to determine the annual pension expense. \n\n\nManagement believes the selection of assumptions related to the annual pension expense and related projected benefit obligation is a critical accounting estimate due to the high degree of volatility in the expense and obligation dependent on selected assumptions. The key assumptions are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nThe \ndiscount rate\n is used to present value the projected benefit obligation and represents the current rate at which the projected benefit obligations could be effectively settled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nThe \nexpected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets\n is used to estimate future asset returns and should reflect the average rate of long-term earnings on assets invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nThe \nmortality table \nand \nmortality improvement scale \nrepresent published statistics on the expected lives of people\n.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n \nPage 60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPart II\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n\u00a0\u00a0Item 7 \u2013 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nThe \nrate of increase in future compensation levels\n is used to project the pay-related pension benefit formula and should estimate actual future compensation levels.\n\n\nManagement\u2019s selection of the discount rate is based on an analysis that estimates the current rate of return for high-quality, fixed-income investments with maturities matching the payment of pension benefits that could be purchased to settle the obligations. The Company selected a hypothetical portfolio of Moody\u2019s Aa bonds, \nwith maturities that match the benefit obligations,\n to determine the discount rate. At December\u00a031, 2021, the Company selected a discount rate assumption of 3.23%, a 7-basis-point increase compared with the prior-year assumption. Of the four key assumptions, the discount rate is generally the most volatile and sensitive estimate. Accordingly, a change in this assumption has the most significant impact on the annual pension expense and the projected benefit obligation. \n\n\nManagement\u2019s selection of the rate of increase in future compensation levels, which reflects cost of living adjustments and merit and promotion increases, is generally based on the Company\u2019s historical increases in pensionable earnings, while giving consideration to any future expectations. A higher rate of increase results in higher pension expense and a higher projected benefit obligation. The assumed long-term rate of increase is 4.5%.\n\n\nManagement\u2019s selection of the expected long-term rate of return on pension fund assets is based on a building-block approach, whereby the components are weighted based on the allocation of pension plan assets. Based on the currently projected returns on these assets and related expenses, the Company selected an expected return on assets of 6.75%, the same as the prior-year rate. The following table presents the expected return on pension assets as compared with the actual return on pension assets:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in millions)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nExpected Return on Pension Assets\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nActual Return on Pension Assets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$70.5\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$121.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$58.4\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$127.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe difference between the expected return and the actual return on pension assets is included in actuarial gains and losses, which are amortized into annual pension expense as previously described.\n\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company estimated the remaining lives of participants in the pension plans using the Society of Actuaries\u2019 Pri-2012 Base Mortality Table. The no-collar table was used for salaried participants and the blue-collar table\n was used for hourly participants, both adjusted to reflect the historical experience of the Company\u2019s participants. The Company selected the MP-2020 scale for mortality improvement at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n\nAssumptions are selected on December 31 to calculate the succeeding year\u2019s expense. \n\n\nThe assumptions selected at December\u00a031, 2021 were as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Discount rate\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3.23%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Rate of increase in future compensation levels\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n4.50%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Expected long-term rate of return on assets\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n6.75%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Average remaining service period for participants\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n10 years\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Mortality Tables:\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBase Table\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPri-2012\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMortality Improvement Scale\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nMP-2020\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUsing these assumptions, pension benefit obligation as of December 31, 2021 was $1.14 billion and 2022 pension expense is expected to be approximately $10.7 million based on current demographics and structure of the plans.

In total, the Company\u2019s pension plans are overfunded (fair value of plan assets exceeds the projected benefit obligation) by $64.8 million at December\u00a031, 2021.

The Company expects to make pension plan and SERP contributions of \n$\n93.5\n million in \n202\n2\n, of which\n $\n75.0\n million are voluntary\n.\n\n\nEstimated Effective Income Tax Rate \n\n\nThe Company uses the liability method to determine its provision for income taxes. Accordingly, the annual provision for income taxes reflects estimates of the current liability for income taxes, estimates of the tax effect of financial reporting versus tax basis differences using statutory income tax rates and management\u2019s judgment with respect to any valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. The result is management\u2019s estimate of the annual effective tax rate (the ETR).\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIncome for tax purposes is determined through the application of the rules and regulations under the United States Internal Revenue Code and the statutes of various foreign, state and local tax jurisdictions in which the Company conducts business. Changes in the statutory tax rates and/or tax laws in these jurisdictions can have a material effect on the ETR. The effect of these changes, if material, is recognized when the change is enacted. \n\n\nAs prescribed by these tax regulations, as well as generally accepted accounting principles, the manner in which revenues and expenses are recognized for financial reporting and income tax purposes is not always the same. Therefore, these differences between the Company\u2019s pretax income for financial reporting purposes and the amount of taxable income for income tax purposes are treated as either temporary or permanent, depending on their nature.\n\n\nTemporary differences reflect revenues or expenses that are recognized in financial reporting in one period and taxable income in a different period. An example of a temporary difference is the use of the straight-line method of depreciation of machinery and equipment for financial reporting purposes and the use of an accelerated method for income tax purposes. Temporary differences result from differences between the financial reporting basis and tax basis of assets or liabilities and give rise to deferred tax assets or liabilities (i.e., future tax deductions or future taxable income). Therefore, when temporary differences occur, they are offset by a corresponding change in a deferred tax account. As such, total income tax expense as reported in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of earnings is not changed by temporary differences. \n\n\nThe Company has deferred tax liabilities, primarily for right-of-use assets, property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangibles, employee pension and postretirement benefits and partnerships and joint ventures. The deferred tax liabilities attributable to property, plant and equipment relate to accelerated depreciation and depletion methods used for income tax purposes as compared with the straight-line and units-of-production methods used for financial reporting purposes. These temporary differences will reverse over the remaining useful lives of the related assets. The deferred tax liabilities attributable to goodwill arise as a result of amortizing goodwill for income tax purposes but not for financial reporting purposes. This temporary difference reverses when goodwill is written off for financial reporting purposes, either through divestitures or an impairment charge. The timing of such events cannot be estimated. The deferred tax liabilities attributable to employee pension and postretirement benefits relate to deductions as plans are funded for income tax purposes compared with deductions for financial reporting purposes based on accounting standards. The reversal of these differences depends on the timing of the Company\u2019s contributions to the related benefit plans as compared to the annual expense for financial reporting purposes. The deferred tax liabilities attributable to partnerships and joint ventures relate to the difference between the tax basis of the investments in partnerships and joint ventures when compared to the basis for financial reporting purposes. The temporary difference reverses through differences recognized over the life of the investment or through divestiture.\n\n\nThe Company has deferred tax assets, primarily for inventories, unvested stock-based compensation awards, unrecognized losses related to the funded status of the pension and postretirement benefit plans, lease liabilities, valuation reserves, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. The deferred tax assets attributable to inventories and valuation reserves relate to the deduction of estimated cost reserves and various period expenses for financial reporting purposes that are deductible in a later period for income tax purposes. The reversal of these differences depends on facts and circumstances, including the timing of deduction for income tax purposes for reserves previously established and the establishment of additional reserves for financial reporting purposes. The deferred tax assets attributable to unvested stock-based compensation awards relate to differences in the timing of deductibility for financial reporting purposes versus income tax purposes. For financial reporting purposes, the fair value of the awards is deducted ratably over the requisite service period. For income tax purposes, no deduction is allowed until the award is vested or no longer subject to substantial risk of forfeiture. The Company reflects all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in income tax expense as a discrete event in the period in which the award vests or settles, increasing volatility in the income tax rate from period to period. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n \nPage 62\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPart II\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n\u00a0\u00a0Item 7 \u2013 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n\nBusiness Combinations \u2013 Allocation of Purchase Price \n\n\nThe Company\u2019s Board of Directors and management regularly review strategic long-term plans, including potential investments in value-added acquisitions of related or similar businesses, which would increase the Company\u2019s market presence and/or are related to the Company\u2019s existing markets. When an acquisition is completed, the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of earnings include the operating results of the acquired business starting from the date of acquisition, which is the date control is obtained. The purchase price is determined based on the fair value of assets and equity interests given to the seller and any future obligations to the seller as of the date of acquisition. The Company allocates the purchase price to the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as valued at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recorded for the excess of the purchase price over the net of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation is a critical accounting policy because the estimation of fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities is judgmental and requires various assumptions. Further, the amounts and useful lives assigned to depreciable and amortizable assets versus amounts assigned to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are not amortized, can significantly affect the results of operations in the period of and for periods subsequent to a business combination.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction, and, therefore, represents an exit price.\u00a0\u00a0Fair value measurement assumes the highest and best use of the asset by market participants, considering the use of the asset that is physically possible, legally permissible, and financially feasible at the measurement date.\u00a0\u00a0The Company assigns the highest level of fair value available to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the following options:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nLevel 1 \u2013 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nLevel 2 \u2013 Observable inputs, other than quoted prices, for similar assets or liabilities in active markets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nLevel 3 \u2013 Unobservable inputs, used to value the asset or liability which includes the use of valuation models\n\n\nLevel 1 fair values are used to value investments in publicly traded entities and assumed obligations for publicly traded long-term debt.\n\n\nLevel 2 fair values are typically used to value acquired receivables, inventories, machinery and equipment, land, buildings, deferred income tax assets and liabilities, and accruals for payables, asset retirement obligations, environmental remediation and compliance obligations, and contingencies. Additionally, Level 2 fair values are typically used to value assumed contracts at other-than-market rates.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nLevel 3 fair values are used to value acquired mineral reserves and mineral interests produced and sold as final products, and separately-identifiable intangible assets. The fair values are determined using an excess earnings approach, which requires significant judgment to estimate future cash flows, net of capital investments in the specific operation and contributory asset charges. The estimate of future cash flows is based on available historical information and future expectations and assumptions determined by management, but is inherently uncertain. Significant assumptions used to estimate future cash flows include changes in forecasted revenues based on sales price and shipment volumes as well as forecasted expenses inclusive of production costs and capital needs. The present value of the projected net cash flows represents the fair value assigned to mineral reserves and mineral interests. The discount rate is a significant assumption used in the valuation model and is based on the required rate of return that a hypothetical market participant would require if purchasing the acquired business, with an adjustment for the risk of these assets not generating the projected cash flows.\n\n\nThe Company values separately-identifiable acquired intangible assets which may include, but are not limited to, permits, customer relationships, water rights and noncompetition agreements. The fair values of these assets are typically determined by an excess earnings method, a replacement cost method or, in the case of water rights, a market approach. \n\n\nThe useful lives of amortizable intangible assets and the remaining useful lives for acquired machinery and equipment have a significant impact on earnings. The selected lives are based on the expected periods that the assets will provide value to the Company subsequent to the business combination.\n\n\nThe Company may adjust the amounts recognized for a business combination during a measurement period after the acquisition date. Any such adjustments are based on the Company obtaining additional information that existed at the acquisition date regarding the assets acquired or the liabilities assumed. Measurement-period adjustments are generally recorded as increases or decreases to the goodwill recognized in the transaction. The measurement period ends once the Company has obtained all necessary information that existed as of the acquisition date, but does not extend beyond one year from the date of acquisition. Any adjustments to assets acquired or liabilities assumed beyond the measurement period are recorded through earnings.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n \nPage 63\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPart II\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n\u00a0\u00a0Item 7 \u2013 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment \n\n\nNet property, plant and equipment represented 44% (excluding the amount allocated to assets held for sale) of total assets at December\u00a031, 2021. Accordingly, accounting for these assets represents a critical accounting policy. Useful lives of the assets can vary depending on factors, including production levels, geographic location, portability and maintenance practices. Additionally, climate and inclement weather can reduce the useful life of an asset. Historically, the Company has not recognized significant losses on the disposal or retirement of fixed assets.\n\n\nAggregates mineral reserves and mineral interests are components within the plant, property and equipment balance on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company evaluates aggregates reserves, including those used in the cement manufacturing process, in several ways, depending on the geology at a particular location and whether the location is a greensite, an acquisition or an existing operation. Greensites require an extensive drilling program before any significant investment is made in terms of time, site development or efforts to obtain appropriate zoning and permitting (see \nEnvironmental Regulation and Litigation\n section). The depth of overburden and the quality and quantity of the aggregates reserves are significant factors in determining whether to pursue opening the site. Further, the estimated average selling price for products in a market is also a significant factor in concluding that reserves are economically mineable. If the Company\u2019s analysis based on these factors is satisfactory, the total aggregates reserves available are calculated and a determination is made whether to open the location. Reserve evaluation at existing locations is typically performed to evaluate purchasing \nadjoining properties, for quality control, calculating overburden volumes and for mine planning. Reserve evaluation of acquisitions may require a higher degree of sampling to locate any problem areas that may exist and to verify the total reserves.\n \n\n\nWell-ordered subsurface sampling of the underlying deposit is basic to determining reserves at any location. This subsurface sampling usually involves one or more types of drilling, determined by the nature of the material to be sampled and the particular objective of the sampling. The Company\u2019s objectives are to ensure that the underlying deposit meets aggregates specifications and the total reserves on site are sufficient for mining and economically recoverable. Locations underlain with hard rock deposits, such as granite and limestone, are drilled using the diamond core method, which provides the most useful and accurate samples of the deposit. Selected core samples are tested for soundness, abrasion resistance and other physical properties relevant to the aggregates industry and depend on the aggregates use. The number and depth of the holes are determined by the size of the site and the complexity of the site-specific geology. Some geological factors that may affect the number and depth of holes include faults, folds, chemical irregularities, clay pockets, thickness of formations and weathering. A typical spacing of core holes on the area to be tested is one hole for every four acres, but wider spacing may be justified if the deposit is homogeneous. \n\n\nDespite previous drilling and sampling, once accessed, the quality of reserves within a deposit can vary. Construction contracts, for the infrastructure market in particular, include specifications related to the aggregates material. If a flaw in the deposit is discovered, the aggregates material may not meet the required specifications. Although it is possible that the aggregates material can still be used for non-specification uses, this can have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to serve certain customers or on the Company\u2019s profitability. In addition, other issues can arise that limit the Company\u2019s ability to access reserves in a particular quarry, including geological occurrences, blasting practices and zoning issues.\n\n\nLocations underlain with sand and gravel are typically drilled using the auger method, whereby a six-inch corkscrew brings up material from below the ground which is then sampled. Deposits in these locations are typically limited in thickness. Additionally, the quality and sand-to-gravel ratio of the deposit can vary both horizontally and vertically. Hole spacing at these locations is approximately one hole for every acre to ensure a representative sampling. \n\n\nThe geologist conducting the reserve evaluation makes the decision as to the number of holes and the spacing in accordance with standards and procedures established by the Company. Further, the anticipated heterogeneity of the deposit, based on U.S. geological maps, also dictates the number of holes drilled.\n\n\nThe generally accepted reserve categories for the aggregates industry and the designations the Company uses for reserve categories are summarized as follows:\n\n\nProven Reserves\n \u2013 These reserves are designated using closely spaced drill data as described above and a determination by a professional geologist that the deposit is relatively homogeneous based on the drilling results and exploration data provided in U.S. geologic maps, the U.S. Department of Agriculture soil maps, aerial photographs and/or electromagnetic, seismic or other surveys conducted by independent geotechnical engineering firms. The proven reserves that are recorded reflect reductions incurred through quarrying that result from leaving ramps, safety benches, pillars (underground) and the fines (small particles) that will be generated during processing. Proven reserves are further reduced by reserves that are under the plant and stockpile areas, as well as setbacks from neighboring property lines. The Company typically assumes a loss factor of 25%. However, the assumed loss \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n \nPage 64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPart II\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n\u00a0\u00a0Item 7 \u2013 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n\nfactor at coastal operations is approximately 40% due to the nature of the material. The assumed loss factor for underground operations is 35% primarily due to pillars. \n\n\nProbable Reserves\n \u2013 These reserves are inferred utilizing fewer drill holes and/or assumptions about the economically recoverable reserves based on local geology or drill results from adjacent properties.\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s proven and probable reserves reflect reasonable economic and operating constraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation, and also include reserves at the Company\u2019s inactive and undeveloped sites, including some sites where permitting and zoning applications will not be filed until warranted by expected future growth. The Company has historically been successful in obtaining and maintaining appropriate zoning and permitting (see \nEnvironmental Regulation and Litigation\n section).\n\n\nMineral reserves and mineral interests, when acquired in connection with a business combination, are valued using an excess earnings approach for the life of the proven and probable reserves.\n\n\nThe Company uses proven and probable reserves as the denominator in its units-of-production calculation to record depletion expense for its mineral reserves and mineral interests. For 2021, depletion expense was $46.0 million.\n\n\nThe Company begins capitalizing quarry development costs at a point when reserves are determined to be proven or probable, economically mineable and when demand supports investment in the market. Capitalization of these costs ceases when production commences. Capitalized quarry development costs are classified as land improvements.\n\n\nNew mining areas may be developed at existing quarries in order to access additional reserves. When this occurs, management reviews the facts and circumstances of each situation in making a determination as to the appropriateness of capitalizing or expensing the related pre-production development costs. If the additional mining location operates in a separate and distinct area of a quarry, the costs are capitalized as quarry development costs and depreciated over the life of the uncovered reserves. Further, a separate asset retirement obligation is created for additional mining areas when the liability is incurred. Once a new mining area enters the production phase, all post-production stripping costs are expensed as incurred as periodic inventory production costs. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n \nPage 65\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPart II\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n\u00a0\u00a0Item 7 \u2013 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n\nForward-Looking Statements \u2013 Safe Harbor Provisions Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\n\n\nIf you are interested in Martin Marietta stock, management recommends that, at a minimum, you read the Company\u2019s current annual report and Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the past year.

If these negatively affect transportation budgets more than in the past, construction spending could be reduced. Cement is subject to cyclical supply and demand and price fluctuations. \n\n\nThe Company\u2019s principal business serves customers in construction markets. This concentration could increase the risk of potential losses on customer receivables; however, payment bonds normally posted on public projects, together with lien rights on private projects, mitigate the risk of uncollectible receivables. The level of demand in the Company\u2019s end-use markets, production levels and the management of production costs will affect the operating leverage of the Building Materials business and, therefore, profitability. Production costs in the Building Materials business are also sensitive to energy and raw material prices, both directly and indirectly. Diesel fuel, coal and other consumables change production costs directly through consumption or indirectly by increased energy-related input costs, such as steel, explosives, tires and conveyor belts. Fluctuating diesel fuel pricing also affects transportation costs, primarily through fuel surcharges in the Company\u2019s long-haul distribution network. The Magnesia Specialties business is sensitive to changes in domestic steel capacity utilization as well as the absolute price and fluctuation in the cost of natural gas.\n\n\nTransportation in the Company\u2019s long-haul network, particularly the supply of railcars and locomotive power and condition of rail infrastructure to move trains, affects the Company\u2019s efficient transportation of aggregates products in certain markets, most notably Texas, Colorado, Florida, North Carolina and the Gulf Coast. In addition, availability of railcars and locomotives affects the Company\u2019s movement of essential dolomitic lime for magnesia chemicals to both the Company\u2019s plant in Manistee, Michigan, and its customers. The availability of trucks, drivers and railcars to transport the Company\u2019s product, particularly in markets experiencing high growth and increased demand, is also a risk and pressures the associated costs. \n\n\nAll of the Company\u2019s businesses are also subject to weather-related risks that can significantly affect production schedules and profitability. The first and fourth quarters are most adversely affected by winter weather. Hurricane activity in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast generally is most active during the third and fourth quarters. \n\n\nRisks also include shipment declines resulting from economic events beyond the Company\u2019s control. \n\n\nIn addition to the foregoing, other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report include but are not limited to those listed above in Item 1, \u201cBusiness \u2013 Competition,\n\u201d Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d and \n\u201cNote A: Accounting Policies\u201d and \u201cNote O: Commitments and Contingencies\u201d of the \u201cNotes to Financial Statements\u201d of the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. \n\n\nYou should consider these forward-looking statements in light of risk factors discussed in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and other filings made with the SEC.\u00a0\u00a0All of the Company\u2019s forward-looking statements should be considered in light of these factors.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, other risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company considers immaterial could affect the accuracy of its forward-looking statements, or adversely affect or be material to the Company.\u00a0\u00a0All forward-looking statements are made as of the date of filing or publication and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n \nPage 68\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPart II\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n\u00a0\u00a0Item 7A \u2013 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "item7a": ">ITEM\u00a07A \u2013 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK \n\n\nAs discussed earlier, the Company\u2019s operations are highly dependent upon the interest rate-sensitive construction and steelmaking industries. Consequently, these marketplaces could experience lower levels of economic activity in an environment of rising interest rates or escalating costs (see \nBusiness Environment\n section included under Item 7 \u2013 MD&A of this Form 10-K).\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nManagement has considered the current economic environment and its potential impact to the Company\u2019s business. Demand for aggregates products, particularly in the infrastructure construction market, is affected by federal and state budget and deficit issues. Further, delays or cancellations of capital projects in the nonresidential and residential construction markets could occur if companies and consumers are unable to obtain financing for construction projects or if consumer confidence is eroded by economic uncertainty.\n\n\nDemand in the residential construction market is affected by interest rates. During 2021, the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate, and at December 31, 2021, the rate was 0.07%. The residential construction market accounted for approximately 25% of the Company\u2019s organic aggregates shipments in 2021. \n\n\nAside from these inherent risks from within its operations, the Company\u2019s earnings are also affected by changes in short-term interest rates. \n\n\nVariable-Rate Borrowing Facilities\n\n\nAt December\u00a031, 2021, the Company had an $800.0 million Revolving Facility and a $400.0 million Trade Receivable Facility.\u00a0\u00a0Borrowings under these facilities bear interest at a variable interest rate. As of December 31, 2021, the Company did not have any outstanding variable-rate debt.\u00a0\u00a0However, any future borrowings under the credit facilities or outstanding variable-rate debt are exposed to interest rate risk.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nPension Expense\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations are affected by its pension expense. Assumptions that affect pension expense include the discount rate and, for the qualified defined benefit pension plan only, the expected long-term rate of return on assets. Therefore, the Company has interest rate risk associated with these factors. The impact of hypothetical changes in these assumptions on the Company\u2019s annual pension expense is discussed in the \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \u2013 Pension Expense \u2013 Selection of Assumptions\n section included under Item 7 \u2013 MD&A of this Form 10-K.\n\n\nEnergy Costs \n\n\nEnergy costs, including diesel fuel, natural gas, coal, petroleum coke and liquid asphalt, represent significant production costs of the Company. The Company may be unable to pass along increases in the costs of energy to customers in the form of price increases for the Company\u2019s products. The cement product line and Magnesia Specialties business each have varying fixed-price agreements for a portion of their energy requirements. A hypothetical 10% change in the Company\u2019s energy prices in 2022 as compared with 2021, assuming constant volumes, would change 2022 energy expense by $33.3 million. \n\n\nCommodity Risk\n\n\nCement is a commodity and competition is based principally on price, which is highly sensitive to changes in supply and demand. Prices are often subject to material changes in response to relatively minor fluctuations in supply and demand, general economic conditions and other market conditions beyond the Company\u2019s control. Increases in the production capacity of industry participants or increases in cement imports tend to create an oversupply of such products leading to an imbalance between supply and demand, which can have a negative impact on product prices. There can be no assurance that product prices will not decline in the future or that such declines will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. A hypothetical 10% change in sales price of the cement product line would impact cement product line revenues by $49.4 million. \n\n\nCement is a key raw material in the production of ready mixed concrete. The Company may be unable to pass along increases in the costs of cement and raw materials to customers in the form of price increases for the Company\u2019s products. A hypothetical 10% change in cement costs in 2022 compared with 2021, assuming constant volumes, would change the ready mixed concrete product line cost of sales by $31.5 million. While increases in cement pricing may negatively impact the profitability of the ready mixed concrete operations, the cement business would benefit, although the positive impact may not reflect a direct correlation to the impact to the ready mix business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n \nPage 69\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPart II\u00a0\u00a0\n\u2666\n\u00a0\u00a0Item 8 \u2013 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "companyName": "Martin Marietta Materia", "cusip": "573284106"}
