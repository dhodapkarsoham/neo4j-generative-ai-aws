Our purpose is to advance sustainable economic growth and financial opportunity. Our goal, reflected in our \nOne Goldman Sachs \ninitiative, is to deliver the full range of our services and expertise to support our clients in a more accessible, comprehensive and efficient manner, across businesses and product areas. \n \nWhen we use the terms \u201cGoldman Sachs,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d and \u201cour,\u201d we mean The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Group Inc. or parent company), a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries. When we use the term \u201cour subsidiaries,\u201d we mean the consolidated subsidiaries of Group Inc.

Our U.S. depository institution subsidiary, Goldman Sachs Bank USA (GS Bank USA), is a New York State-chartered bank. \n \nOur Business Segments \n \nWe report our activities in four business segments: Investment Banking, Global Markets, Asset Management, and Consumer\u00a0& Wealth Management. Investment Banking generates revenues from financial advisory, underwriting and corporate lending activities. Global Markets consists of Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) and Equities, and generates revenues from intermediation and financing activities. Asset Management generates revenues from management and other fees, incentive fees, equity investments, and lending and debt investments. Consumer\u00a0& Wealth Management consists of Wealth management and Consumer banking, and generates revenues from management and other fees, incentive fees, private banking and lending, and consumer-oriented activities. \n \n \n \nThe chart below presents our four business segments and their revenue sources. \n \n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \nInvestment Banking \n \nInvestment Banking serves public and private sector clients around the world. We provide financial advisory services, help companies raise capital to strengthen and grow their businesses and provide financing to corporate clients. We seek to develop and maintain long-term relationships with a diverse global group of institutional clients, including corporations, governments, states and municipalities. Our goal is to deliver to our institutional clients all of our resources in a seamless fashion, with investment banking serving as the main initial point of contact. \n \nInvestment Banking generates revenues from the following: \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nFinancial advisory.\n We have been a leader for many years in providing financial advisory services, including strategic advisory assignments with respect to mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, corporate defense activities, restructurings and spin-offs. In particular, we help clients execute large, complex transactions for which we provide multiple services, including cross-border structuring expertise. We also assist our clients in managing their asset and liability exposures and their capital. \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nUnderwriting.\n We help companies raise capital to fund their businesses. As a financial intermediary, our job is to match the capital of our investing clients, who aim to grow the savings of\u00a0millions of people, with the needs of our public and private sector clients, who need financing to generate growth, create jobs and deliver products and services. Our underwriting activities include public offerings and private placements, including local and cross-border transactions and acquisition financing, of a wide range of securities and other financial instruments, including loans. Underwriting consists of the following: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nEquity underwriting\n.\n We underwrite common and preferred stock and convertible and exchangeable securities. We regularly receive mandates for large, complex transactions and have held a leading position in worldwide public common stock offerings and worldwide initial public offerings for many years. \n \nDebt underwriting\n.\n \nWe underwrite and originate various types of debt instruments, including investment-grade and high-yield debt, bank and bridge loans, including in connection with acquisition financing, and emerging- and growth-market debt, which may be issued by, among others, corporate, sovereign, municipal and agency issuers. In addition, we underwrite and originate structured securities, which include mortgage-related securities and other asset-backed securities. \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nCorporate lending.\n \nWe lend to corporate clients, including through relationship lending, middle-market lending and acquisition financing. The hedges related to this lending and financing activity are reported as part of our corporate lending activity. \n \n \n \n \n \nWe also provide transaction banking services, including to certain of our corporate and financial institution clients. Transaction banking revenues include net interest income attributed to transaction banking deposits. \n \nGlobal Markets \n \nGlobal Markets serves our clients who buy and sell financial products, raise funding and manage risk. We do this by acting as a market maker and offering market expertise on a global basis. Global Markets makes markets and facilitates client transactions in fixed income, equity, currency and commodity products. In addition, we make markets in, and clear client transactions on, major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide. \n \nAs a market maker, we provide prices to clients globally across\u00a0thousands of products in all major asset classes and markets. At times, we take the other side of transactions ourselves if a buyer or seller is not readily available, and at other times we connect our clients to other parties who want to transact. Our willingness to make markets, commit capital and take risk in a broad range of products is crucial to our client relationships. Market makers provide liquidity and play a critical role in price discovery, which contributes to the overall efficiency of the capital markets. In connection with our market-making activities, we maintain (i)\u00a0market-making positions, typically for a short period of time, in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand, and (ii)\u00a0positions to actively manage our risk exposures that arise from these market-making activities (collectively, inventory). \n \n \n \nOur clients are institutions that are primarily professional market participants, including investment entities whose ultimate clients include individual investors investing for their retirement, buying insurance or saving surplus cash. \n \nWe execute a high volume of transactions for our clients in large, highly liquid markets (such as markets for U.S. Treasury securities, stocks and certain agency mortgage pass-through securities). We also execute transactions for our clients in less liquid markets (such as \nmid-cap\n corporate bonds, emerging market currencies and certain \nnon-agency\n mortgage-backed securities) for spreads and fees that are generally somewhat larger than those charged in more liquid markets. Additionally, we structure and execute transactions involving customized or tailor-made products that address our clients\u2019 risk exposures, investment objectives or other complex needs (such as a jet fuel hedge for an airline), as well as derivative transactions related to client advisory and underwriting activities. \n \nThrough our global sales force, we maintain relationships with our clients, receiving orders and distributing investment research, trading ideas, market information and analysis. Much of this connectivity between us and our clients is maintained on technology platforms, including \nMarquee\n, and operates globally where markets are open for trading. \nMarquee\n provides institutional investors with market intelligence, risk analytics, proprietary datasets and trade execution across multiple asset classes. \n \nGlobal Markets and our other businesses are supported by our Global Investment Research division, which, as of December\u00a02021, provided fundamental research on approximately 3,000 companies worldwide and approximately 50 national economies, as well as on industries, currencies and commodities. \n \nGlobal Markets activities are organized by asset class and include both \u201ccash\u201d and \u201cderivative\u201d instruments. \u201cCash\u201d refers to trading the underlying instrument (such as a stock, bond or barrel of oil). \u201cDerivative\u201d refers to instruments that derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates and other inputs, or a combination of these factors (such as an option, which is the right or obligation to buy or sell a certain bond, stock or other asset on a specified date in the future at a certain price, or an interest rate swap, which is the agreement to convert a fixed rate of interest into a floating rate or vice versa). \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In addition, we are an active participant in \nbroker-to-broker\n securities lending and third-party agency lending activities. \n \nWe provide financing to our clients for their securities trading activities through margin loans that are collateralized by securities, cash or other acceptable collateral.

Because we are a BHC, our Business Continuity\u00a0& Technology Resilience Program is also subject to review by the FRB. The key elements of the program are crisis management, business continuity, technology resilience, business recovery, assurance and verification, and process improvement. In the area of information security, we have developed and implemented a framework of principles, policies and technology designed to protect the information provided to us by our clients and our own information from cyber attacks and other misappropriation, corruption or loss. Safeguards are designed to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information.

We believe that diversity at all levels of our organization, from entry-level analysts to senior management, as well as the Board of Directors of Group Inc. (Board), which as of December\u00a02021, was approximately 62% diverse by race, gender or sexual orientation, is essential to our sustainability. Our management team works closely with our Global Inclusion and Diversity Committee to continue to increase diversity of our global workforce at all levels. In addition, we have global and regional Inclusion and Diversity Committees which promote an environment that values different perspectives, challenges conventional thinking and maximizes the potential of all our people. \n \nWe believe that increased diversity, including diversity of experience, gender identity, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability and veteran status, in addition to being a social imperative, is vital to our commercial success through the creativity that it fosters. For this reason, we have established a comprehensive action plan with aspirational diversity hiring goals which are set forth below and are focused on cultivating an inclusive environment for all our colleagues. \n \nDiverse leadership is crucial to our long-term success and to driving innovation, and we have implemented and expanded outreach and career advancement programs for rising diverse executive talent. For example, we are focused on providing diverse vice presidents the necessary coaching, sponsorship and advocacy to support their career trajectories and strengthen their leadership platforms, including through programs, such as our Vice President Career Investment Initiative focused on high-performing Black and Hispanic/Latinx VPs in the Americas and EMEA. Many other career development initiatives are aimed at fostering diverse talent at the analyst and associate level, including the Black Analyst and Associate Initiative, the Hispanic/Latinx Analyst Initiative and the Women\u2019s Career Strategies Initiative. We have also established Inclusion Networks and Interest Forums that are open to all professionals at Goldman Sachs to promote and advance connectivity, understanding, inclusion and diversity. \n \n \n \nProgress Toward Aspirational Goals.\n Reflecting our efforts to increase diversity, the composition of our most recent partnership class was 27% women professionals, 17% Asian professionals, 7% Black professionals and 5% Hispanic/Latinx professionals. The composition of our most recent managing director class was 30% women professionals, 28% Asian professionals, 5% Black professionals and 5% Hispanic/Latinx professionals. \n \nWe have also set forth the following aspirational goals: \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nWe aim for analyst and associate hiring (which accounts for over 70% of our annual hiring) to achieve representation of 50% women professionals, 11% Black professionals and 14% Hispanic/Latinx professionals in the Americas, and 9% Black professionals in the U.K. In 2021, our analyst and associate hires included 45% women professionals, 11% Black professionals and 15% Hispanic/Latinx professionals in the Americas, and 14% Black professionals in the U.K. \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nWe aim for women professionals to represent 40% of our vice presidents globally by 2025 and 30% of senior talent (vice presidents and above) in the U.K. by 2023, while also endeavoring for women employees to comprise 50% of all of our employees globally over time. As of December\u00a02021, women professionals represented 32% of our vice president population globally and 31% of senior talent (vice presidents and above) in the U.K., and women employees represented 41% of all of our employees globally. \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nWe aim for Black professionals to represent 7% of our vice president population in the Americas and in the U.K., and for Hispanic/Latinx professionals to represent 9% of our vice president population in the Americas, both by 2025.

Our goals are to maximize individual capabilities, increase commercial effectiveness and innovation, reinforce our culture, expand professional opportunities, and help our people contribute positively to their communities. \n \nInstilling our culture in all employees is a continuous process, in which training plays an important part. We offer our employees the opportunity to participate in ongoing educational offerings and periodic seminars through Goldman Sachs University. To accelerate their integration into the firm and our culture, new hires have the opportunity to receive training before they start working and orientation programs with an emphasis on culture and networking, and nearly all employees participate in at least one training event each year. For our more senior employees, we provide guidance and training on how to manage people and projects effectively, exhibit strong leadership and exemplify our culture. We are also focused on developing a high performing, diverse leadership pipeline and career planning for our next generation of leaders. We maintain a variety of programs aimed at employees\u2019 professional growth and support throughout their careers and as they evolve into leaders, including initiatives, such as our Vice President and Managing Director Leadership Acceleration Initiatives. \n \nEnhancing our people\u2019s experience of internal mobility is a key focus, as we believe that this will inspire employees, help retain top talent and create diverse experiences to build future leaders. \n \nAnother important part of instilling our culture is our employee performance review process. Employees are reviewed by supervisors, \nco-workers\n and employees whom they supervise in a \n360-degree\n review process that is integral to our team approach and includes an evaluation of an employee\u2019s performance with respect to risk management, protecting our reputation, adherence to our code of conduct, compliance, and diversity and inclusion principles. Our approach to evaluating employee performance centers on providing robust, timely and actionable feedback that facilitates professional development. We have directed our managers, as leaders at the firm, to take an active coaching role with their teams. We have also implemented \u201cThe Three Conversations at GS\u201d through which managers establish goals with their team members at the start of the year, check in \nmid-year\n on progress and then close out the year with a conversation on performance against goals. \n \n \n \nWe believe that our people value opportunities to contribute to their communities and that these opportunities enhance their job satisfaction. We also believe that being able to volunteer together with colleagues and participate in community organizations working on local service projects strengthens our people\u2019s bond with us. Community TeamWorks, our signature volunteering initiative, enables our people to participate in high-impact, team-based volunteer opportunities, including projects coordinated with hundreds of nonprofit partner organizations worldwide. During 2021, our people volunteered approximately 80,000\u00a0hours of service globally through Community TeamWorks, with approximately 15,000 employees partnering with approximately 370 nonprofit organizations on approximately 800 community projects. To respond to the interest of our people in helping with the response to the \nCOVID-19\n pandemic, we have developed a series of opportunities to support vulnerable populations remotely, including small business owners, students and the elderly. \n \nWellness \n \nWe recognize that for our people to be successful in the workplace they need support in their personal, as well as their professional lives. We have created a strong support framework for wellness, which is intended to enable employees to better balance their roles at work and their responsibilities at home. In addition to providing 20\u00a0weeks of parental leave for all employees, we provide other benefits to support the wellness of our employees, including family care leave, bereavement leave and, for longer-tenured employees, an unpaid sabbatical leave. We also continue to advance our resilience programs, offering our people a range of counseling, coaching, medical advisory and personal wellness services. We have increased the availability of these resources during the \nCOVID-19\n pandemic, and we have continued to evolve and strengthen virtual offerings with the aim of maintaining the physical and mental well-being of our employees, enhancing their effectiveness and cohesiveness and providing them with greater opportunities to access support. \n \nWe also introduced a \nCOVID-19\n \n10-day\n family leave policy, available to our people globally to care for family members due to \nCOVID-19\n related illness or meet childcare needs, including homeschooling. We remain focused on facilitating the safe return of our employees to our offices, as circumstances permit, and employees in a number of our locations around the world have returned to the office to varying degrees. Given that the situation regarding the \nCOVID-19\n pandemic varies geographically, our approach to transitioning back to the office is tailored to each location, and it evolves based on the specific conditions and requirements of each location. We have comprehensive protocols in place, including regular testing, and we will continue to be guided by a people-first approach as circumstances evolve. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n7\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nIn addition, to support the financial wellness of our employees, we offer a variety of resources that help them manage their personal financial health and decision-making, including financial education series, live and \non-demand\n webinars, articles and interactive digital tools. \n \nGlobal Reach and Strategic Locations \n \nAs a firm with a global client base, we take a strategic approach to attracting, developing and managing a global workforce. Our clients are located worldwide and we are an active participant in financial markets around the world. As of December\u00a02021, we had headcount of 43,900, offices in over 35\u00a0countries and 52% of our headcount was based in the Americas, 18% in EMEA and 30% in Asia. Our employees come from over 180 countries and speak more than 110 languages as of December\u00a02021. \n \nIn addition to maintaining offices in major financial centers around the world, we have established key strategic locations, including in Bengaluru, Salt Lake City, Dallas, Singapore and Warsaw. We continue to evaluate the expanded use of strategic locations, including cities in which we do not currently have a presence. \n \nAs of December\u00a02021, 40% of our employees were working in one of these key strategic locations. We believe our investment in these strategic locations enables us to build centers of excellence around specific capabilities that support our business initiatives. \n \nSustainability \n \nWe have a long-standing commitment to sustainability. Our two priorities in this area are helping clients across industries facilitate and thrive in a \nlow-carbon\n economy (Climate Transition) and leveraging our capabilities to advance economic empowerment (Inclusive Growth). \n \nWe have established a Sustainable Finance Group, which serves as the centralized group that drives climate strategy and sustainability efforts across our firm, including commercial efforts alongside our businesses to advance Climate Transition and Inclusive Growth. In 2020, we created a new role, Global Head of Sustainability and Inclusive Growth, which, like our \nOne Goldman Sachs \ninitiative, is intended to facilitate the application of our full capabilities across both Climate Transition and Inclusive Growth. Each of our segments has launched a Sustainability Council. These councils focus on identifying key Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) priorities for the segment, developing sustainability-related capabilities and delivering sustainability-focused solutions to clients in a holistic way. \n \n \n \nOur activities relating to sustainability present both financial and nonfinancial risks, and we have processes for managing these risks, similar to the other risks we face. We have integrated oversight of climate-related risks into our risk management governance structure, from senior management to our Board and its committees, including the Risk and Public Responsibilities Committees. The Risk Committee of the Board oversees firmwide financial and nonfinancial risks, which include climate risk, and, as part of its oversight, receives updates on our risk management approach to climate risk. The Public Responsibilities Committee of the Board assists the Board in its oversight of our firmwide sustainability strategy and sustainability risks affecting us, including with respect to climate change. As part of its oversight, the Public Responsibilities Committee receives periodic updates on our sustainability strategy, and also periodically reviews our governance and related policies and processes for sustainability and climate change-related risks. We have also implemented an Environmental Policy Framework to guide our overall approach to sustainability issues. We apply this Framework when evaluating transactions for environmental and social risks and impacts. Our employees also receive training with respect to environmental and social risks, including for sectors and industries that we believe have higher potential for these risks.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nAs a leading financial institution, we acknowledge the importance of Climate Transition for our business. In February\u00a02021, we launched our inaugural sustainability bond of $800\u00a0million, which is aligned with our sustainable finance framework for future issuances and funds a range of \non-balance\n sheet sustainable finance activity. In addition, we are working with various external groups to develop methods, metrics and frameworks for the financial sector, with an aim to support greater consistency, comparability and utility in approaches to measuring the financial sector\u2019s contribution to Climate Transition initiatives. We believe we can advance sustainability by partnering with our clients across our businesses, including by developing new sustainability-linked financing solutions, offering strategic advice, or coinvesting alongside our clients in clean energy companies. We have announced a target to deploy $750\u00a0billion in sustainable financing, investing and advisory activity by the beginning of 2030. As of December\u00a02021, we achieved approximately 40% of that goal, with the majority dedicated to Climate Transition. In addition, we have announced our commitment to align our financing activities with a \nnet-zero-by-2050\n pathway. In that context, we have set an initial set of targets for 2030 focused on three sectors\u00a0\u2014 power, oil and gas, and auto manufacturing\u00a0\u2014 where we believe we can have the most significant impact and we see an opportunity to proactively engage our clients, investors, advocacy groups and multi-stakeholder organizations, deploy capital required for transition, and invest in new commercial solutions to drive decarbonization in the real economy. Carbon neutrality is also a priority for the operation of our firm and our supply chain. In 2015, we achieved carbon neutrality in our operations and business travel, ahead of our 2020 goal announced in 2009. We have expanded our operational carbon commitment to include our supply chain, targeting \nnet-zero\n carbon emissions by 2030. \n \nIn addition to Climate Transition, our approach to sustainability also centers on Inclusive Growth and advancing economic empowerment and financial opportunity for all. We have sponsored initiatives, such as \nOne\n Million Black Women,\n \nLaunch With GS, our Urban Investment Group, 10,000 Women and 10,000 Small Businesses\n. An overarching theme of our sustainability strategy is promoting diversity and inclusion as an imperative for us, as well as our clients and their boards. These efforts are further strengthened by strategic partnerships that we have established in areas where we have identified gaps, or believe we are able to drive even greater impact through collaboration. We also believe our ability to achieve our sustainability objectives is critically dependent on the strengths and talents of our people, and we recognize that our people are able to maximize their impact by collaborating in a diverse and inclusive work environment. See \u201cBusiness\u00a0\u2014 Human Capital Management\u201d for information about our human capital management goals, programs and policies. \n \n \n \nCompetition \n \nThe financial services industry and all of our businesses are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. Our competitors are other entities that provide investment banking (including transaction banking), market-making, investment management services, commercial and/or consumer lending, deposit-taking and other banking products and services, as well as those entities that make investments in securities, commodities, derivatives, real estate, loans and other financial assets. These entities include brokers and dealers, investment banking firms, commercial banks, credit card issuers, insurance companies, investment advisers, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, merchant banks, consumer finance companies and financial technology and other internet-based companies. We compete with some entities globally and with others on a regional, product or niche basis. We compete based on a number of factors, including transaction execution, client experience, products and services, innovation, reputation and price. \n \nWe have faced, and expect to continue to face, pressure to retain market share by committing capital to businesses or transactions on terms that offer returns that may not be commensurate with their risks. In particular, corporate clients seek such commitments (such as agreements to participate in their loan facilities) from financial services firms in connection with investment banking and other assignments. \n \nConsolidation and convergence have significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of some of our competitors, and have also hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets. As a result, we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions. To capitalize on some of our most significant opportunities, we will have to compete successfully with financial institutions that are larger and have more capital and that may have a stronger local presence and longer operating history outside the U.S. \n \nWe also compete with smaller institutions that offer more targeted services, such as independent advisory firms. Some clients may perceive these firms to be less susceptible to potential conflicts of interest than we are, and, as described below, our ability to effectively compete with them could be affected by regulations and limitations on activities that apply to us but may not apply to them. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n9\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nA number of our businesses are subject to intense price competition. Efforts by our competitors to gain market share have resulted in pricing pressure in our investment banking, market-making, consumer, wealth management and asset management businesses. For example, the increasing volume of trades executed electronically, through the internet and through alternative trading systems, has increased the pressure on trading commissions, in that commissions for electronic trading are generally lower than those for \nnon-electronic\n trading. It appears that this trend toward \nlow-commission\n trading will continue. Price competition has also led to compression in the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing to sell an instrument and the price at which another market participant is willing to buy it (i.e., bid/offer spread), which has affected our market-making businesses. The increasing prevalence of passive investment strategies that typically have lower fees than other strategies we offer has affected the competitive and pricing dynamics for our asset management products and services. In addition, we believe that we will continue to experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by further reducing prices, and as we enter into or expand our presence in markets that may rely more heavily on electronic trading and execution. We and other banks also compete for deposits on the basis of the rates we offer. Increases in short-term interest rates are expected to result in more intense competition in deposit pricing. \n \nWe also compete on the basis of the types of financial products and client experiences that we and our competitors offer. In some circumstances, our competitors may offer financial products that we do not offer and that our clients may prefer, or our competitors may develop technology platforms that provide a better client experience. \n \nThe provisions of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), the requirements promulgated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and other financial regulations could affect our competitive position to the extent that limitations on activities, increased fees and compliance costs or other regulatory requirements do not apply, or do not apply equally, to all of our competitors or are not implemented uniformly across different jurisdictions. For example, the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that prohibit proprietary trading and restrict investments in certain hedge and private equity funds differentiate between U.S.-based and \nnon-U.S.-based\n banking organizations and give \nnon-U.S.-based\n banking organizations greater flexibility to trade outside of the U.S. and to form and invest in funds outside the U.S. \n \n \n \nLikewise, the obligations with respect to derivative transactions under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act depend, in part, on the location of the counterparties to the transaction. The impact of regulatory developments on our competitive position has depended and will continue to depend to a large extent on the manner in which the required rulemaking and regulatory guidance evolve, the extent of international convergence, and the development of market practice and structures under the evolving regulatory regimes, as described further in \u201cRegulation\u201d below. \n \nWe also face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively has depended and will continue to depend upon our ability to attract new employees, retain and motivate our existing employees and to continue to compensate employees competitively amid intense public and regulatory scrutiny on the compensation practices of large financial institutions. Our pay practices and those of certain of our competitors are subject to review by, and the standards of, the FRB and other regulators inside and outside the U.S., including the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the U.K. We also compete for employees with institutions whose pay practices are not subject to regulatory oversight. See \u201cRegulation\u00a0\u2014 Compensation Practices\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u00a0\u2014 Competition\u00a0\u2014 Our businesses may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees\u201d in Part\u00a0I, Item\u00a01A of this \nForm\u00a010-K\n for further information about such regulation. \n \nRegulation \n \nAs a participant in the global financial services industry, we are subject to extensive regulation and supervision worldwide. The regulatory regimes applicable to our operations worldwide have been, and continue to be, subject to significant changes. The Basel Committee is the primary global standard setter for prudential bank regulation; however, its standards do not become effective in a jurisdiction until the relevant regulators have adopted rules to implement its standards. The implications of these regulations for our businesses depend to a large extent on their implementation by the relevant regulators globally, and the market practices and structures that develop. \n \nNew regulations have been adopted or are being considered by regulators and policy makers worldwide, as described below. The effects of any changes to the regulations affecting our businesses, including as a result of the proposals described below, are uncertain and will not be known until such changes are finalized and market practices and structures develop under the revised regulations. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nOur principal subsidiaries operating in the U.S. include GS Bank USA, Goldman Sachs\u00a0& Co. LLC (GS&Co.), J.\u00a0Aron\u00a0& Company LLC (J.\u00a0Aron) and Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. Our principal subsidiaries operating in Europe include Goldman Sachs International (GSI), GSIB and Goldman Sachs Asset Management International (GSAMI), which are incorporated and headquartered in the U.K., and Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE (GSBE), which is incorporated and headquartered in Germany. Our principal subsidiaries operating in Asia include Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL). \n \nAs a result of the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the E.U. (Brexit), we have strengthened the capabilities of our E.U. operating subsidiaries, particularly GSBE, and have moved certain activities there. For example, we have moved a number of relationships with clients of our Investment Banking, Global Markets and Wealth Management businesses from GSI and GSIB to GSBE, and clients of our Asset Management business from GSAMI to GSBE; established access for GSBE to exchanges, clearing houses and depositories and other market infrastructure in the E.U.; established branches of GSBE in several E.U. member states and in the U.K.; and strengthened the capital, personnel and other resources at GSBE. \n \nBanking Supervision and Regulation \n \nGroup Inc. is a BHC under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHC Act) and an FHC under amendments to the BHC Act effected by the U.S. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLB Act), and is subject to supervision and examination by the FRB, which is our primary regulator. \n \nThe FRB\u2019s rating system for large financial institutions is aligned with its supervisory program and is comprised of component ratings for capital planning and positions, liquidity risk management and positions, and governance and controls. \n \nUnder the system of \u201cfunctional regulation\u201d established under the BHC Act, the primary regulators of our U.S. \nnon-bank\n subsidiaries directly regulate the activities of those subsidiaries, with the FRB exercising a supervisory role. Such \u201cfunctionally regulated\u201d subsidiaries include broker-dealers and security-based swap dealers registered with the SEC, such as our principal U.S. broker-dealer, GS&Co., entities registered with or regulated by the CFTC with respect to futures-related and swaps-related activities and investment advisers registered with the SEC with respect to their investment advisory activities. \n \n \n \nOur principal U.S. bank subsidiary, GS Bank USA, is supervised and regulated by the FRB, the FDIC, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). GS Bank USA also has a London branch, which is regulated by the FCA and PRA, and a Tokyo branch, which is regulated by the Japan Financial Services Agency. We conduct a number of our activities partially or entirely through GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries, including: corporate loans (including leveraged lending) and transaction banking; consumer loans (including installment and credit card loans); small business loans (including installment, lines of credit and credit cards); wealth management loans (including mortgages); interest rate, credit, currency and other derivatives; deposit-taking; and agency lending. \n \nOur E.U. subsidiaries are subject to various E.U. regulations, as well as national laws, including those implementing European directives. GSBE is directly supervised by the European Central Bank (ECB) and additionally by BaFin and Deutsche Bundesbank in the context of the E.U. Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). GSBE\u2019s London branch is regulated by the FCA. GSBE engages in certain activities primarily in the E.U., including underwriting and market making in debt and equity securities and derivatives, investment, asset and wealth management services, deposit-taking, lending (including securities lending), and financial advisory services and is a primary dealer for government bonds issued by E.U. sovereigns. On July\u00a01,\u00a02021, GSBE became a subsidiary of GS Bank USA. As a foreign bank subsidiary of GS Bank USA, GSBE is subject to limits on the nature and scope of its activities under the FRB\u2019s Regulation K, including limits on its underwriting and market making in equity securities based on GSBE\u2019s and/or GS Bank USA\u2019s capital. \n \nGoldman Sachs Paris Inc. et Cie (GSPIC) is an investment firm regulated by the French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority and the Financial Markets Authority. GSPIC\u2019s activities include certain activities that GSBE is prevented from undertaking. GSPIC applied in October\u00a02021 to become a credit institution. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n11\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nOur principal subsidiaries in the U.K. include GSI, a U.K. broker-dealer and a designated investment firm, and GSIB, a U.K. bank. Both GSI and GSIB are regulated by the PRA and the FCA. As an investment firm, GSI is subject to prudential requirements applicable to banks, including capital and liquidity requirements. GSI provides broker-dealer services in and from the U.K. and is registered with the CFTC as a swap dealer and with the SEC as a securities-based swap dealer. GSIB engages in lending (including securities lending) and deposit-taking activities and is a primary dealer for U.K. government bonds. GSI and GSIB maintain branches outside of the U.K. and are subject to the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions where they are located. \n \nCapital and Liquidity Requirements.\n We and GS Bank USA are subject to regulatory risk-based capital and leverage requirements that are calculated in accordance with the regulations of the FRB (Capital Framework). The Capital Framework is largely based on the Basel Committee\u2019s framework for strengthening the regulation, supervision and risk management of banks (Basel\u00a0III) and also implements certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies\u2019 tailoring framework, we and GS Bank USA are subject to \u201cCategory I\u201d standards because we have been designated as a global systemically important bank \n(G-SIB).\n Accordingly, we and GS Bank USA are \u201cAdvanced approach\u201d banking organizations. Under the Capital Framework, we and GS Bank USA must meet specific regulatory capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain \noff-balance\n sheet items. The sufficiency of our capital levels is also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. We and GS Bank USA are also subject to liquidity requirements established by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. \n \nGSBE is subject to capital and liquidity requirements prescribed in the E.U. Capital Requirements Regulation, as amended (CRR), and the E.U. Capital Requirements Directive, as amended (CRD), which are largely based on Basel\u00a0III. \n \nThe most recent previous amendments to the CRR and CRD\u00a0(respectively, CRR II and CRD\u00a0V) include changes to the market risk, counterparty credit risk, large exposures and leverage ratio frameworks. These changes have been applicable in the E.U. since June\u00a02021. \n \nGSI and GSIB are subject to the U.K. capital and liquidity frameworks, which are also largely based on Basel\u00a0III and remain predominantly aligned with the E.U. capital and liquidity frameworks. Amendments similar to CRR II and CRD\u00a0V became applicable in the U.K. on January\u00a01,\u00a02022. Requirements established by E.U. and U.K. authorities are therefore similar to those applicable to GS Bank USA and us. \n \n \n \nRisk-Based Capital Ratios.\n As Advanced approach banking organizations, we and GS Bank USA calculate risk-based capital ratios in accordance with both the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules. Both the Advanced Capital Rules and the Standardized Capital Rules include minimum risk-based capital requirements and additional capital conservation buffer requirements that must be satisfied solely with Common Equity Tier\u00a01 (CET1) capital. Failure to satisfy a buffer requirement in full would result in constraints on capital distributions and discretionary executive compensation. The severity of the constraints would depend on the amount of the shortfall and the organization\u2019s \u201celigible retained income,\u201d defined as the greater of (i)\u00a0net income for the four preceding quarters, net of distributions and associated tax effects not reflected in net income; and (ii)\u00a0the average of net income over the preceding four quarters. For Group Inc., the capital conservation buffer requirements consist of a 2.5% buffer (under the Advanced Capital Rules), a stress capital buffer (SCB) (under the Standardized Capital Rules), and both a countercyclical buffer and the \nG-SIB\n surcharge (under both Capital Rules). For GS Bank USA, the capital conservation buffer requirements consist of a 2.5% buffer and the countercyclical capital buffer. \n \nThe SCB is based on the results of the Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory stress tests and our planned common stock dividends and is likely to change over time based on the results of the annual supervisory stress tests. See \u201cStress Tests and Capital Planning\u201d below. The countercyclical capital buffer is designed to counteract systemic vulnerabilities and currently applies only to banking organizations subject to Category I, II or III standards, including us and GS Bank USA. Several other national supervisors also require countercyclical capital buffers. The \nG-SIB\n surcharge and countercyclical capital buffer applicable to us may change in the future including due to additional guidance from our regulators and/or positional changes. As a result, the minimum capital ratios to which we are subject are likely to change over time. \n \nThe U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have a rule that implements the Basel Committee\u2019s standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk exposures in connection with derivative contracts \n(SA-CCR).\n Under the rule, \u201cAdvanced approach\u201d banking organizations are required to use \nSA-CCR\n for calculating their standardized risk-weighted assets (RWAs) and, with some adjustments, for purposes of determining their supplementary leverage ratios (SLRs) discussed below. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The CRD\u00a0and CRR provide that institutions that are systemically important at the E.U. or member state level, known as other systemically important institutions \n(O-SIIs),\n may be subject to additional capital ratio requirements, according to their degree of systemic importance \n(O-SII\n buffers). In 2021, BaFin identified GSBE as an \nO-SII\n in Germany and set an \nO-SII\n buffer, applicable from January\u00a01,\u00a02022. \n \nIn the U.K., the PRA has identified Goldman Sachs Group UK Limited (GSG UK), the parent company of GSI and GSIB, as an \nO-SII\n but has not applied an \nO-SII\n buffer. \n \nThe Basel Committee has finalized revisions to the framework for calculating capital requirements for market risk as part of its Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB). These revisions are expected to increase market risk capital requirements for most banking organizations and large broker-dealers subject to bank capital requirements. The revised framework, among other things, revises the standardized and internal model-based approaches used to calculate market risk requirements and clarifies the scope of positions subject to market risk capital requirements. The Basel Committee framework contemplates that national regulators implement the revised framework by January\u00a01,\u00a02023. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have not yet proposed rules implementing the revised framework. Under the CRR, E.U. financial institutions commenced reporting their market risk calculations under the revised framework in the third quarter of 2021. U.K. authorities have not yet proposed rules to implement this framework. \n \n \n \nThe Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel\u00a0III post-crisis regulatory reforms (Basel\u00a0III Revisions). These standards set a floor on internally modeled capital requirements at a percentage of the capital requirements under the standardized approach. They also revise the Basel Committee\u2019s standardized and internal model-based approaches for credit risk, provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital and revise the frameworks for credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk. The Basel Committee framework contemplates that national regulators implement these standards by January\u00a01,\u00a02023, and that the new floor be phased in through January\u00a01,\u00a02028. In July\u00a02020, the Basel Committee finalized further revisions to the framework for CVA risk, which are intended to align that framework with the market risk framework. \n \nThe U.S. federal bank regulatory authorities have not yet proposed rules implementing the Basel\u00a0III Revisions for purposes of their risk-based capital ratios. The European Commission proposed rules to implement the Basel\u00a0III Revisions in October\u00a02021. The proposed E.U. rules contemplate amendments to the CRR and the CRD, referred to as CRR III and CRD\u00a0VI, to take effect in January\u00a02025. The U.K. authorities have not yet released a proposal on the Basel\u00a0III Revisions. \n \nThe Basel Committee has also published an updated securitization framework and a revised \nG-SIB\n assessment methodology, but the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have not yet proposed rules implementing them. The updated securitization framework has been implemented in the E.U. and U.K. \n \nLeverage Ratios.\n Under the Capital Framework, we and GS Bank USA are subject to Tier\u00a01 leverage ratios and SLRs established by the FRB. As a \nG-SIB,\n the SLR requirements applicable to us include both a minimum requirement and a buffer requirement, which operates in the same manner as the risk-based buffer requirements described above. In April\u00a02018, the FRB and the OCC issued a proposed rule which would (i)\u00a0replace the current 2% SLR buffer for \nG-SIBs,\n including us, with a buffer equal to 50% of their \nG-SIB\n surcharge and (ii)\u00a0revise the 6% SLR requirement for Category I banks, such as GS Bank USA, to be \u201cwell capitalized\u201d with a requirement equal to 3% plus 50% of their parent\u2019s \nG-SIB\n surcharge. This proposal, together with the adopted rule requiring use of \nSA-CCR\n for purposes of calculating the SLR, would implement certain of the revisions to the leverage ratio framework published by the Basel Committee in December\u00a02017. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n13\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nGSBE and certain of our U.K. entities, including GSI and GSIB, are also subject to requirements relating to leverage ratios, which are generally based on the Basel Committee leverage ratio standards. \n \nSee \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u00a0\u2014 Capital Management and Regulatory Capital\u201d in Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a07 of this \nForm\u00a010-K\n and Note\u00a020 to the consolidated financial statements in Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a08 of this \nForm\u00a010-K\n for information about our and GS Bank USA\u2019s Tier\u00a01 leverage ratios and SLRs, and GSI\u2019s leverage ratio. \n \nLiquidity Ratios.\n The Basel Committee\u2019s framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring requires banking organizations to measure their liquidity against two specific liquidity tests: the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). \n \nThe LCR rule issued by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies and applicable to both us and GS Bank USA is generally consistent with the Basel Committee\u2019s framework and is designed to ensure that a banking organization maintains an adequate level of unencumbered, high-quality liquid assets equal to or greater than the expected net cash outflows under an acute short-term liquidity stress scenario. We and GS Bank USA are required to maintain a minimum LCR of 100%. See \u201cAvailable Information\u201d below and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u00a0\u2014 Capital Management and Regulatory Capital\u201d in Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a07 of this \nForm\u00a010-K\n for information about our average daily LCR. \n \nGSBE is subject to the LCR rule issued by the European Commission, and GSI and GSIB are subject to the U.K. prudential framework\u2019s LCR rules. These rules are generally consistent with the Basel Committee\u2019s framework. \n \nThe NSFR is designed to promote medium- and long-term stable funding of the assets and \noff-balance\n sheet activities of banking organizations over a \none-year\n time horizon. The Basel Committee\u2019s NSFR framework requires banking organizations to maintain a minimum NSFR of 100%. \n \n \n \nThe U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule, which became effective in July\u00a02021, implementing the NSFR for large U.S. banking organizations, including us and GS Bank USA. We will be required to publicly disclose our quarterly average daily NSFR semiannually beginning in 2023. The CRR implemented the NSFR for certain E.U. financial institutions, including GSBE, which became effective in June\u00a02021. The NSFR requirement implemented in the U.K. became effective in January\u00a02022 and is applicable to both GSI and GSIB. \n \nThe FRB\u2019s enhanced prudential standards require BHCs with $100\u00a0billion or more in total consolidated assets to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk management standards, which include maintaining a level of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs for 30\u00a0days, and increased involvement by boards of directors in liquidity and overall risk management. Although the liquidity requirement under these rules has some similarities to the LCR, it is a separate requirement. GSBE also has its own liquidity planning process, which incorporates internally designed stress tests and those required under German regulatory requirements and the ECB Guide to Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP). GSI and GSIB have their own liquidity planning processes, which incorporate internally designed stress tests developed in accordance with the guidelines of the PRA\u2019s ILAAP. \n \nSee \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u00a0\u2014 Risk Management\u00a0\u2014 Overview and Structure of Risk Management\u201d and \u201c\u2014 Liquidity Risk Management\u201d in Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a07 of this \nForm\u00a010-K\n for information about the LCR and NSFR, as well as our risk management practices and liquidity. \n \nStress Tests and Capital Planning.\n The FRB\u2019s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) is designed to ensure that large BHCs, including us, have sufficient capital to permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress. As required by the FRB, we perform an annual capital stress test and incorporate the results into an annual capital plan, which we submit to the FRB for review. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u00a0\u2014 Risk Management\u00a0\u2014 Overview and Structure of Risk Management\u00a0\u2014 Capital Risk Management\u201d in Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a07 of this \nForm\u00a010-K\n for further information about our annual capital plan.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nThe FRB\u2019s rule applicable to BHCs with $100\u00a0billion or more in total consolidated assets, including us, replaced the static 2.5% component of the capital conservation buffer required under the Standardized Capital Rules with the SCB. The SCB reflects stressed losses estimated under the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the CCAR stress tests, as calculated by the FRB, and includes four quarters of planned common stock dividends. The SCB, which is subject to a 2.5% floor, is generally effective on October\u00a01 of each year and remains in effect until October\u00a01 of the following year, unless it is reset in connection with the resubmission of a capital plan. See \u201cAvailable Information\u201d below and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u00a0\u2014 Capital Management and Regulatory Capital\u201d in Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a07 of this \nForm\u00a010-K\n for information about our SCB requirement. \n \nThe final rule implementing the SCB requires a BHC to receive the FRB\u2019s approval for any dividend, stock repurchase or other capital distribution, other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument, if the BHC is required to resubmit its capital plan. \n \nU.S. depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $250\u00a0billion or more that are subsidiaries of U.S. \nG-SIBs\n are required to submit annual \ncompany-run\n stress test results to the FRB. As a result of recent growth in its balance sheet, GS Bank USA will be required to submit its annual stress test results in 2022. GSBE also has its own capital and stress testing process, which incorporates internally designed stress tests and those required under German regulatory requirements and the ECB Guide to Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). In addition, GSI and GSIB have their own capital planning and stress testing processes, which incorporate internally designed stress tests developed in accordance with the PRA\u2019s ICAAP guidelines. \n \n \n \nU.S. federal and state laws impose limitations on the payment of dividends by U.S. depository institutions, such as GS Bank USA. In general, the amount of dividends that may be paid by GS Bank USA is limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a recent earnings test and an undivided profits test. Under the recent earnings test, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by the entity in any calendar year is in excess of the current year\u2019s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years, unless the entity obtains regulatory approval. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entity\u2019s undivided profits (generally, accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus), unless the entity receives regulatory and stockholder approval. As a result of dividend payments from GS Bank USA to Group Inc. in connection with the acquisition of GSBE in July\u00a02021, GS Bank USA cannot currently declare any dividends without regulatory approval. \n \nThe applicable U.S. banking regulators have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends if, in the banking regulator\u2019s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization. \n \nSource of Strength.\n The Dodd-Frank Act requires BHCs to act as a source of strength to their U.S. bank subsidiaries and to commit capital and financial resources to support those subsidiaries. This support may be required by the FRB at times when BHCs might otherwise determine not to provide it. Capital loans by a BHC to a U.S. subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. In addition, if a BHC commits to a U.S. federal banking agency that it will maintain the capital of its bank subsidiary, whether in response to the FRB\u2019s invoking its \nsource-of-strength\n authority or in response to other regulatory measures, that commitment will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee for the BHC and the bank will be entitled to priority payment in respect of that commitment, ahead of other creditors of the BHC. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n15\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nTransactions Between Affiliates.\n Transactions between GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries, including GSBE, and Group Inc. or its other subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to restrictions under the Federal Reserve Act and regulations issued by the FRB. These laws and regulations generally limit the types and amounts of transactions (such as loans and other credit extensions, including credit exposure arising from resale agreements, securities borrowing and derivative transactions, from GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries to Group Inc. or its other subsidiaries and affiliates and purchases of assets by GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries from Group Inc. or its other subsidiaries and affiliates) that may take place and generally require those transactions, to the extent permitted, to be on market terms or better to GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries. These laws and regulations generally do not apply to transactions between GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries. Similarly, German regulatory requirements provide that certain transactions between GSBE and GS Bank USA or its other affiliates, including Group Inc., must be on market terms and are subject to special internal approval requirements. PRA rules provide similar requirements for transactions between GSI and GSIB and their respective affiliates. \n \nThe BHC Act prohibits the FRB from requiring a payment by a BHC subsidiary to a depository institution if the functional regulator of that subsidiary objects to the payment. In that case, the FRB could instead require the divestiture of the depository institution and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture. \n \nResolution and Recovery Plans.\n We are required by the FRB and the FDIC to submit a periodic plan for our rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure (resolution plan). If these regulators jointly determine that an institution has failed to remediate identified shortcomings in its resolution plan or that its resolution plan, after any permitted resubmission, is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, they may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth, activities or operations, or may jointly order the institution to divest assets or operations, in order to facilitate orderly resolution in the event of failure. The FRB and FDIC have a rule requiring U.S. \nG-SIBs\n to submit resolution plans on a \ntwo-year\n cycle (alternating between full and targeted submissions). We submitted our 2021 resolution plan, which was a targeted submission, in June\u00a02021. Our next required submission is a full submission by July\u00a01,\u00a02023. See \u201cRisk Factors\u00a0\u2014 The application of Group Inc.\u2019s proposed resolution strategy could result in greater losses for Group Inc.\u2019s security holders\u201d in Part\u00a0I, Item\u00a01A of this \nForm\u00a010-K\n and \u201cAvailable Information\u201d in Part\u00a0I, Item\u00a01 of this \nForm\u00a010-K\n for further information about our resolution plan. \n \n \n \nWe are also required by the FRB to submit, on a periodic basis, a global recovery plan that outlines the steps that we could take to reduce risk, maintain sufficient liquidity and conserve capital in times of prolonged stress. Certain of our subsidiaries are also subject to similar recovery plan requirements. \n \nThe FDIC has issued a rule requiring each insured depository institution (IDI) with $50\u00a0billion or more in assets, such as GS Bank USA, to provide a resolution plan. Our resolution plan for GS Bank USA must, among other things, demonstrate that it is adequately protected from risks arising from our other entities. GS Bank USA\u2019s most recent resolution plan was submitted in June\u00a02018. In January\u00a02021, the FDIC announced its intention to require resolution plan submissions for IDIs with $100\u00a0billion or more in assets, including GS Bank USA. In June\u00a02021, the FDIC issued guidance for those resolution plans. This guidance splits covered IDIs into two groups for purposes of the timing of resolution plan submissions, and GS Bank USA is in the second group with a later submission date. \n \nThe U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted rules imposing restrictions on qualified financial contracts (QFCs) entered into by \nG-SIBs.\n The rules are intended to facilitate the orderly resolution of a failed \nG-SIB\n by limiting the ability of the \nG-SIB\n to enter into a QFC unless (i)\u00a0the counterparty waives certain default rights in such contract arising upon the entry of the \nG-SIB\n or one of its affiliates into resolution, (ii)\u00a0the contract does not contain enumerated prohibitions on the transfer of such contract and/or any related credit enhancement, and (iii)\u00a0the counterparty agrees that the contract will be subject to the special resolution regimes set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act orderly liquidation authority (OLA) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950 (FDIA), described below. GS Bank USA has achieved compliance by adhering to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Universal Resolution Stay Protocol (ISDA Universal Protocol) and International Swaps and Derivatives Association 2018 U.S. Resolution Stay Protocol (U.S. ISDA Protocol) described below. \n \nCertain of our subsidiaries also adhere to these protocols. The ISDA Universal Protocol imposes a stay on certain cross-default and early termination rights within standard ISDA derivative contracts and securities financing transactions between adhering parties in the event that one of them is subject to resolution in its home jurisdiction, including a resolution under OLA or the FDIA in the U.S. The U.S. ISDA Protocol, which was based on the ISDA Universal Protocol, was created to allow market participants to comply with the final QFC rules adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nThe E.U. Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), as amended by the BRRD II, establishes a framework for the recovery and resolution of financial institutions in the E.U., such as GSBE. The BRRD provides national supervisory authorities with tools and powers to \npre-emptively\n address potential financial crises in order to promote financial stability and minimize taxpayers\u2019 exposure to losses. The BRRD requires E.U. member states to grant certain resolution powers to national and, where relevant, E.U. resolution authorities, including the power to impose a temporary stay and to recapitalize a failing entity by writing down its unsecured debt or converting its unsecured debt into equity. Financial institutions in the E.U. must provide that contracts governed by \nnon-E.U.\n law recognize those temporary stay and \nbail-in\n powers unless doing so would be impracticable. GSBE is under the direct authority of the Single Resolution Board for resolution planning. Regulatory authorities in the E.U. may require financial institutions in the E.U., including subsidiaries of \nnon-E.U.\n groups, to submit recovery plans and to assist the relevant resolution authority in constructing resolution plans for the E.U. entities. GSBE\u2019s primary regulator with respect to recovery planning is the ECB, and it is also regulated by BaFin and Deutsche Bundesbank. \n \nThe U.K. Special Resolution Regime confers substantially the same powers on the Bank of England, as the U.K. resolution authority, and substantially the same requirements on U.K. financial institutions. Further, certain U.K. financial institutions, including GSI and GSIB, are required to meet the Bank of England\u2019s expectations contained in the U.K. Resolution Assessment Framework, including with respect to loss absorbency, contractual stays, operational continuity and funding in resolution. They are also required by the PRA to submit solvent wind-down plans on how they could be wound down in a stressed environment. The PRA is also the regulatory authority in the U.K. that supervises recovery planning, and GSI and GSIB are each required to submit recovery plans to the PRA. \n \nTotal Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC).\n The FRB has issued a rule addressing U.S. implementation of the Financial Stability Board\u2019s (FSB\u2019s) TLAC principles and term sheet on minimum TLAC requirements for \nG-SIBs.\n The rule (i)\u00a0establishes minimum TLAC requirements; (ii)\u00a0establishes minimum requirements for \u201celigible long-term debt\u201d (i.e., debt that is unsecured, has a maturity of at least one year from issuance and satisfies certain additional criteria); (iii) prohibits certain parent company transactions; and (iv)\u00a0caps the amount of parent company liabilities that are not eligible long-term debt. \n \n \n \nThe rule also prohibits a BHC that has been designated as a U.S. \nG-SIB\n from (i)\u00a0guaranteeing subsidiaries\u2019 liabilities that are subject to early termination provisions if the BHC enters into an insolvency or receivership proceeding, subject to an exception for guarantees permitted by rules of the U.S. federal banking agencies imposing restrictions on QFCs; (ii)\u00a0incurring liabilities guaranteed by subsidiaries; (iii)\u00a0issuing short-term debt to third parties; or (iv)\u00a0entering into derivatives and certain other financial contracts with external counterparties. \n \nAdditionally, the rule caps, at 5% of the value of the parent company\u2019s eligible TLAC, the amount of unsecured \nnon-contingent\n third-party liabilities that are not eligible long-term debt that could rank equally with or junior to eligible long-term debt. \n \nThe FRB, the OCC and the FDIC issued a final rule, effective April\u00a01,\u00a02021, requiring \u201cAdvanced approach\u201d banking organizations, such as us, to deduct from their own regulatory capital certain investments above thresholds in unsecured debt instruments issued by \nG-SIBs,\n including those issued for purposes of satisfying TLAC requirements. \n \nThe CRR and the BRRD are designed to, among other things, implement the FSB\u2019s minimum TLAC requirement for \nG-SIBs.\n For example, the CRR requires E.U. subsidiaries of a \nnon-E.U.\n \nG-SIB\n to meet internal TLAC requirements if they exceed the threshold of 5% of the \nG-SIB\u2019s\n RWAs, operating income or leverage exposure. GSBE does not currently exceed these thresholds. Under the U.K. financial services regime, GSG UK exceeds the applicable thresholds and therefore, it is subject to internal TLAC requirements. \n \nThe CRD\u00a0requires a \nnon-E.U.\n group with more than \u20ac40\u00a0billion of assets in the E.U., such as us, to establish an E.U. intermediate holding company (E.U. IHC) by December\u00a030,\u00a02023 if it has, as in our case, two or more of certain types of E.U. financial institution subsidiaries, including broker-dealers and banks. A \nnon-E.U.\n group may have two E.U. IHCs if a request for a second is approved. The CRR requires E.U. IHCs to satisfy capital and liquidity requirements, a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL), and certain other prudential requirements at a consolidated level. The U.K. has not implemented the requirement for an IHC; however, the PRA has introduced a requirement to approve or exempt certain U.K. financial holding companies, including GSG UK, which became effective in January\u00a02022. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n17\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nThe BRRD II and the U.K. resolution regime subject institutions to an MREL, which is generally consistent with the FSB\u2019s TLAC standard. In June\u00a02018, the Bank of England published a statement of policy on internal MREL, which requires a material U.K. subsidiary of an overseas banking group, such as GSI, to meet a minimum internal MREL requirement to facilitate the transfer of losses to its resolution entity, which for GSI is Group Inc. The transitional minimum internal MREL requirement became fully effective on January\u00a01,\u00a02022. In order to comply with the MREL statement of policy, we have provided the Bank of England the right to exercise \nbail-in\n triggers over certain intercompany regulatory capital and senior debt instruments issued by GSI. These triggers enable the Bank of England to write down such instruments or convert such instruments to equity. The triggers can be exercised by the Bank of England if it determines that GSI has reached the point of \nnon-viability\n and the FRB and the FDIC have not objected to the \nbail-in\n or if Group Inc. enters bankruptcy or similar proceedings. \n \nInsolvency of a BHC or IDI.\n The Dodd-Frank Act created a resolution regime, OLA, for BHCs and their affiliates that are systemically important. Under OLA, the FDIC may be appointed as receiver for the systemically important institution and its failed \nnon-bank\n subsidiaries if, upon the recommendation of applicable regulators, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury determines, among other things, that the institution is in default or in danger of default, that the institution\u2019s failure would have serious adverse effects on the U.S. financial system and that resolution under OLA would avoid or mitigate those effects. \n \nIf the FDIC is appointed as receiver under OLA, then the powers of the receiver, and the rights and obligations of creditors and other parties who have dealt with the institution, would be determined under OLA, and not under the bankruptcy or insolvency law that would otherwise apply. The powers of the receiver under OLA are generally based on the powers of the FDIC as receiver for depository institutions under the FDIA, described below. \n \n \n \nSubstantial differences in the rights of creditors exist between OLA and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC under OLA to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in some circumstances, the use of an administrative claims procedure to determine creditors\u2019 claims (as opposed to the judicial procedure utilized in bankruptcy proceedings), and the right of the FDIC to transfer claims to a \u201cbridge\u201d entity. In addition, OLA limits the ability of creditors to enforce certain contractual cross-defaults against affiliates of the institution in receivership. The FDIC has issued a notice that it would likely resolve a failed FHC by transferring its assets to a \u201cbridge\u201d holding company under its \u201csingle point of entry\u201d or \u201cSPOE\u201d strategy pursuant to OLA. \n \nUnder the FDIA, if the FDIC is appointed as conservator or receiver for an IDI such as GS Bank USA, upon its insolvency or in certain other events, the FDIC has broad powers, including the power: \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nTo transfer any of the IDI\u2019s assets and liabilities to a new obligor, including a newly formed \u201cbridge\u201d bank, without the approval of the depository institution\u2019s creditors; \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nTo enforce the IDI\u2019s contracts pursuant to their terms without regard to any provisions triggered by the appointment of the FDIC in that capacity; or \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nTo repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the IDI is a party, the performance of which is determined by the FDIC to be burdensome and the repudiation or disaffirmance of which is determined by the FDIC to promote the orderly administration of the IDI. \n \n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses against an IDI would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims, including deposits at \nnon-U.S.\n branches and claims of debtholders of the IDI, in the \u201cliquidation or other resolution\u201d of such an institution by any receiver. As a result, whether or not the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of GS Bank USA, the debtholders (other than depositors at U.S. branches) would be treated differently from, and could receive, if anything, substantially less than, the depositors at U.S. branches of GS Bank USA. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nDeposit Insurance.\n Deposits at GS Bank USA have the benefit of FDIC insurance up to the applicable limits. The FDIC\u2019s Deposit Insurance Fund is funded by assessments on IDIs. GS Bank USA\u2019s assessment (subject to adjustment by the FDIC) is currently based on its average total consolidated assets less its average tangible equity during the assessment period, its supervisory ratings and specified forward-looking financial measures used to calculate the assessment rate. The deposits of GSBE are covered by the German statutory deposit protection program to the extent provided by law. In addition, GSBE has elected to participate in the German voluntary deposit protection program which provides insurance for certain eligible deposits not covered by the German statutory deposit program. Deposits at GSIB are covered by the U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme up to the applicable limits. \n \nPrompt Corrective Action. \nThe U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) requires the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies to take \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d in respect of depository institutions that do not meet specified capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital categories for FDIC-insured banks, such as GS Bank USA: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. \n \nAn institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than is indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, as the capital category of an institution declines. Failure to meet the capital requirements could also require a depository institution to raise capital. Ultimately, critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator, as described in \u201cInsolvency of an IDI or a BHC\u201d above. \n \nThe prompt corrective action regulations do not apply to BHCs. However, the FRB is authorized to take appropriate action at the BHC level, based upon the undercapitalized status of the BHC\u2019s depository institution subsidiaries. In certain instances, relating to an undercapitalized depository institution subsidiary, the BHC would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary\u2019s capital restoration plan and might be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitments on that guarantee. Furthermore, in the event of the bankruptcy of the BHC, the guarantee would take priority over the BHC\u2019s general unsecured creditors, as described in \u201cSource of Strength\u201d above. \n \n \n \nVolcker Rule and Other Restrictions on Activities. \nAs a BHC, we are subject to limitations on the types of business activities in which we may engage. \n \nVolcker Rule.\n \nThe Volcker Rule prohibits \u201cproprietary trading,\u201d but permits activities such as underwriting, market making and risk-mitigation hedging, requires an extensive compliance program and includes additional reporting and record-keeping requirements. \n \nIn addition, the Volcker Rule limits the sponsorship of, and investment in, \u201ccovered funds\u201d (as defined in the rule) by banking entities, including us. It also limits certain types of transactions between us and our sponsored and advised funds, similar to the limitations on transactions between depository institutions and their affiliates. Covered funds include our private equity funds, certain of our credit and real estate funds, our hedge funds and certain other investment structures. The limitation on investments in covered funds requires us to limit our investment in each such fund to 3% or less of the fund\u2019s net asset value, and to limit our aggregate investment in all such funds to 3% or less of our Tier\u00a01 capital. \n \nThe FRB has extended the conformance period to July\u00a02022 for our investments in, and relationships with, certain legacy \u201cilliquid funds\u201d (as defined in the Volcker Rule) that were in place prior to December\u00a02013. See Note\u00a08 to the consolidated financial statements in Part\u00a0II, Item 8 of this \nForm\u00a010-K\n for further information about our investments in such funds. \n \nOther Restrictions.\n FHCs generally can engage in a broader range of financial and related activities than are otherwise permissible for BHCs as long as they continue to meet the eligibility requirements for FHCs. The broader range of permissible activities for FHCs includes underwriting, dealing and making markets in securities and making investments in \nnon-FHCs\n (merchant banking activities). In addition, certain FHCs, including us, are permitted to engage in certain commodities activities in the U.S. that may otherwise be impermissible for BHCs, so long as the assets held pursuant to these activities do not equal 5% or more of their consolidated assets. \n \nThe FRB, however, has the authority to limit an FHC\u2019s ability to conduct activities that would otherwise be permissible, and will likely do so if the FHC does not satisfactorily meet certain requirements of the FRB. For example, if an FHC or any of its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries ceases to maintain its status as well-capitalized or well-managed, the FRB may impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements, as well as additional limitations or conditions. If the deficiencies persist, the FHC may be required to divest its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries or to cease engaging in activities other than the business of banking and certain closely related activities. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n19\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nIf any IDI subsidiary of an FHC fails to maintain at least a \u201csatisfactory\u201d rating under the Community Reinvestment Act, the FHC would be subject to restrictions on certain new activities and acquisitions. \n \nIn addition, we are required to obtain prior FRB approval before certain acquisitions and before engaging in certain banking and other financial activities both within and outside the U.S. \n \nThe FRB issued a proposed rule in September\u00a02016 which, if adopted, would impose new requirements on the physical commodity activities and certain merchant banking activities of FHCs, including, among other things, additional capital requirements, stringent quantitative limits on permissible physical trading activity, and new public reporting requirements. At that time, the FRB recommended that Congress repeal authorities for FHCs to engage in merchant banking activities and for certain FHCs to engage in certain otherwise impermissible commodities activities. \n \nU.S. \nG-SIBs,\n like us, are also required to comply with a rule regarding single counterparty credit limits, which imposes more stringent requirements for credit exposures among major financial institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires the FRB to implement early remediation requirements, which were proposed in 2011 but not finalized. \n \nThe New York State banking law imposes lending limits (which take into account credit exposure from derivative transactions) and other requirements that could impact the manner and scope of GS Bank USA\u2019s activities. \n \nThe U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have issued guidance that focuses on transaction structures and risk management frameworks and that outlines high-level principles for \nsafe-and-sound\n leveraged lending, including underwriting standards, valuation and stress testing. This guidance has, among other things, limited the percentage amount of debt that can be included in certain transactions. \n \nAs a German credit institution, GSBE will become subject to Volcker Rule-type prohibitions under German banking law and regulations once its financial assets exceed certain thresholds. Prohibited activities will then include proprietary trading, certain types of high-frequency trading and certain types of lending and guarantee businesses with defined prohibited counterparties, such as hedge funds and other highly leveraged funds, unless an exclusion or an exemption applies. See \u201cVolcker Rule\u201d above for further information. \n \n \n \nU.K. banks that have over \u00a325\u00a0billion of core retail deposits are required to separate their retail banking services from their investment and international banking activities, commonly known as \u201cring-fencing.\u201d GSIB is not currently subject to the ring-fencing requirement, and if it were to become subject to it, GSIB would need to make significant operational and structural changes. \n \nBroker-Dealer and Securities Regulation \n \nOur broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including sales methods, trade practices, the use and safekeeping of clients\u2019 funds and securities, capital structure, record-keeping, the financing of clients\u2019 purchases, and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. In the U.S., the SEC is the federal agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws. GS&Co. is registered as a broker-dealer, a securities-based swap dealer, a municipal advisor and an investment adviser with the SEC and as a broker-dealer in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. U.S. self-regulatory organizations, such as FINRA and the NYSE, adopt rules that apply to, and examine, broker-dealers such as GS&Co. \n \nU.S. state securities and other U.S. regulators also have regulatory or oversight authority over GS&Co. For a description of net capital requirements applicable to GS&Co., see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u00a0\u2014 Capital Management and Regulatory Capital\u00a0\u2014 U.S. Regulated Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries\u201d in Part\u00a0II, Item 7 of this \nForm\u00a010-K.\n \n \nThe SEC issued a proposed rule in November 2021 which, if adopted, would require lenders of securities to provide the material terms of securities lending transactions to a registered national securities association, such as FINRA. \n \nIn Europe, we provide broker-dealer services, including through GSBE (which is a credit institution), GSPIC and GSI, that are subject to oversight by European and national regulators. These services are regulated in accordance with E.U., U.K. and national laws and regulations. These laws require, among other things, compliance with certain capital adequacy and liquidity standards, customer protection requirements and market conduct and trade reporting rules. Certain of our European subsidiaries are also regulated by the securities, derivatives and commodities exchanges of which they are members. \n \nGSJCL, our regulated Japanese broker-dealer, is subject to capital requirements imposed by Japan\u2019s Financial Services Agency. GSJCL is also regulated by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance, among others. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

As a market maker on exchanges, we are required to maintain orderly markets in the securities to which we are assigned. \n \nIn the E.U. and the U.K., the European Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID\u00a0II) includes extensive market structure reforms, such as the establishment of new trading venue categories for the purposes of discharging the obligation to trade OTC derivatives on a trading platform and enhanced \npre-\n and post-trade transparency covering a wider range of financial instruments. In equities, MiFID II introduced volume caps on \nnon-transparent\n liquidity trading for trading venues, limited the use of broker-dealer crossing networks and created a new regime for systematic internalizers, which are investment firms that execute client transactions outside a trading venue. Additional control requirements were introduced for algorithmic trading, high frequency trading and direct electronic access. Commodities trading firms are required to calculate their positions and adhere to specific position limits. Other reforms include enhanced transaction reporting, the publication of best execution data by investment firms and trading venues, transparency on costs and charges of service to investors, changes to the way investment managers can pay for the receipt of investment research, rules limiting the payment and receipt of soft commissions and other forms of inducements, and mandatory unbundling for broker-dealers between execution and other major services. \n \nThe SEC requires broker-dealers to act in the best interest of their customers. Additionally, SEC rules require broker-dealers to provide a standardized, short-form disclosure highlighting services offered, applicable standards of conduct, fees and costs, the differences between brokerage and advisory services, and any conflicts of interest. Several states have adopted or proposed adopting uniform fiduciary duty standards applicable to broker-dealers. \n \n \n \nThe SEC, FINRA and regulators in various \nnon-U.S.\n jurisdictions have imposed both conduct-based and disclosure-based requirements with respect to research reports and research analysts and may impose additional regulations. \n \nGS&Co., GS Bank USA and other U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to rules adopted by U.S. federal agencies pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act that require any person who organizes or initiates certain asset-backed securities transactions to retain a portion (generally, at least five percent) of any credit risk that the person conveys to a third party. For certain securitization transactions, retention by third-party purchasers may satisfy this requirement. Certain of our \nnon-U.S.\n subsidiaries, including GSI, are subject to risk retention requirements in connection with securitization activities. \n \nSwaps, Derivatives and Commodities Regulation \n \nThe commodity futures, commodity options and swaps industry in the U.S. is subject to regulation under the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). The CFTC is the U.S. federal agency charged with the administration of the CEA. In addition, the SEC is the U.S. federal agency charged with the regulation of security-based swaps. The rules and regulations of various self-regulatory organizations, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, other futures exchanges and the National Futures Association, also govern commodity futures, commodity options and swaps activities. \n \nThe terms \u201cswaps\u201d and \u201csecurity-based swaps\u201d include a wide variety of derivative instruments in addition to those conventionally referred to as swaps (including certain forward contracts and options), and relate to a wide variety of underlying assets or obligations, including currencies, commodities, interest or other monetary rates, yields, indices, securities, credit events, loans and other financial obligations. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n21\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nCFTC rules require registration of swap dealers, mandatory clearing and execution of interest rate and credit default swaps and real-time public reporting and adherence to business conduct standards for all \nin-scope\n swaps. A number of these requirements, particularly those regarding recordkeeping and reporting, also apply to transactions that do not involve a registered swap dealer. GS&Co. and other subsidiaries, including GS Bank USA, GSBE, GSI and J. Aron, are registered with the CFTC as swap dealers. CFTC rules establishing capital requirements for swap dealers that are not subject to the capital rules of a prudential regulator, such as the FRB, became effective in October\u00a02021. The CFTC has also adopted financial reporting requirements for covered swap entities and amended existing capital rules for CFTC-registered futures commission merchants to provide explicit capital requirements for proprietary positions in swaps and security-based swaps that are not cleared by a clearing organization. Certain of our registered swap dealers, including J. Aron, are subject to the CFTC\u2019s capital requirements. \n \nOur affiliates registered as swap dealers are subject to the margin rules issued by the CFTC (in the case of our \nnon-bank\n swap dealers) and the FRB (in the case of GS Bank USA and GSBE). The rules for variation margin have become effective, and those for initial margin are in the process of being phased in through September\u00a02022, depending on certain activity levels of the swap dealer and the relevant counterparty. Inter-affiliate transactions under the CFTC and FRB margin rules are generally exempt from initial margin requirements. \n \nSEC rules govern the registration and regulation of security-based swap dealers. Security-based swaps are defined as swaps on single securities, single loans or narrow-based baskets or indices of securities. The SEC has adopted a number of rules for security-based swap dealers, including (i)\u00a0capital, margin and segregation requirements; (ii)\u00a0record-keeping, financial reporting and notification requirements; (iii)\u00a0business conduct standards; (iv)\u00a0regulatory and public trade reporting; and (v)\u00a0the application of risk mitigation techniques to uncleared portfolios of security-based swaps. The compliance date for these SEC rules, as well as SEC rules addressing registration requirements and business conduct standards, was generally October\u00a02021. In the fourth quarter of 2021, certain of our subsidiaries, including GS&Co., registered with the SEC as security-based swap dealers and became subject to the SEC\u2019s regulations regarding security-based swaps. The SEC has recently proposed additional regulations regarding security-based swaps that would, among other things, require public reporting of large positions in security-based swaps. \n \n \n \nThe CFTC and the SEC have adopted rules relating to cross-border regulation of swaps, securities-based swaps, business conduct and registration requirements. The CFTC and the SEC have entered into agreements with certain \nnon-U.S.\n regulators regarding the cross-border regulation of derivatives and the mutual recognition of cross-border execution facilities and clearing houses, and have approved substituted compliance with certain \nnon-U.S.\n regulations related to certain business conduct requirements and margin rules. The U.S. prudential regulators have not yet made a determination with respect to substituted compliance for transactions subject to \nnon-U.S.\n margin rules. \n \nSimilar types of regulation have been proposed or adopted in jurisdictions outside the U.S., including in the E.U. and Japan. Under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), for example, the E.U. and the U.K. have established regulatory requirements relating to portfolio reconciliation and reporting, clearing certain OTC derivatives and margining for uncleared derivatives activities. In addition, under the European Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Regulation, transactions in certain types of derivatives are required to be executed on regulated platforms or exchanges. \n \nThe CFTC has adopted rules that limit the size of positions in physical commodity derivatives that can be held by any entity, or any group of affiliates or other parties trading under common ownership or control. Swap dealers may currently claim an exemption from the position limits for the bona fide hedging of swap-related risks, but this exemption will be eliminated in 2023. The CFTC position limits apply to futures on physical commodities and options on such futures, and these limits apply to both physically and cash settled positions. In addition, in 2023, the position limit rules will become applicable to swaps that are economically equivalent to such futures and options. The position limit rules initially impose limits in the spot month only (i.e., during the delivery period for the physical commodities, which is typically a period of several days). CFTC spot and non- spot month limits will continue to apply to futures on certain legacy agricultural commodities, and it is possible that \nnon-spot\n month limits will at some point be adopted for other categories of commodities. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Goldman Sachs Financial Markets, L.P. is registered with the SEC as an OTC derivatives dealer. \n \nAsset Management and Wealth Management Regulation \n \nOur asset management and wealth management businesses are subject to extensive oversight by regulators around the world relating to, among other things, the fair treatment of clients, safeguarding of client assets, offerings of funds, marketing activities, transactions among affiliates and our management of client funds. \n \nInterpretations issued by the SEC clarify the SEC\u2019s views of the existing fiduciary duty owed by investment advisers to their clients. Additionally, SEC rules require investment advisers to provide a standardized, short-form disclosure highlighting services offered, applicable standards of conduct, fees and costs, the differences between brokerage and advisory services, and any conflicts of interest. Several states have adopted or proposed adopting uniform fiduciary duty standards applicable to advisers. \n \nCertain of our European subsidiaries, including GSBE in the E.U. and GSAMI in the U.K., are subject to MiFID\u00a0II and/or related regulations (including the U.K. legislation making such regulations part of U.K. law), which govern the approval, organizational, marketing and reporting requirements of U.K. or E.U.-based investment managers and the ability of investment fund managers located outside the E.U. or the U.K. to access those markets. Our asset management business in the U.K. and the E.U. significantly depends on our ability to delegate parts of our activities to other affiliates. \n \n \n \nOn January\u00a01,\u00a02022, GSAMI became subject to a new prudential regime for U.K. investment firms, the Investment Firms Prudential Regime (IFPR), which governs the prudential requirements for U.K. investment firms prudentially regulated by the FCA. \n \nConsumer Regulation \n \nOur U.S. consumer-oriented activities are subject to supervision and regulation by the CFPB with respect to federal consumer protection laws, including laws relating to fair lending and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products and services. Our consumer-oriented activities are also subject to various state and local consumer protection laws, rules and regulations, which, among other things, impose obligations relating to marketing, origination, servicing and collections activities in our consumer businesses. Many of these laws, rules and regulations also apply to our small business lending activities, which are also subject to supervision and regulation by federal and state regulators. In addition, our U.K. consumer deposit-taking activities are subject to consumer protection regulations. \n \nCompensation Practices \n \nOur compensation practices are subject to oversight by the FRB and, with respect to some of our subsidiaries and employees, by other regulatory bodies worldwide. \n \nThe FSB has released standards for implementation by local regulators that are designed to encourage sound compensation practices at banks and other financial companies. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have also provided guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at banking organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices. The guidance sets forth the following three key principles with respect to incentive compensation arrangements: (i)\u00a0the arrangements should provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk; (ii)\u00a0the arrangements should be compatible with effective controls and risk management; and (iii)\u00a0the arrangements should be supported by strong corporate governance. The guidance provides that supervisory findings with respect to incentive compensation will be incorporated, as appropriate, into the organization\u2019s supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. The guidance also notes that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk management, control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization\u2019s safety and soundness. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n23\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires U.S. financial regulators, including the FRB and SEC, to adopt rules on incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1\u00a0billion in total assets. The U.S. financial regulators proposed revised rules in 2016, which have not been finalized. \n \nThe NYDFS\u2019 guidance emphasizes that any incentive compensation arrangements tied to employee performance indicators at banking institutions regulated by the NYDFS, including GS Bank USA, must be subject to effective risk management, oversight and control. \n \nIn the E.U., certain provisions in the CRR and CRD\u00a0are designed to meet the FSB\u2019s compensation standards. These provisions limit the ratio of variable to fixed compensation of all employees at GSBE and of certain employees at our other operating subsidiaries in the E.U., including those employees identified as having a material impact on the risk profile of regulated entities. CRR II and CRD\u00a0V amended certain aspects of these rules, including, by increasing minimum variable compensation deferral periods. Substantially similar requirements apply in the U.K. in relation to GSI and GSIB. \n \nThe E.U. has also introduced rules regulating compensation for certain persons providing services to certain investment funds. \n \nAnti-Money Laundering and Anti-Bribery Rules and Regulations \n \nThe U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, as amended (BSA), including by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and authorizes or mandates the promulgation of various regulations applicable to financial institutions, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and obligations to monitor client transactions and report suspicious activities. Through these and other provisions, the BSA seeks, among other things, to promote the identification of parties that may be involved in terrorism, money laundering or other suspicious activities. \n \n \n \nThe Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (AMLA), which amends the BSA, was enacted in January\u00a02021. The AMLA is intended to comprehensively reform and modernize U.S. anti-money laundering laws. Among other things, the AMLA codifies a risk-based approach to anti-money laundering compliance for financial institutions; requires the U.S. Department of the Treasury to promulgate priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy; requires the development of standards by the U.S. Department of the Treasury for testing technology and internal processes for BSA compliance; expands enforcement- and investigation-related authority, including a significant expansion in the available sanctions for certain BSA violations; and expands BSA whistleblower incentives and protections. Many of the statutory provisions in the AMLA will require additional rulemakings, reports and other measures, and the impact of the AMLA will depend on, among other things, rulemaking and implementation guidance. In June\u00a02021, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Department of Treasury, issued the priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy, as required under the AMLA. The priorities include: corruption, cybercrime, terrorist financing, fraud, transnational crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking and proliferation financing. \n \nWe are subject to other laws and regulations worldwide relating to anti-money laundering and financial transparency, including the E.U.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nPrivacy and Cyber Security Regulation \n \nOur businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the privacy of information regarding clients, employees and others. These include the GLB Act, the E.U.\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the U.K.\u2019s Data Protection Act 2018, the Japanese Personal Information Protection Act, the Personal Information Protection Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PIPL), the Hong Kong Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA). The GDPR has heightened our privacy compliance obligations, impacted certain of our businesses\u2019 collection, processing and retention of personal data and imposed strict standards for reporting data breaches. The GDPR also provides for significant penalties for \nnon-compliance.\n In addition, the CCPA imposes compliance obligations with regard to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. The CCPA was amended in 2020 by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which, among other things, will expand the scope of data subject to the CCPA when the CPRA becomes effective on January\u00a01,\u00a02023. In addition, several other states and \nnon-U.S.\n jurisdictions have enacted, or are proposing, privacy and data protection laws similar to the GDPR and the CCPA. The PIPL, which went into effect on November\u00a01,\u00a02021, limits the legal bases for processing personal information, contains heightened notice and consent requirements for the handling of certain types of personal information and imposes special cross-border data transfer rules under certain circumstances. \n \nThe NYDFS also requires financial institutions regulated by the NYDFS, including GS Bank USA, to, among other things, (i)\u00a0establish and maintain a cyber security program designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of their information systems; (ii)\u00a0implement and maintain a written cyber security policy setting forth policies and procedures for the protection of their information systems and nonpublic information; and (iii)\u00a0designate a Chief Information Security Officer. \n \nIn November\u00a02021, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies adopted a rule regarding notification requirements for banking organizations related to significant computer-security incidents. Under the final rule, a BHC or state member bank, such as Group Inc. or GS Bank USA, is required to notify its primary regulator within 36\u00a0hours of incidents that have materially disrupted or degraded, or are reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, the banking organization\u2019s ability to deliver services to a material portion of its customer base, jeopardize the viability of key operations of the banking organization, or pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States. The rule is effective April\u00a01,\u00a02022, with compliance required by May\u00a01,\u00a02022. \n \n \n \nInformation about our Executive Officers \n \nSet forth below are the name, age, present title, principal occupation and certain biographical information for the executive officers who have been appointed by, and serve at the pleasure of, Group Inc.\u2019s Board. \n \nPhilip R.

These conditions can change suddenly and negatively. \n \nOur financial performance is highly dependent on the environment in which our businesses operate. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, high global gross domestic product growth, regulatory and market conditions that result in transparent, liquid and efficient capital markets, low inflation, business, consumer and investor confidence, stable geopolitical conditions and strong business earnings. \n \nUnfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by: low levels of or declines in economic growth, business activity or investor, business or consumer confidence; changes in consumer spending or borrowing patterns; pandemics; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; illiquid markets; increases in inflation, interest rates, exchange rate or basic commodity price volatility or default rates; concerns about sovereign defaults; uncertainty concerning fiscal or monetary policy, government shutdowns, debt ceilings or funding; the extent of and uncertainty about potential increases in tax rates and other regulatory changes; limitations on international trade and travel; laws and regulations that limit trading in, or the issuance of, securities of issuers outside their domestic markets; outbreaks of domestic or international tensions or hostilities, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, cyber security threats or attacks and other forms of disruption to or curtailment of global communication, energy transmission or transportation networks or other geopolitical instability or uncertainty; corporate, political or other scandals that reduce investor confidence in capital markets; extreme weather events or other natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nThe financial services industry and the securities and other financial markets have been materially and adversely affected in the past by significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes, by a serious lack of liquidity and by high levels of borrower defaults. In addition, concerns about the \nCOVID-19\n pandemic, European sovereign debt risk and its impact on the European banking system, limitations on international trade, and potential or actual changes in interest rates, inflation and other market conditions, have, at times, negatively impacted the levels of client activity. \n \nGeneral uncertainty about economic, political and market activities, and the scope, timing and impact of regulatory reform, as well as weak consumer, investor and CEO confidence resulting in large part from such uncertainty, has in the past negatively impacted client activity, which can adversely affect many of our businesses. Periods of low volatility and periods of high volatility combined with a lack of liquidity, have at times had an unfavorable impact on our market-making businesses. \n \nFinancial institution returns may be negatively impacted by increased funding costs due in part to the lack of perceived government support of such institutions in the event of future financial crises relative to financial institutions in countries in which governmental support is maintained. In addition, liquidity in the financial markets has also been negatively impacted as market participants and market practices and structures continue to adjust to evolving regulatory frameworks. \n \n \n \nOur businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by declining asset values, particularly where we have net \u201clong\u201d positions, receive fees based on the value of assets managed, or receive or post collateral. \n \nMany of our businesses have net \u201clong\u201d positions in debt securities, loans, derivatives, mortgages, equities (including private equity and real estate) and most other asset classes. These include positions we take when we act as a principal to facilitate our clients\u2019 activities, including our exchange-based market-making activities, or commit large amounts of capital to maintain positions in interest rate and credit products, as well as through our currencies, commodities, equities and mortgage-related activities. In addition, we invest in similar asset classes. Substantially all of our investing and market-making positions and a portion of our loans are \nmarked-to-market\n on a daily or other periodic basis and declines in asset values directly and promptly impact our earnings, unless we have effectively \u201chedged\u201d our exposures to those declines. \n \nIn certain circumstances (particularly in the case of credit products, including leveraged loans, and private equities or other securities that are not freely tradable or lack established and liquid trading markets), it may not be possible or economic to hedge our exposures and to the extent that we do so the hedge may be ineffective or may greatly reduce our ability to profit from increases in the values of the assets. Sudden declines and significant volatility in the prices of assets have in the past and may in the future substantially curtail or eliminate the trading markets for certain assets, which may make it difficult to sell, hedge or value such assets. The inability to sell or effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions and the difficulty in valuing assets may negatively affect our capital, liquidity or leverage ratios, increase our funding costs and generally require us to maintain additional capital. \n \nIn our exchange-based market-making activities, we are obligated by stock exchange rules to maintain an orderly market, including by purchasing securities in a declining market. In markets where asset values are declining and in volatile markets, this results in losses and an increased need for liquidity. \n \nWe receive asset-based management fees based on the value of our clients\u2019 portfolios or investment in funds managed by us and, in some cases, we also receive incentive fees based on increases in the value of such investments. Declines in asset values would ordinarily reduce the value of our clients\u2019 portfolios or fund assets, which in turn would typically reduce the fees we earn for managing such assets. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n31\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nWe post collateral to support our obligations and receive collateral that supports the obligations of our clients and counterparties. When the value of the assets posted as collateral or the credit ratings of the party posting collateral decline, the party posting the collateral may need to provide additional collateral or, if possible, reduce its trading position. An example of such a situation is a \u201cmargin call\u201d in connection with a brokerage account. Therefore, declines in the value of asset classes used as collateral mean that either the cost of funding positions is increased or the size of positions is decreased. If we are the party providing collateral, this can increase our costs and reduce our profitability and if we are the party receiving collateral, this can also reduce our profitability by reducing the level of business done with our clients and counterparties. \n \nIn addition, volatile or less liquid markets increase the difficulty of valuing assets, which can lead to costly and time-consuming disputes over asset values and the level of required collateral, as well as increased credit risk to the recipient of the collateral due to delays in receiving adequate collateral. In cases where we foreclose on collateral, sudden declines in the value or liquidity of the collateral has in the past and may in the future, despite credit monitoring, over-collateralization, the ability to call for additional collateral or the ability to force repayment of the underlying obligation, result in significant losses to us, especially where there is a single type of collateral supporting the obligation. In addition, we have been and may in the future be subject to claims that the foreclosure was not permitted under the legal documents, was conducted in an improper manner or caused a client or counterparty to go out of business. \n \nOur market-making activities have been and may in the future be affected by changes in the levels of market volatility. \n \nCertain of our market-making activities depend on market volatility to provide trading and arbitrage opportunities to our clients, and decreases in volatility have reduced and may in the future reduce these opportunities and the level of client activity associated with them and adversely affect the results of these activities. Increased volatility, while it can increase trading volumes and spreads, also increases risk as measured by \nValue-at-Risk\n (VaR) and may expose us to increased risks in connection with our market-making activities or cause us to reduce our inventory in order to avoid increasing our VaR. Limiting the size of our market-making positions can adversely affect our profitability. In periods when volatility is increasing, but asset values are declining significantly, it may not be possible to sell assets at all or it may only be possible to do so at steep discounts. In those circumstances we may be forced to either take on additional risk or to realize losses in order to decrease our VaR. In addition, increases in volatility increase the level of our RWAs, which increases our capital requirements. \n \n \n \nOur investment banking, client intermediation, asset management and wealth management businesses have been adversely affected and may in the future be adversely affected by market uncertainty or lack of confidence among investors and CEOs due to declines in economic activity and other unfavorable economic, geopolitical or market conditions. \n \nOur investment banking business has been and may in the future be adversely affected by market conditions. Poor economic conditions and other uncertain geopolitical conditions may adversely affect and have in the past adversely affected investor and CEO confidence, resulting in significant industry-wide declines in the size and number of underwritings and of financial advisory transactions, which would likely have an adverse effect on our revenues and our profit margins. In particular, because a significant portion of our investment banking revenues is derived from our participation in large transactions, a decline in the number of large transactions has in the past and would in the future adversely affect our investment banking business. Similarly, in recent years, cross-border initial public offerings and other securities offerings have accounted for a significant proportion of new issuance activity. Legislative, regulatory or other changes that limit trading in, or the issuance of, securities outside the issuers\u2019 domestic markets have in the past and would in the future adversely affect our underwriting business. \n \nIn certain circumstances, market uncertainty or general declines in market or economic activity may adversely affect our client intermediation businesses by decreasing levels of overall activity or by decreasing volatility, but at other times market uncertainty and even declining economic activity may result in higher trading volumes or higher spreads or both. \n \nMarket uncertainty, volatility and adverse economic conditions, as well as declines in asset values, may cause our clients to transfer their assets out of our funds\n \nor other products or their brokerage accounts and result in reduced net revenues, principally in our asset management and wealth management businesses. Even if clients do not withdraw their funds, they may invest them in products that generate less fee income. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n32\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nOur asset management and wealth management businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by the poor investment performance of our investment products or a client preference for products other than those which we offer or for products that generate lower fees. \n \nPoor investment returns in our asset management and wealth management businesses, due to either general market conditions or underperformance (relative to our competitors or to benchmarks) by funds or accounts that we manage or investment products that we design or sell, affects our ability to retain existing assets and to attract new clients or additional assets from existing clients. This could affect the management and incentive fees that we earn on AUS or the commissions and net spreads that we earn for selling other investment products, such as structured notes or derivatives. To the extent that our clients choose to invest in products that we do not currently offer, we will suffer outflows and a loss of management fees. Further, if, due to changes in investor sentiment or the relative performance of certain asset classes or otherwise, clients continue to invest in products that generate lower fees (e.g., passively managed or fixed income products), our average effective management fee would continue to decline and our asset management and wealth management businesses could be adversely affected. \n \nLiquidity \n \nOur liquidity, profitability and businesses may be adversely affected by an inability to access the debt capital markets or to sell assets. \n \nLiquidity is essential to our businesses. It is of critical importance to us, as most of the failures of financial institutions have occurred in large part due to insufficient liquidity. Our liquidity may be impaired by an inability to access secured and/or unsecured debt markets, an inability to raise or retain deposits, an inability to access funds from our subsidiaries or otherwise allocate liquidity optimally, an inability to sell assets or redeem our investments, lack of timely settlement of transactions, unusual deposit outflows, or other unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral, such as in March\u00a02020, when corporate clients drew on revolving credit facilities in response to the \nCOVID-19\n pandemic. This situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as a general market or economic disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties or us, or even by the perception among market participants that we, or other market participants, are experiencing greater liquidity risk. \n \n \n \nWe employ structured products to benefit our clients and hedge our own risks. The financial instruments that we hold and the contracts to which we are a party are often complex, and these complex structured products often do not have readily available markets to access in times of liquidity stress. Our investing and financing activities may lead to situations where the holdings from these activities represent a significant portion of specific markets, which could restrict liquidity for our positions. \n \nFurther, our ability to sell assets may be impaired if there is not generally a liquid market for such assets, as well as in circumstances where other market participants are seeking to sell similar otherwise generally liquid assets at the same time, as is likely to occur in a liquidity or other market crisis or in response to changes to rules or regulations. For example, recently an investment management firm with large positions with several financial institutions defaulted, resulting in rapidly declining prices in the securities underlying those positions. In addition, clearinghouses, exchanges and other financial institutions with which we interact may exercise \nset-off\n rights or the right to require additional collateral, including in difficult market conditions, which could further impair our liquidity. \n \nRegulatory changes relating to liquidity may also negatively impact our results of operations and competitive position. Numerous regulations have been adopted to introduce more stringent liquidity requirements for large financial institutions. These regulations address, among other matters, liquidity stress testing, minimum liquidity requirements, wholesale funding, limitations on the issuance of short-term debt and structured notes, deductions for holdings of TLAC and prohibitions on parent guarantees that are subject to certain cross-defaults. New and prospective liquidity-related regulations may overlap with, and be impacted by, other regulatory changes, including rules relating to minimum long-term debt requirements and TLAC, guidance on the treatment of brokered deposits and the capital, leverage and resolution and recovery frameworks applicable to large financial institutions. Given the overlap and complex interactions among these new and prospective regulations, they may have unintended cumulative effects, and their full impact will remain uncertain, while regulatory reforms are being adopted and market practices develop. In addition, our need to manage our operations in light of certain regulatory requirements when applicable thresholds are met has in the past limited and may in the future limit our ability to raise deposits in GSIB or other funding, which could adversely affect our liquidity or ability to respond efficiently to liquidity stress. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n33\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nOur businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by disruptions or lack of liquidity in the credit markets, including reduced access to credit and higher costs of obtaining credit. \n \nWidening credit spreads, as well as significant declines in the availability of credit, have in the past adversely affected our ability to borrow on a secured and unsecured basis and may do so in the future. We fund ourselves on an unsecured basis by issuing long-term debt and commercial paper, by raising deposits at our bank subsidiaries, by issuing hybrid financial instruments and by obtaining loans or lines of credit from commercial or other banking entities. We seek to finance many of our assets on a secured basis. Any disruptions in the credit markets may make it harder and more expensive to obtain funding for our businesses. If our available funding is limited or we are forced to fund our operations at a higher cost, these conditions may require us to curtail our business activities and increase our cost of funding, both of which could reduce our profitability, particularly in our businesses that involve investing, lending and market making. \n \nOur clients engaging in mergers, acquisitions and other types of strategic transactions often rely on access to the secured and unsecured credit markets to finance their transactions. A lack of available credit or an increased cost of credit can adversely affect the size, volume and timing of our clients\u2019 merger and acquisition transactions, particularly large transactions, and adversely affect our financial advisory and underwriting businesses. \n \nOur credit businesses have been and may in the future be negatively affected by a lack of liquidity in credit markets. A lack of liquidity reduces price transparency, increases price volatility and decreases transaction volumes and size, all of which can increase transaction risk or decrease the profitability of these businesses. \n \n \n \nReductions in our credit ratings or an increase in our credit spreads may adversely affect our liquidity and cost of funding. \n \nOur credit ratings are important to our liquidity. A reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position, increase our borrowing costs, limit our access to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under certain provisions in some of our trading and collateralized financing contracts. Under these provisions, counterparties could be permitted to terminate contracts with us or require us to post additional collateral. Termination of our trading and collateralized financing contracts could cause us to sustain losses and impair our liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or to make significant cash payments or securities movements. \n \nAs of December\u00a02021, our counterparties could have called for additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements in an aggregate amount of $345\u00a0million in the event of a \none-notch\n downgrade of our credit ratings and $1.54\u00a0billion in the event of a \ntwo-notch\n downgrade of our credit ratings. A downgrade by any one rating agency, depending on the agency\u2019s relative ratings of us at the time of the downgrade, may have an impact which is comparable to the impact of a downgrade by all rating agencies. For further information about our credit ratings, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u00a0\u2014 Risk Management\u00a0\u2014 Liquidity Risk Management\u00a0\u2014 Credit Ratings\u201d in Part\u00a0II, Item 7 of this \nForm\u00a010-K.\n \n \nOur cost of obtaining long-term unsecured funding is directly related to our credit spreads (the amount in excess of the interest rate of benchmark securities that we need to pay). Increases in our credit spreads can significantly increase our cost of this funding. Changes in credit spreads are continuous, market-driven, and subject at times to unpredictable and highly volatile movements. Our credit spreads are also influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness and movements in the costs to purchasers of credit default swaps referenced to our long-term debt. The market for credit default swaps has proven to be extremely volatile and at times has lacked a high degree of transparency or liquidity. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n34\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nGroup Inc. is a holding company and its liquidity depends on payments and loans from its subsidiaries, many of which are subject to legal, regulatory and other restrictions on providing funds or assets to Group Inc. \n \nGroup Inc. is a holding company and, therefore, depends on dividends, distributions, loans and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund share repurchases and dividend payments and to fund payments on its obligations, including debt obligations. Many of our subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries, are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to Group Inc. \n \nIn addition, our broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and to minimum regulatory capital and other requirements, as well as restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in brokerage or bank accounts to fund their businesses. Additional restrictions on related-party transactions, increased capital and liquidity requirements and additional limitations on the use of funds on deposit in bank or brokerage accounts, as well as lower earnings, can reduce the amount of funds available to meet the obligations of Group Inc., including under the FRB\u2019s source of strength requirement, and even require Group Inc. to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries. Restrictions or regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that Group Inc. needs to make payments on its obligations, including debt obligations, or dividend payments. In addition, Group Inc.\u2019s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors. \n \nThere has been a trend towards increased regulation and supervision of our subsidiaries by the governments and regulators in the countries in which those subsidiaries are located or do business. Concerns about protecting clients and creditors of financial institutions that are controlled by persons or entities located outside of the country in which such entities are located or do business have caused or may cause a number of governments and regulators to take additional steps to \u201cring fence\u201d or require internal total loss-absorbing capacity (which may also be subject to \n\u201cbail-in\u201d\n powers, as described below) at those entities in order to protect clients and creditors of those entities in the event of financial difficulties involving those entities. The result has been and may continue to be additional limitations on our ability to efficiently move capital and liquidity among our affiliated entities, or to Group Inc., including in times of liquidity stress, thereby increasing the overall level of capital and liquidity required by us on a consolidated basis. \n \n \n \nFurthermore, Group Inc. has guaranteed the payment obligations of certain of its subsidiaries, including GS&Co. and GS Bank USA, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, Group Inc. guarantees many of the obligations of its other consolidated subsidiaries on a \ntransaction-by-transaction\n basis, as negotiated with counterparties. These guarantees may require Group Inc. to provide substantial funds or assets to its subsidiaries or their creditors or counterparties at a time when Group Inc. is in need of liquidity to fund its own obligations. \n \nThe requirements for us and certain of our subsidiaries to develop and submit recovery and resolution plans to regulators, and the incorporation of feedback received from regulators, may require us to increase capital or liquidity levels or issue additional long-term debt at Group Inc. or particular subsidiaries or otherwise incur additional or duplicative operational or other costs at multiple entities, and may reduce our ability to provide Group Inc. guarantees of the obligations of our subsidiaries or raise debt at Group Inc. Resolution planning may also impair our ability to structure our intercompany and external activities in a manner that we may otherwise deem most operationally efficient. Furthermore, arrangements to facilitate our resolution planning may cause us to be subject to additional taxes. Any such limitations or requirements would be in addition to the legal and regulatory restrictions described above on our ability to engage in capital actions or make intercompany dividends or payments. \n \nSee \u201cBusiness\u00a0\u2014 Regulation\u201d in Part\u00a0I, Item\u00a01 of this \nForm\u00a010-K\n for further information about regulatory restrictions. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n35\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. A failure of a significant market participant, or even concerns about a default by such an institution, could lead to significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions, which in turn could adversely affect us. \n \nWe are also subject to the risk that our rights against third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances. In addition, deterioration in the credit quality of third parties whose securities or obligations we hold, including a deterioration in the value of collateral posted by third parties to secure their obligations to us under derivative contracts and loan agreements, could result in losses and/or adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or otherwise use those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes. \n \nA significant downgrade in the credit ratings of our counterparties could also have a negative impact on our results. While in many cases we are permitted to require additional collateral from counterparties that experience financial difficulty, disputes may arise as to the amount of collateral we are entitled to receive and the value of pledged assets. The termination of contracts and the foreclosure on collateral may subject us to claims for the improper exercise of our rights. Default rates, downgrades and disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral typically increase significantly in times of market stress, increased volatility and illiquidity. \n \nAs part of our clearing and prime brokerage activities, we finance our clients\u2019 positions, and we could be held responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our clients. Although we have limits and regularly review credit exposures to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries, countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee. \n \n \n \nConcentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our market-making, underwriting, investing and financing activities. \n \nConcentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our market-making, underwriting, investing and financing activities. The number and size of these transactions has affected and may in the future affect our results of operations in a given period. Moreover, because of concentrated risk, we may suffer losses even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable for our competitors. Disruptions in the credit markets can make it difficult to hedge these credit exposures effectively or economically. In addition, we extend large commitments as part of our credit origination activities. \n \nRules adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act, and similar rules adopted in other jurisdictions, require issuers of certain asset-backed securities and any person who organizes and initiates certain asset-backed securities transactions to retain economic exposure to the asset, which has affected the cost of and structures used in connection with these securitization activities. Our inability to reduce our credit risk by selling, syndicating or securitizing these positions, including during periods of market stress, could negatively affect our results of operations due to a decrease in the fair value of the positions, including due to the insolvency or bankruptcy of borrowers, as well as the loss of revenues associated with selling such securities or loans. \n \nIn the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular counterparty, borrower, issuer (including sovereign issuers) or geographic area or group of related countries, such as the E.U., and a failure or downgrade of, or default by, such entity could negatively impact our businesses, perhaps materially, and the systems by which we set limits and monitor the level of our credit exposure to individual entities, industries, countries and regions may not function as we have anticipated. Regulatory reform, including the Dodd-Frank Act, has led to increased centralization of trading activity through particular clearing houses, central agents or exchanges, which has significantly increased our concentration of risk with respect to these entities. While our activities expose us to many different industries, counterparties and countries, we routinely execute a high volume of transactions with counterparties engaged in financial services activities, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, clearing houses, exchanges and investment funds. This has resulted in significant credit concentration with respect to these counterparties. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n36\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nDerivative transactions and delayed documentation or settlements may expose us to credit risk, unexpected risks and potential losses. \n \nWe are party to a large number of derivative transactions, including credit derivatives. Many of these derivative instruments are individually negotiated and \nnon-standardized,\n which can make exiting, transferring or settling positions difficult. Many credit derivatives require that we deliver to the counterparty the underlying security, loan or other obligation in order to receive payment. In a number of cases, we do not hold the underlying security, loan or other obligation and may not be able to obtain the underlying security, loan or other obligation. This could cause us to forfeit the payments due to us under these contracts or result in settlement delays with the attendant credit and operational risk, as well as increased costs to us. \n \nDerivative transactions may also involve the risk that documentation has not been properly executed, that executed agreements may not be enforceable against the counterparty, or that obligations under such agreements may not be able to be \u201cnetted\u201d against other obligations with such counterparty. In addition, counterparties may claim that such transactions were not appropriate or authorized. \n \nAs a signatory to the ISDA Universal Protocol or U.S. ISDA Protocol (ISDA Protocols) and being subject to the FRB\u2019s and FDIC\u2019s rules on QFCs and similar rules in other jurisdictions, we may not be able to exercise remedies against counterparties and, as this new regime has not yet been tested, we may suffer risks or losses that we would not have expected to suffer if we could immediately close out transactions upon a termination event. The ISDA Protocols and these rules and regulations extend to repurchase agreements and other instruments that are not derivative contracts. \n \nDerivative contracts and other transactions, including secondary bank loan purchases and sales, entered into with third parties are not always confirmed by the counterparties or settled on a timely basis. While the transaction remains unconfirmed or during any delay in settlement, we are subject to heightened credit and operational risk and in the event of a default may find it more difficult to enforce our rights. \n \n \n \nIn addition, as new complex derivative products are created, covering a wider array of underlying credit and other instruments, disputes about the terms of the underlying contracts could arise, which could impair our ability to effectively manage our risk exposures from these products and subject us to increased costs. The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act requiring central clearing of credit derivatives and other OTC derivatives, or a market shift toward standardized derivatives, could reduce the risk associated with these transactions, but under certain circumstances could also limit our ability to develop derivatives that best suit the needs of our clients and to hedge our own risks, and could adversely affect our profitability and has increased our credit exposure to central clearing platforms. \n \nOperational \n \nA failure in our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, as well as human error, malfeasance or other misconduct, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses. \n \nOur businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex and occur at high volumes and frequencies, across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies. These transactions, as well as the information technology services we provide to clients, often must adhere to client-specific guidelines, as well as legal and regulatory standards. \n \nMany rules and regulations worldwide govern our obligations to execute transactions and report such transactions and other information to regulators, exchanges and investors. Compliance with these legal and reporting requirements can be challenging, and we have been and may in the future be subject to regulatory fines and penalties for failing to follow these rules or to report timely, accurate and complete information in accordance with these rules. As such requirements expand, compliance with these rules and regulations has become more challenging. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n37\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nAs our client base, including through our consumer businesses, and our geographical reach expand and the volume, speed, frequency and complexity of transactions, especially electronic transactions (as well as the requirements to report such transactions on a real-time basis to clients, regulators and exchanges) increase, developing and maintaining our operational systems and infrastructure becomes more challenging, and the risk of systems or human error in connection with such transactions increases, as well as the potential consequences of such errors due to the speed and volume of transactions involved and the potential difficulty associated with discovering errors quickly enough to limit the resulting consequences. Such risks are exacerbated in times of increased volatility. As with other similarly situated institutions, we utilize credit underwriting models in connection with our businesses, including our consumer-oriented activities. Allegations, whether or not accurate, that the ultimate underwriting decisions do not treat consumers or clients fairly, or comply with the applicable law or regulation, can result in negative publicity, reputational damage and governmental and regulatory scrutiny, investigations and enforcement actions. \n \nOur financial, accounting, data processing or other operational systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as a spike in transaction volume, adversely affecting our ability to process these transactions or provide these services. We must continuously update these systems to support our operations and growth and to respond to changes in regulations and markets, and invest heavily in systemic controls and training to pursue our objective of ensuring that such transactions do not violate applicable rules and regulations or, due to errors in processing such transactions, adversely affect markets, our clients and counterparties or us. Enhancements and updates to systems, as well as the requisite training, including in connection with the integration of new businesses, entail significant costs and create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones. \n \n \n \nThe use of computing devices and phones is critical to the work done by our employees and the operation of our systems and businesses and those of our clients and our third-party service providers and vendors. Their importance has continued to increase, in particular in light of work-from-home arrangements implemented in response to the \nCOVID-19\n pandemic. Computers and computer networks are subject to various risks, including, among others, cyber attacks, inherent technological defects, system failures and human error. For example, fundamental security flaws in computer chips found in many types of these computing devices and phones have been reported in the past and may be discovered in the future. Cloud technologies are also critical to the operation of our systems and platforms and our reliance on cloud technologies is growing. Service disruptions have resulted, and may result in the future, in delays in accessing, or the loss of, data that is important to our businesses and may hinder our clients\u2019 access to our platforms. During 2021, there were a number of widely publicized cases of outages in connection with access to cloud computing providers. Addressing these and similar issues could be costly and affect the performance of these businesses and systems. Operational risks may be incurred in applying fixes and there may still be residual security risks. \n \nAdditionally, although the prevalence and scope of applications of distributed ledger technology and similar technologies is growing, the technology is also nascent and may be vulnerable to cyber attacks or have other inherent weaknesses. We are exposed to risks, and may become exposed to additional risks, related to distributed ledger technology, including through our facilitation of clients\u2019 activities involving financial products that use distributed ledger technology, such as blockchain or cryptocurrencies, our investments in companies that seek to develop platforms based on distributed ledger technology, the use of distributed ledger technology by third-party vendors, clients, counterparties, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries, and the receipt of cryptocurrencies or other digital assets as collateral. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n38\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nNotwithstanding the proliferation of technology and technology-based risk and control systems, our businesses ultimately rely on people as our greatest resource, and, from time to time, they have in the past and may in the future make mistakes or engage in violations of applicable policies, laws, rules or procedures that are not always caught immediately by our technological processes or by our controls and other procedures, which are intended to prevent and detect such errors or violations. These have in the past and may in the future include calculation errors, mistakes in addressing emails, errors in software or model development or implementation, or simple errors in judgment, as well as intentional efforts to ignore or circumvent applicable policies, laws, rules or procedures. Human errors, malfeasance and other misconduct, including the intentional misuse of client information in connection with insider trading or for other purposes, even if promptly discovered and remediated, has in the past and may in the future result in reputational damage and losses and liabilities for us. \n \nIn addition, we face the risk of operational failure or significant operational delay, termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities and derivatives transactions, and as our interconnectivity with our clients grows, we increasingly face the risk of operational failure or significant operational delay with respect to our clients\u2019 systems. \n \nThere has been significant consolidation among clearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses and an increasing number of derivative transactions are cleared on exchanges, which has increased our exposure to operational failure or significant operational delay, termination or capacity constraints of the particular financial intermediaries that we use and could affect our ability to find adequate and cost-effective alternatives in the event of any such failure, delay, termination or constraint. Industry consolidation, whether among market participants or financial intermediaries, increases the risk of operational failure or significant operational delay as disparate complex systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis. \n \n \n \nThe interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents, exchanges and clearing houses, and the increased centrality of these entities, increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industry-wide operational failure that could materially impact our ability to conduct business. Interconnectivity of financial institutions with other companies through, among other things, application programming interfaces or APIs presents similar risks. Any such failure, termination or constraint could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk or expand our businesses or result in financial loss or liability to our clients, impairment of our liquidity, disruption of our businesses, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. \n \nDespite our resiliency plans and facilities, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities where we are located. This may include a disruption involving electrical, satellite, undersea cable or other communications, internet, transportation or other facilities used by us, our employees or third parties with which we conduct business, including cloud service providers. These disruptions may occur as a result of events that affect only our buildings or systems or those of such third parties, or as a result of events with a broader impact globally, regionally or in the cities where those buildings or systems are located, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, war, civil unrest, terrorism, economic or political developments, pandemics and weather events. \n \nIn addition, although we seek to diversify our third-party vendors to increase our resiliency, we are also exposed to the risk that a disruption or other information technology event at a common service provider to our vendors could impede their ability to provide products or services to us, including in connection with our new business initiatives. We may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate operational risks relating to our vendors\u2019 use of common service providers. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n39\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nAside from work-from-home arrangements during the \nCOVID-19\n pandemic, nearly all of our employees in our primary locations, including the New York metropolitan area, London, Bengaluru, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Salt Lake City, work in close proximity to one another, in one or more buildings. Notwithstanding our efforts to maintain business continuity, given that our headquarters and the largest concentration of our employees are in the New York metropolitan area, and our two principal office buildings in the New York area both are located on the waterfront of the Hudson River, depending on the intensity and longevity of the event, a catastrophic event impacting our New York metropolitan area offices, including a terrorist attack, extreme weather event or other hostile or catastrophic event, could negatively affect our business. If a disruption occurs in one location and our employees in that location are unable to occupy our offices or communicate with or travel to other locations or successfully work remotely, our ability to service and interact with our clients may suffer, and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication, work-from-home arrangements or travel. \n \nA failure to protect our computer systems, networks and information, and our clients\u2019 information, against cyber attacks and similar threats could impair our ability to conduct our businesses, result in the disclosure, theft or destruction of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses. \n \nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and those of our vendors. There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving financial services companies, consumer-based companies, software and information technology service providers, governmental agencies and other organizations reporting the unauthorized access or disclosure of client, customer or other confidential information in recent years, as well as cyber attacks involving the dissemination, theft and destruction of corporate information or other assets, as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by foreign governments. There have also been several highly publicized cases where hackers have requested \u201cransom\u201d payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to information or systems. \n \n \n \nWe are regularly the target of attempted cyber attacks, including \ndenial-of-service\n attacks, and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect the integrity and functionality of our technology infrastructure and access to and the security of our data. We have faced an increasing number of attempted cyber attacks as we expand our mobile- and other internet-based products and services, as well as our usage of mobile and cloud technologies, and as we provide more of these services to a greater number of individual consumers. The increasing migration of our communication from devices we provide to employee-owned devices presents additional risks of cyber attacks, as do work-from-home arrangements such as those implemented in response to the \nCOVID-19\n pandemic. In addition, due to our interconnectivity with third-party vendors (and their respective service providers), central agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial institutions, we could be adversely impacted if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other information security event. These impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the third party subject to the cyber attack or other information security event, which could, in turn, interrupt certain of our businesses. \n \nDespite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and information, we may not be able to anticipate, detect or implement effective preventive measures against all cyber threats, especially because the techniques used are increasingly sophisticated, change frequently and are often not recognized until launched. Cyber attacks can originate from a variety of sources, including third parties who are affiliated with or sponsored by foreign governments or are involved with organized crime or terrorist organizations. Third parties may also attempt to place individuals in our offices or induce employees, clients or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information or provide access to our data or that of our clients, and these types of risks may be difficult to detect or prevent. \n \nAlthough we take protective measures proactively and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber attacks on our vendors and other events that could have a security impact. Risks relating to cyber attacks on our vendors have been increasing given the greater frequency and severity in recent years of supply chain attacks affecting software and information technology service providers. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our systems, the process of enhancing our protective measures can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues. In addition, protective measures that we employ to compartmentalize our data may reduce our visibility into, and adversely affect our ability to respond to, cyber threats and issues with our systems. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n40\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nIf one or more of such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize our or our clients\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 confidential and other information processed, stored in, or transmitted through our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or those of our clients, counterparties or third parties, which could impact their ability to transact with us or otherwise result in legal or regulatory action, significant losses or reputational damage. In addition, such an event could persist for an extended period of time before being detected, and, following detection, it could take considerable time for us to obtain full and reliable information about the extent, amount and type of information compromised. During the course of an investigation, we may not know the full impact of the event and how to remediate it, and actions, decisions and mistakes that are taken or made may further increase the negative effects of the event on our business, results of operations and reputation. \n \nWe have expended, and expect to continue to expend, significant resources on an ongoing basis to modify our protective measures and to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, but these measures may be ineffective and we may be subject to legal or regulatory action, as well as financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us. \n \nOur clients\u2019 confidential information may also be at risk from the compromise of clients\u2019 personal electronic devices or as a result of a data security breach at an unrelated company. Losses due to unauthorized account activity could harm our reputation and may have adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n \nThe increased use of mobile and cloud technologies can heighten these and other operational risks, as can work-from-home arrangements. Certain aspects of the security of such technologies are unpredictable or beyond our control, and the failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber attacks could disrupt our operations and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential and other information. In addition, there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures, despite their sophistication, may be defeated, particularly to the extent that new computing technologies vastly increase the speed and computing power available. \n \n \n \nWe routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means. We have discussed and worked with clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against cyber attacks, but we do not have, and may be unable to put in place, secure capabilities with all of our clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties and we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information. An interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a client, vendor, service provider, counterparty or other third party could result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm. \n \nWe may incur losses as a result of ineffective risk management processes and strategies. \n \nWe seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a risk and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance and legal reporting systems, internal controls, management review processes and other mechanisms. Our risk management process seeks to balance our ability to profit from market-making, investing or lending positions, and underwriting activities, with our exposure to potential losses. While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the specifics and timing of such outcomes. Thus, in the course of our activities, we have incurred and may in the future incur losses. Market conditions in recent years have involved unprecedented dislocations and highlight the limitations inherent in using historical data to manage risk. \n \nThe models that we use to assess and control our risk exposures reflect assumptions about the degrees of correlation or lack thereof among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or conversely previously correlated indicators may move in different directions. These types of market movements have at times limited the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and have caused us to incur significant losses, and they may do so in the future. These changes in correlation have been and may in the future be exacerbated where other market participants are using risk or trading models with assumptions or algorithms that are similar to ours. In these and other cases, it may be difficult to reduce our risk positions due to the activity of other market participants or widespread market dislocations, including circumstances where asset values are declining significantly or no market exists for certain assets. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n41\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law and regulation, we invest our own capital in private equity, credit, real estate and hedge funds that we manage and limitations on our ability to withdraw some or all of our investments in these funds, whether for legal, reputational or other reasons, may make it more difficult for us to control the risk exposures relating to these investments. \n \nPrudent risk management, as well as regulatory restrictions, may cause us to limit our exposure to counterparties, geographic areas or markets, which may limit our business opportunities and increase the cost of our funding or hedging activities. \n \nAs we have expanded and intend to continue to expand the product and geographic scope of our offerings of credit products to consumers, we are presented with different credit risks and must expand and adapt our credit risk monitoring and mitigation activities to account for these business activities. A failure to adequately assess and control such risk exposures could result in losses to us. \n \nFor further information about our risk management policies and procedures, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u00a0\u2014 Risk Management\u201d in Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a07 of this \nForm\u00a010-K.\n \n \nWe may incur losses as a result of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including pandemics, terrorist attacks, extreme weather events or other natural disasters. \n \nThe occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including pandemics, such as \nCOVID-19,\n or other widespread health emergencies (or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency), terrorist attacks, extreme weather events, solar events or other natural disasters, could create economic and financial disruptions, and could lead to operational difficulties (including travel limitations and limitations on occupancy in our offices) that could impair our ability to manage our businesses.\n \n \n \n \n \nClimate change could disrupt our businesses and adversely affect client activity levels and the creditworthiness of our clients and counterparties, and our efforts to address concerns relating to climate change could result in damage to our reputation. \n \nClimate change may cause extreme weather events that disrupt operations at one or more of our primary locations, which may negatively affect our ability to service and interact with our clients, adversely affect the value of our investments, including our real estate investments, and reduce the availability or increase the cost of insurance. Climate change and the transition to a less carbon-dependent economy may also have a negative impact on the operations or financial condition of our clients and counterparties, which may decrease revenues from those clients and counterparties and increase the credit risk associated with loans and other credit exposures to those clients and counterparties. In addition, climate change may impact the broader economy. \n \nWe are also exposed to risks resulting from changes in public policy, laws and regulations, or market and public perceptions and preferences in connection with the transition to a less carbon-dependent economy. These changes could adversely affect our business, results of operations and reputation. For example, our reputation and client relationships may be damaged as a result of our involvement, or our clients\u2019 involvement, in certain industries or projects associated with causing or exacerbating climate change, as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change. If we are unable to achieve our objectives relating to climate change or our response to climate change is perceived to be ineffective or insufficient, our business, reputation and efforts to recruit and retain employees may suffer. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n42\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nNew regulations or guidance relating to climate change, as well as the perspectives of regulators, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders regarding climate change, may affect whether and on what terms and conditions we engage in certain activities or offer certain products. Federal and state, and \nnon-U.S.\n banking regulators and supervisory authorities, shareholders and other stakeholders have increasingly viewed financial institutions as playing an important role in helping to address risks related to climate change, both directly and with respect to their clients, which may result in financial institutions coming under increased requirements and expectations regarding the disclosure and management of their climate risks and related lending, investment and advisory activities. We also may become subject to new or heightened regulatory requirements relating to climate change, such as requirements relating to operational resiliency or stress testing for various climate stress scenarios. Any such new or heightened requirements could result in increased regulatory, compliance or other costs or higher capital requirements. The risks associated with, and the perspective of regulators, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders regarding, climate change are continuing to evolve rapidly, which can make it difficult to assess the ultimate impact on us of climate change-related risks and uncertainties, and we expect that climate change-related risks will increase over time. \n \nLegal and Regulatory \n \nOur businesses and those of our clients are subject to extensive and pervasive regulation around the world. \n \nAs a participant in the financial services industry and a systemically important financial institution, we are subject to extensive regulation in jurisdictions around the world. We face the risk of significant intervention by law enforcement, regulatory and taxing authorities, as well as private litigation, in all jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses. In many cases, our activities have been and may continue to be subject to overlapping and divergent regulation in different jurisdictions. Among other things, as a result of law enforcement authorities, regulators or private parties challenging our compliance with existing laws and regulations, we or our employees have been, and could be, fined, criminally charged or sanctioned; prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities; subjected to limitations or conditions on our business activities, including higher capital requirements; or subjected to new or substantially higher taxes or other governmental charges in connection with the conduct of our businesses or with respect to our employees. These limitations or conditions may limit our business activities and negatively impact our profitability. \n \n \n \nIn addition to the impact on the scope and profitability of our business activities, \nday-to-day\n compliance with existing laws and regulations has involved and will continue to involve significant amounts of time, including that of our senior leaders and that of a large number of dedicated compliance and other reporting and operational personnel, all of which may negatively impact our profitability. \n \nOur revenues and profitability and those of our competitors have been and will continue to be impacted by requirements relating to capital, additional loss-absorbing capacity, leverage, minimum liquidity and long-term funding levels, requirements related to resolution and recovery planning, derivatives clearing and margin rules and levels of regulatory oversight, as well as limitations on which and, if permitted, how certain business activities may be carried out by financial institutions. The laws and regulations that apply to our businesses are often complex and, in many cases, we must make interpretive decisions regarding the application of those laws and regulations to our business activities. Changes in interpretations, whether in response to regulatory guidance, industry conventions, our own reassessments or otherwise, could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations or ability to satisfy applicable regulatory requirements, such as capital or liquidity requirements. \n \nIf there are new laws or regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or those of our clients, including capital, liquidity, leverage, long-term debt, total loss-absorbing capacity and margin requirements, restrictions on leveraged lending or other business practices, reporting requirements, requirements relating to recovery and resolution planning, tax burdens and compensation restrictions, that are imposed on a limited subset of financial institutions (whether based on size, method of funding, activities, geography or other criteria), compliance with these new laws or regulations, or changes in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations, could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are not affected in the same way. In addition, regulation imposed on financial institutions or market participants generally, such as taxes on stock transfers and other financial transactions, could adversely impact levels of market activity more broadly, and thus impact our businesses. Changes to laws or regulations, such as tax laws, could also have a disproportionate impact on us, based on the way those laws or regulations are applied to financial services and financial firms or due to our corporate structure. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n43\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nThese developments could impact our profitability in the affected jurisdictions, or even make it uneconomic for us to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in those jurisdictions, or could cause us to incur significant costs associated with changing our business practices, restructuring our businesses, moving all or certain of our businesses and our employees to other locations or complying with applicable capital requirements, including reducing dividends or share repurchases, liquidating assets or raising capital in a manner that adversely increases our funding costs or otherwise adversely affects our shareholders and creditors. \n \nU.S. and \nnon-U.S.\n regulatory developments, in particular the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel\u00a0III, have significantly altered the regulatory framework within which we operate and have adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our profitability. Among the aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act that have affected or may in the future affect our businesses are: increased capital, liquidity and reporting requirements; limitations on activities in which we may engage; increased regulation of and restrictions on OTC derivatives markets and transactions; limitations on incentive compensation; limitations on affiliate transactions; requirements to reorganize or limit activities in connection with recovery and resolution planning; increased deposit insurance assessments; and increased standards of care for broker-dealers and investment advisers in dealing with clients. The implementation of higher capital requirements, more stringent requirements relating to liquidity, long-term debt and total loss-absorbing capacity and the prohibition on proprietary trading and the sponsorship of, or investment in, covered funds by the Volcker Rule may continue to adversely affect our profitability and competitive position, particularly if these requirements do not apply equally to our competitors or are not implemented uniformly across jurisdictions. We may also become subject to higher and more stringent capital and other regulatory requirements as a result of the implementation of Basel Committee standards, including the new credit and operational risk capital standards published in December\u00a02017 and the new market risk capital standard published in January\u00a02019. \n \n \n \nAs described in \u201cBusiness\u00a0\u2014 Regulation\u00a0\u2014 Banking Supervision and Regulation\u201d in Part\u00a0I, Item\u00a01 of this \nForm\u00a010-K,\n the SCB has replaced the capital conservation buffer under the Standardized Capital Rules and resulted in higher Standardized capital ratio requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could limit our ability to, among other things, repurchase shares, pay dividends and make certain discretionary compensation payments. In addition, if, as in 2020, we are required to resubmit our capital plan, we generally may not make capital distributions, such as share repurchases or dividends, without the prior approval of the FRB. Dividends and repurchases are also subject to oversight by the FRB, which can result in limitations. Limitations on our ability to make capital distributions could, among other things, prevent us from returning capital to our shareholders and impact our return on equity. Additionally, as a \nG-SIB,\n we are subject to the \nG-SIB\n surcharge. Our \nG-SIB\n surcharge is updated annually based on financial data from the prior year. Expansion of our businesses, growth in our balance sheet and increased reliance on short-term wholesale funding have resulted in increases and in the future may result in further increases in our \nG-SIB\n surcharge and a corresponding increase in our capital requirements. \n \nWe are also subject to laws and regulations, such as the GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act, relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees or others, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to liability and/or reputational damage. As new privacy-related laws and regulations are implemented, the time and resources needed for us to comply with such laws and regulations, as well as our potential liability for \nnon-compliance\n and reporting obligations in the case of data breaches, may significantly increase. \n \nIn addition, our businesses are increasingly subject to laws and regulations relating to surveillance, encryption and data \non-shoring\n in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to change our policies, procedures and technology for information security, which could, among other things, make us more vulnerable to cyber attacks and misappropriation, corruption or loss of information or technology. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n44\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nWe have entered into consumer-oriented deposit-taking, lending and credit card businesses, and we expect to expand the product and geographic scope of our offerings. Entering into these businesses subjects us to numerous additional regulations in the jurisdictions in which these businesses operate. Not only are these regulations extensive, but they involve types of regulations and supervision, as well as regulatory compliance risks, that have not historically applied to us. The level of regulatory scrutiny and the scope of regulations affecting financial interactions with consumers is often much greater than that associated with doing business with institutions and \nhigh-net-worth\n individuals. Complying with these regulations is time-consuming, costly and presents new and increased risks. \n \nIncreasingly, regulators and courts have sought to hold financial institutions liable for the misconduct of their clients where they have determined that the financial institution should have detected that the client was engaged in wrongdoing, even though the financial institution had no direct knowledge of the activities engaged in by its client. Regulators and courts have also increasingly found liability as a \u201ccontrol person\u201d for activities of entities in which financial institutions or funds controlled by financial institutions have an investment, but which they do not actively manage. In addition, regulators and courts continue to seek to establish \u201cfiduciary\u201d obligations to counterparties to which no such duty had been assumed to exist. To the extent that such efforts are successful, the cost of, and liabilities associated with, engaging in brokerage, clearing, market-making, prime brokerage, investing and other similar activities could increase significantly. To the extent that we have fiduciary obligations in connection with acting as a financial adviser or investment adviser or in other roles for individual, institutional, sovereign or investment fund clients, any breach, or even an alleged breach, of such obligations could have materially negative legal, regulatory and reputational consequences. \n \nFor information about the extensive regulation to which our businesses are subject, see \u201cBusiness\u00a0\u2014 Regulation\u201d in Part\u00a0I, Item\u00a01 of this \nForm\u00a010-K.\n \n \n \n \nA failure to appropriately identify and address potential conflicts of interest could adversely affect our businesses. \n \nDue to the broad scope of our businesses and our client base, we regularly address potential conflicts of interest, including situations where our services to a particular client or our own investments or other interests conflict, or are perceived to conflict, with the interests of that client or another client, as well as situations where one or more of our businesses have access to material \nnon-public\n information that may not be shared with our other businesses and situations where we may be a creditor of an entity with which we also have an advisory or other relationship. \n \nIn addition, our status as a BHC subjects us to heightened regulation and increased regulatory scrutiny by the FRB with respect to transactions between GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries and entities that are or could be viewed as affiliates of ours and, under the Volcker Rule, transactions between us and covered funds. \n \nWe have extensive procedures and controls that are designed to identify and address conflicts of interest, including those designed to prevent the improper sharing of information among our businesses. However, appropriately identifying and dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and our reputation, which is one of our most important assets, could be damaged and the willingness of clients to enter into transactions with us may be adversely affected if we fail, or appear to fail, to identify, disclose and deal appropriately with conflicts of interest. In addition, potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions. Additionally, our \nOne Goldman Sachs\n initiative aims to increase collaboration among our businesses, which may increase the potential for actual or perceived conflicts of interest and improper information sharing. \n \nWe may be adversely affected by increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny or negative publicity. \n \nGovernmental scrutiny from regulators, legislative bodies and law enforcement agencies with respect to matters relating to compensation, our business practices, our past actions and other matters remains at high levels. Political and public sentiment regarding financial institutions has in the past and may in the future result in a significant amount of adverse press coverage, as well as adverse statements or charges by regulators or other government officials. Press coverage and other public statements that assert some form of wrongdoing (including, in some cases, press coverage and public statements that do not directly involve us) often result in some type of investigation by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials or in lawsuits. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n45\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nResponding to these investigations and lawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceeding, is time-consuming and expensive and can divert the time and effort of our senior management from our business. Penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased substantially and certain regulators have been more likely in recent years to commence enforcement actions or to support legislation targeted at the financial services industry. Governmental authorities may also be more likely to pursue criminal or other actions, including seeking admissions of wrongdoing or guilty pleas, in connection with the resolution of an inquiry or investigation to the extent a company is viewed as having previously engaged in criminal, regulatory or other misconduct. Adverse publicity, governmental scrutiny and legal and enforcement proceedings can also have a negative impact on our reputation and on the morale and performance of our employees, which could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations. \n \nThe financial services industry generally and our businesses in particular have been subject to negative publicity. Our reputation and businesses may be adversely affected by negative publicity or information regarding our businesses and personnel, whether or not accurate or true, that may be posted on social media or other internet forums or published by news organizations. Postings on these types of forums may also adversely impact risk positions of our clients and other parties that owe us money, securities or other assets and increase the chance that they will not perform their obligations to us or reduce the revenues we receive from their use of our services. The speed and pervasiveness with which information can be disseminated through these channels, in particular social media, may magnify risks relating to negative publicity. \n \nSubstantial civil or criminal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause us significant reputational harm, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. \n \nWe face significant legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high. See Notes\u00a018 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements in Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a08 of this \nForm\u00a010-K\n for information about certain of our legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations. We have seen legal claims by consumers and clients increase in a market downturn and employment-related claims increase following periods in which we have reduced our headcount. Additionally, governmental entities have been plaintiffs and are parties in certain of our legal proceedings, and we may face future civil or criminal actions or claims by the same or other governmental entities, as well as \nfollow-on\n civil litigation that is often commenced after regulatory settlements. \n \n \n \nSignificant settlements by several large financial institutions, including, in some cases, us, with governmental entities have been publicly announced. The trend of large settlements with governmental entities may adversely affect the outcomes for other financial institutions in similar actions, especially where governmental officials have announced that the large settlements will be used as the basis or a template for other settlements. The uncertain regulatory enforcement environment makes it difficult to estimate probable losses, which can lead to substantial disparities between legal reserves and subsequent actual settlements or penalties. \n \nClaims of collusion or anti-competitive conduct have become more common. Civil cases have been brought against financial institutions (including us) alleging \nbid-rigging,\n group boycotts or other anti-competitive practices. Antitrust laws generally provide for joint and several liability and treble damages. These claims have resulted in significant settlements in the past and may do so in the future. \n \nWe are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, including the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act, relating to corrupt and illegal payments to, and hiring practices with regard to, government officials and others. Violation of these or similar laws and regulations have in the past resulted in and could in the future result in significant monetary penalties. Such violations could also result in severe restrictions on our activities and damage to our reputation. \n \nCertain law enforcement authorities have recently required admissions of wrongdoing, and, in some cases, criminal pleas, as part of the resolutions of matters brought against financial institutions or their employees. See for example, \u201c1MDB-Related Matters\u201d in Note\u00a027 to the consolidated financial statements in Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a08 of this \nForm\u00a010-K.\n Any such resolution of a criminal matter involving us or our employees could lead to increased exposure to civil litigation, could adversely affect our reputation, could result in penalties or limitations on our ability to conduct our activities generally or in certain circumstances and could have other negative effects. Further, as a result of the 1MDB settlement, we are no longer a \u201cwell-known seasoned issuer,\u201d which places limitations on the manner in which we can market our securities. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n46\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nIn conducting our businesses around the world, we are subject to political, legal, regulatory and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries. \n \nIn conducting our businesses and supporting our global operations, we are subject to risks of possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, communications and other content restrictions, and other restrictive governmental actions. For example, sanctions have been imposed by the U.S. and the E.U. on certain individuals and companies in Russia and Venezuela. In many countries, the laws and regulations applicable to the securities and financial services industries and many of the transactions in which we are involved are uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market. We have been in some cases subject to divergent and conflicting laws and regulations across markets, and we are increasingly subject to the risk that the jurisdictions in which we operate may implement laws and regulations that directly conflict with those of another jurisdiction. Any determination by local regulators that we have not acted in compliance with the application of local laws in a particular market or our failure to develop effective working relationships with local regulators could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market, but also on our reputation generally. Further, in some jurisdictions a failure, or alleged failure, to comply with laws and regulations has subjected and may in the future subject us and our personnel not only to civil actions, but also criminal actions and other sanctions. We are also subject to the enhanced risk that transactions we structure might not be legally enforceable in all cases. \n \nWhile business and other practices throughout the world differ, our principal entities are subject in their operations worldwide to rules and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments, hiring practices and money laundering, as well as laws relating to doing business with certain individuals, groups and countries, such as the FCPA, the BSA and the U.K. Bribery Act. While we have invested and continue to invest significant resources in training and in compliance monitoring, the geographical diversity of our operations, employees, clients and consumers, as well as the vendors and other third parties that we deal with, greatly increases the risk that we may be found in violation of such rules or regulations and any such violation could subject us to significant penalties or adversely affect our reputation. See for example, \u201c1MDB-Related Matters\u201d in Note\u00a027 to the consolidated financial statements in Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a08 of this \nForm\u00a010-K.\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, there have been a number of highly publicized cases around the world, involving actual or alleged fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry, and we have had and may in the future have employee misconduct. This misconduct has included and may also in the future include intentional efforts to ignore or circumvent applicable policies, rules or procedures or misappropriation of funds and the theft of proprietary information, including proprietary software. It is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity have not been and may not be effective in all cases, as reflected by the settlements relating to 1MDB. \n \nThe application of regulatory strategies and requirements in the U.S. and \nnon-U.S.\n jurisdictions to facilitate the orderly resolution of large financial institutions could create greater risk of loss for Group Inc.\u2019s security holders. \n \nAs described in \u201cBusiness\u00a0\u2014 Regulation\u00a0\u2014 Banking Supervision and Regulation\u00a0\u2014 Insolvency of an IDI or a BHC,\u201d if the FDIC is appointed as receiver under OLA, the rights of Group Inc.\u2019s creditors would be determined under OLA, and substantial differences exist in the rights of creditors between OLA and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC under OLA to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in some circumstances, which could have a material adverse effect on our debtholders. \n \nThe FDIC has announced that a single point of entry strategy may be a desirable strategy under OLA to resolve a large financial institution in a manner that would, among other things, impose losses on shareholders, debtholders and other creditors of the \ntop-tier\n BHC (in our case, Group Inc.), while the BHC\u2019s subsidiaries may continue to operate. It is possible that the application of the single point of entry strategy under OLA, in which Group Inc. would be the only entity to enter resolution proceedings (and its material broker-dealer, bank and other operating entities would not enter resolution proceedings), would result in greater losses to Group Inc.\u2019s security holders (including holders of our fixed rate, floating rate and indexed debt securities), than the losses that would result from the application of a bankruptcy proceeding or a different resolution strategy, such as a multiple point of entry resolution strategy for Group Inc. and certain of its material subsidiaries. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n47\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nAssuming Group Inc. entered resolution proceedings and that support from Group Inc. or other available resources to its subsidiaries was sufficient to enable the subsidiaries to remain solvent, losses at the subsidiary level would be transferred to Group Inc. and ultimately borne by Group Inc.\u2019s security holders, third-party creditors of Group Inc.\u2019s subsidiaries would receive full recoveries on their claims, and Group Inc.\u2019s security holders (including our shareholders, debtholders and other unsecured creditors) could face significant and possibly complete losses. In that case, Group Inc.\u2019s security holders would face losses while the third-party creditors of Group Inc.\u2019s subsidiaries would incur no losses because the subsidiaries would continue to operate and would not enter resolution or bankruptcy proceedings. In addition, holders of Group Inc.\u2019s eligible long-term debt and holders of Group Inc.\u2019s other debt securities could face losses ahead of its other similarly situated creditors in a resolution under OLA if the FDIC exercised its right, described above, to disregard the priority of creditor claims. \n \nOLA also provides the FDIC with authority to cause creditors and shareholders of the financial company in receivership to bear losses before taxpayers are exposed to such losses, and amounts owed to the U.S. government would generally receive a statutory payment priority over the claims of private creditors, including senior creditors. \n \nIn addition, under OLA, claims of creditors (including debtholders) could be satisfied through the issuance of equity or other securities in a bridge entity to which Group Inc.\u2019s assets are transferred. If such a \nsecurities-for-claims\n exchange were implemented, there can be no assurance that the value of the securities of the bridge entity would be sufficient to repay or satisfy all or any part of the creditor claims for which the securities were exchanged. While the FDIC has issued regulations to implement OLA, not all aspects of how the FDIC might exercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is possible. \n \n \n \nIn addition, certain jurisdictions, including the U.K. and the E.U., have implemented resolution regimes to provide resolution authorities with the ability to recapitalize a failing entity by writing down its unsecured debt or converting its unsecured debt into equity. Such \n\u201cbail-in\u201d\n powers are intended to enable the recapitalization of a failing institution by allocating losses to its shareholders and unsecured debtholders. For example, the Bank of England requires a certain amount of intercompany funding that we provide to our material U.K. subsidiaries to contain a contractual trigger to expressly permit the Bank of England to exercise such \n\u201cbail-in\u201d\n powers in certain circumstances. If the intercompany funding we provide to our subsidiaries is \u201cbailed in,\u201d Group Inc.\u2019s claims on its subsidiaries would be subordinated to the claims of the subsidiaries\u2019 third-party creditors or written down. U.S. regulators are considering and \nnon-U.S.\n authorities have adopted requirements that certain subsidiaries of large financial institutions maintain minimum amounts of total loss-absorbing capacity that would pass losses up from the subsidiaries to the \ntop-tier\n BHC and, ultimately, to security holders of the \ntop-tier\n BHC in the event of failure. \n \nThe application of Group Inc.\u2019s proposed resolution strategy could result in greater losses for Group Inc.\u2019s security holders. \n \nIn our resolution plan, Group Inc. would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The strategy described in our resolution plan is a variant of the single point of entry strategy: Group Inc. and Goldman Sachs Funding LLC (Funding IHC), a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of Group Inc., would recapitalize and provide liquidity to certain major subsidiaries, including through the forgiveness of intercompany indebtedness, the extension of the maturities of intercompany indebtedness and the extension of additional intercompany loans. If this strategy were successful, creditors of some or all of Group Inc.\u2019s major subsidiaries would receive full recoveries on their claims, while Group Inc.\u2019s security holders could face significant and possibly complete losses. \n \nTo facilitate the execution of our resolution plan, we formed Funding IHC. In exchange for an unsecured subordinated funding note and equity interest, Group Inc. transferred certain intercompany receivables and substantially all of its GCLA to Funding IHC, and agreed to transfer additional GCLA above prescribed thresholds. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n48\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nWe also put in place a Capital and Liquidity Support Agreement (CLSA) among Group Inc., Funding IHC and our major subsidiaries. Under the CLSA, Funding IHC has provided Group Inc. with a committed line of credit that allows Group Inc. to draw sufficient funds to meet its cash needs during the ordinary course of business. In addition, if our financial resources deteriorate so severely that resolution may be imminent, (i)\u00a0the committed line of credit will automatically terminate and the unsecured subordinated funding note will automatically be forgiven, (ii)\u00a0all intercompany receivables owed by the major subsidiaries to Group Inc. will be transferred to Funding IHC or their maturities will be extended to five years, (iii)\u00a0Group Inc. will be obligated to transfer substantially all of its remaining intercompany receivables and GCLA (other than an amount to fund anticipated bankruptcy expenses) to Funding IHC, and (iv)\u00a0Funding IHC will be obligated to provide capital and liquidity support to the major subsidiaries. Group Inc.\u2019s and Funding IHC\u2019s obligations under the CLSA are secured pursuant to a related security agreement. Such actions would materially and adversely affect Group Inc.\u2019s liquidity. As a result, during a period of severe stress, Group Inc. might commence bankruptcy proceedings at an earlier time than it otherwise would if the CLSA and related security agreement had not been implemented. \n \nIf Group Inc.\u2019s proposed resolution strategy were successful, Group Inc.\u2019s security holders could face losses while the third-party creditors of Group Inc.\u2019s major subsidiaries would incur no losses because those subsidiaries would continue to operate and not enter resolution or bankruptcy proceedings. As part of the strategy, Group Inc. could also seek to elevate the priority of its guarantee obligations relating to its major subsidiaries\u2019 derivative contracts or transfer them to another entity so that cross-default and early termination rights would be stayed under the ISDA Protocols, as applicable, which would result in holders of Group Inc.\u2019s eligible long-term debt and holders of Group Inc.\u2019s other debt securities incurring losses ahead of the beneficiaries of those guarantee obligations. It is also possible that holders of Group Inc.\u2019s eligible long-term debt and other debt securities could incur losses ahead of other similarly situated creditors of Group Inc.\u2019s major subsidiaries. \n \nIf Group Inc.\u2019s proposed resolution strategy were not successful, Group Inc.\u2019s financial condition would be adversely impacted and Group Inc.\u2019s security holders, including debtholders, may as a consequence be in a worse position than if the strategy had not been implemented. In all cases, any payments to debtholders are dependent on our ability to make such payments and are therefore subject to our credit risk. \n \n \n \nAs a result of our recovery and resolution planning processes, including incorporating feedback from our regulators, we may incur increased operational, funding or other costs and face limitations on our ability to structure our internal organization or engage in internal or external activities in a manner that we may otherwise deem most operationally efficient. \n \nOur commodities activities, particularly our physical commodities activities, subject us to extensive regulation and involve certain potential risks, including environmental, reputational and other risks that may expose us to significant liabilities and costs. \n \nAs part of our commodities business, we purchase and sell certain physical commodities, arrange for their storage and transport, and engage in market making of commodities. The commodities involved in these activities may include crude oil, refined oil products, natural gas, liquefied natural gas, electric power, agricultural products, metals (base and precious), minerals (including unenriched uranium), emission credits, coal, freight and related products and indices. \n \nWe make investments in and finance entities that engage in the production, storage and transportation of numerous commodities, including many of the commodities referenced above. \n \nThese activities subject us and/or the entities in which we invest to extensive and evolving federal, state and local energy, environmental, antitrust and other governmental laws and regulations worldwide, including environmental laws and regulations relating to, among others, air quality, water quality, waste management, transportation of hazardous substances, natural resources, site remediation and health and safety. Additionally, rising climate change concerns have led to additional regulation that could increase the operating costs and adversely affect the profitability of certain of our investments. \n \nThere may be substantial costs in complying with current or future laws and regulations relating to our commodities-related activities and investments. Compliance with these laws and regulations could require significant commitments of capital toward environmental monitoring, renovation of storage facilities or transport vessels, payment of emission fees and carbon or other taxes, and application for, and holding of, permits and licenses. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n49\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nCommodities involved in our intermediation activities and investments are also subject to the risk of unforeseen or catastrophic events, which are likely to be outside of our control, including those arising from the breakdown or failure of transport vessels, storage facilities or other equipment or processes or other mechanical malfunctions, fires, leaks, spills or release of hazardous substances, performance below expected levels of output or efficiency, terrorist attacks, extreme weather events or other natural disasters or other hostile or catastrophic events. In addition, we rely on third-party suppliers or service providers to perform their contractual obligations and any failure on their part, including the failure to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices or to safely transport or store commodities, could expose us to costs or losses. Also, while we seek to insure against potential risks, we may not be able to obtain insurance to cover some of these risks and the insurance that we have may be inadequate to cover our losses. \n \nThe occurrence of any of such events may prevent us from performing under our agreements with clients, may impair our operations or financial results and may result in litigation, regulatory action, negative publicity or other reputational harm. \n \nWe may also be required to divest or discontinue certain of these activities for regulatory or legal reasons or due to the transition to a less carbon-dependent economy in response to climate change. \n \nCompetition \n \nOur results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by the composition of our client base. \n \nOur client base is not the same as that of our major competitors. Our businesses may have a higher or lower percentage of clients in certain industries or markets than some or all of our competitors. Therefore, unfavorable industry developments or market conditions affecting certain industries or markets have resulted in the past and may result in the future in our businesses underperforming relative to similar businesses of a competitor if our businesses have a higher concentration of clients in such industries or markets. For example, our market-making businesses have a higher percentage of clients with actively managed assets than some of our competitors and such clients have in the past and may in the future be disproportionately affected by low volatility. \n \n \n \nCorrespondingly, favorable or simply less adverse developments or market conditions involving industries or markets in a business where we have a lower concentration of clients in such industry or market have also resulted in the past and may result in the future in our underperforming relative to a similar business of a competitor that has a higher concentration of clients in such industry or market. For example, we have a smaller corporate client base in our market-making businesses than some of our peers and therefore those competitors may benefit more from increased activity by corporate clients. Similarly, we have not historically engaged in retail equities intermediation to the same extent as other financial institutions, which has in the past and could in the future adversely affect our market share in equities execution. \n \nThe financial services industry is highly competitive. \n \nThe financial services industry and all of our businesses are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including transaction execution, our products and services, innovation, reputation, creditworthiness and price. There has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry. This has hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets. As a result, we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions. To the extent we expand into new business areas and new geographic regions, we will face competitors with more experience and more established relationships with clients, regulators and industry participants in the relevant market, which could adversely affect our ability to expand. \n \nGovernments and regulators have adopted regulations, imposed taxes, adopted compensation restrictions or otherwise put forward various proposals that have impacted or may impact our ability to conduct certain of our businesses in a cost-effective manner or at all in certain or all jurisdictions, including proposals relating to restrictions on the type of activities in which financial institutions are permitted to engage. These or other similar rules, many of which do not apply to all our U.S. or \nnon-U.S.\n competitors, could impact our ability to compete effectively. \n \nPricing and other competitive pressures in our businesses have continued to increase, particularly in situations where some of our competitors may seek to increase market share by reducing prices. For example, in connection with investment banking and other assignments, in response to competitive pressure we have experienced, we have extended and priced credit at levels that may not always fully compensate us for the risks we take. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n50\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nThe financial services industry is highly interrelated in that a significant volume of transactions occur among a limited number of members of that industry. Many transactions are syndicated to other financial institutions and financial institutions are often counterparties in transactions. This has led to claims by other market participants and regulators that such institutions have colluded in order to manipulate markets or market prices, including allegations that antitrust laws have been violated. While we have extensive procedures and controls that are designed to identify and prevent such activities, allegations of such activities, particularly by regulators, can have a negative reputational impact and can subject us to large fines and settlements, and potentially significant penalties, including treble damages. \n \nThe growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new products and technologies, including trading technologies and cryptocurrencies, has increased competition. \n \nTechnology is fundamental to our business and our industry. The growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new technologies is changing our businesses and presenting us with new challenges. Securities, futures and options transactions are increasingly occurring electronically, both on our own systems and through other alternative trading systems, and it appears that the trend toward alternative trading systems will continue. Some of these alternative trading systems compete with us, particularly our exchange-based market-making activities, and we may experience continued competitive pressures in these and other areas. In addition, the increased use by our clients of \nlow-cost\n electronic trading systems and direct electronic access to trading markets could cause a reduction in commissions and spreads. As our clients increasingly use our systems to trade directly in the markets, we may incur liabilities as a result of their use of our order routing and execution infrastructure. \n \nWe have invested significant resources into the development of electronic trading systems and expect to continue to do so, but there is no assurance that the revenues generated by these systems will yield an adequate return, particularly given the generally lower commissions arising from electronic trades. \n \n \n \nIn addition, the emergence, adoption and evolution of new technologies, including distributed ledgers, such as cryptocurrencies and blockchain, have required us to invest resources to adapt our existing products and services, and we expect to continue to make such investments, which could be material. The adoption and evolution of such new technologies may also increase our compliance and regulatory costs. Further, technologies, such as cryptocurrencies, that do not require intermediation could also significantly disrupt payments processing and other financial services. Regulatory limitations on our involvement in products and platforms involving technologies such as cryptocurrencies may not apply equally or in some cases at all to certain of our competitors. We may not be as timely or successful in developing or integrating, or even able to develop or integrate, new products and technologies, such as cryptocurrencies, into our existing products and services, adapting to changes in consumer preferences or achieving market acceptance of our products and services, any of which could affect our ability to attract or retain clients, cause us to lose market share or result in service disruptions and in turn reduce our revenues or otherwise adversely affect us. \n \nOur businesses would be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees. \n \nOur performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled people; therefore, our continued ability to compete effectively in our businesses, to manage our businesses effectively and to expand into new businesses and geographic areas depends on our ability to attract new talented and diverse employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees. Factors that affect our ability to attract and retain such employees include the level and composition of our compensation and benefits, and our reputation as a successful business with a culture of fairly hiring, training and promoting qualified employees. As a significant portion of the compensation that we pay to our employees is in the form of \nyear-end\n discretionary compensation, a significant portion of which is in the form of deferred equity-related awards, declines in our profitability, or in the outlook for our future profitability, as well as regulatory limitations on compensation levels and terms, can negatively impact our ability to hire and retain highly qualified employees. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n51\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nCompetition from within the financial services industry and from businesses outside the financial services industry, including the technology industry, for qualified employees has often been intense. We have experienced increased competition in hiring and retaining employees to address the demands of, expanding consumer-oriented businesses and our technology initiatives. This is also the case in emerging and growth markets, where we are often competing for qualified employees with entities that have a significantly greater presence or more extensive experience in the region. \n \nChanges in law or regulation in jurisdictions in which our operations are located that affect taxes on our employees\u2019 income, or the amount or composition of compensation, may also adversely affect our ability to hire and retain qualified employees in those jurisdictions. \n \nAs described further in \u201cBusiness\u00a0\u2014 Regulation\u00a0\u2014 Compensation Practices\u201d in Part\u00a0I, Item\u00a01 of this \nForm\u00a010-K,\n our compensation practices are subject to review by, and the standards of, the FRB. As a large global financial and banking institution, we are subject to limitations on compensation practices (which may or may not affect the companies with which we compete for talent) by the FRB, the PRA, the FCA, the FDIC and other regulators worldwide. These limitations have shaped our compensation practices, which has in some cases adversely affected our ability to attract and retain talented employees, in particular in relation to companies not subject to these limitations, and future legislation or regulation may have similar adverse effects. \n \nOur operating expenses and efficiency ratio depend, in part, on our overall headcount and the proportion of our employees located in strategic locations. Our future human capital resource requirements and the benefits provided by strategic locations are uncertain, and we may not realize the benefits we anticipate. \n \n \n \nMarket Developments and General Business Environment \n \nOur businesses, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations have been and may in the future be adversely affected by the \nCOVID-19\n pandemic. \n \nThe \nCOVID-19\n pandemic created economic and financial disruptions that have in the past adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. The extent to which the \nCOVID-19\n pandemic will negatively affect our businesses, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations will depend on future developments, including the emergence of new variants of \nCOVID-19\n and the effectiveness of vaccines and treatments over the long term and against new variants, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. \n \nWhile financial markets have rebounded from the significant declines that occurred early in the pandemic and global economic conditions generally improved in 2021, certain of the circumstances that arose or became more pronounced after the onset of the \nCOVID-19\n pandemic persisted in 2021, including (i)\u00a0relatively weak consumer confidence; (ii)\u00a0low levels of the federal funds rate and yields on U.S. Treasury securities which, at times, were near zero; (iii)\u00a0ongoing heightened credit risk with regard to industries that have been most severely impacted by the pandemic, including, at times, oil and gas, gaming and lodging, and airlines; (iv)\u00a0significant interest at times by investors in liquidity products, which generate lower fees, relative to risk assets, resulting in these products comprising a higher share of AUS as compared to the \npre-pandemic\n composition; (v)\u00a0higher cyber security, information security and operational risks; and (vi)\u00a0interruptions in the supply chain that have adversely affected many businesses and have contributed to higher rates of inflation. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n52\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nDepending on the duration and severity of the pandemic going forward, as well as the effects of the pandemic on consumer and corporate confidence, the conditions noted above could continue for an extended period and other adverse developments may occur or reoccur, including (i)\u00a0a repeat, or worse, of the decline in the valuation of equity, fixed-income and commodity markets that occurred at the outset of the pandemic; (ii)\u00a0market dislocations that may make hedging strategies less effective or ineffective; (iii)\u00a0a reduction in fees on AUS due to declines in the valuation of assets or a protracted trend toward asset classes that generate lower fees; (iv)\u00a0disruption in the new issuance markets for debt and equity, leading to a decline in underwriting volumes; (v)\u00a0declines in completed mergers and acquisitions; (vi)\u00a0a deterioration in the liquidity profile of corporate borrowers, resulting in additional draws on credit lines; (vii)\u00a0defaults by consumers or corporate clients on loans; (viii)\u00a0changes in consumer spending or borrowing patterns; and (ix)\u00a0greater challenges in valuing derivative positions and associated collateral, leading to significant increases in collateral calls and valuation disputes. \n \nThe effects of the \nCOVID-19\n pandemic on economic and market conditions have in the past and may in the future also increase demands on our liquidity as we meet client needs. Likewise, these adverse developments have in the past and may in the future affect our capital and leverage ratios. The effects of the \nCOVID-19\n pandemic and FRB requirements have in the past limited and may in the future limit capital distributions. \n \nGovernmental authorities worldwide have taken increased measures to stabilize the markets and support economic growth. The continued success of these measures is unknown and they may not be sufficient to address future market dislocations or avert severe and prolonged reductions in economic activity. \n \n \n \nCertain of our businesses, our funding instruments and financial products may be adversely affected by changes in or the discontinuance of Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs), in particular LIBOR. \n \nThe FCA and the administrator of LIBOR have announced that the publication of the most commonly used USD LIBOR settings will cease to be provided or cease to be representative after June\u00a030,\u00a02023. The publication of all other LIBOR settings ceased to be provided or ceased to be representative as of December\u00a031,\u00a02021. The U.S. federal banking agencies had also issued guidance strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using the USD LIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts by December\u00a031,\u00a02021 at the latest. As the transition from LIBOR is ongoing, there continues to be substantial uncertainty as to the ultimate effect of the transition on the financial markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments. Similar developments have occurred with respect to other IBORs. \n \nUncertainty regarding IBORs and the taking of discretionary actions or negotiation or implementation of fallback provisions could result in pricing volatility, loss of market share in certain products, adverse tax or accounting impacts, compliance, legal and operational costs and risks associated with client disclosures, as well as systems disruption, model disruption and other business continuity issues. In addition, uncertainty relating to IBORs could result in increased capital requirements for us given potential low transaction volumes, a lack of liquidity or limited observability for exposures linked to IBORs or any emerging successor rates and operational incidents associated with changes in and the discontinuance of IBORs. \n \nThe language in our contracts and financial instruments that define IBORs, in particular LIBOR, have developed over time and have various events that trigger when a successor rate to the designated rate would be selected. Once a trigger is satisfied, contracts and financial instruments often give the calculation agent (which may be us) discretion over the successor rate or benchmark to be selected. As a result, for the most commonly used USD LIBOR settings, there continues to be considerable uncertainty as to how the financial services industry will address the discontinuance of designated rates in contracts and financial instruments or such designated rates ceasing to be acceptable reference rates. This uncertainty could ultimately result in client disputes and litigation surrounding the proper interpretation of our IBOR-based contracts and financial instruments. For LIBOR settings that ceased to be provided or ceased to be representative as of December\u00a02021, discretionary actions taken in connection with the implementation of fallback provisions could also result in client disputes and litigation particularly for derivatives and other synthetic instruments. Although we have adhered to the ISDA IBOR Fallbacks Protocol, the protocol is applicable to derivatives when both parties adhere to the protocol or otherwise agree for it to apply to their derivatives. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n53\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nFurther, the discontinuation of an IBOR, changes in an IBOR or changes in market acceptance of any IBOR as a reference rate may also adversely affect the yield on loans or securities held by us, amounts paid on securities we have issued, amounts received and paid on derivative instruments we have entered into, the value of such loans, securities or derivative instruments, the trading market for securities, the terms of new loans being made using different or modified reference rates, our ability to effectively use derivative instruments to manage risk, or the availability or cost of our floating-rate funding and our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. \n \nCertain of our businesses and our funding instruments may be adversely affected by changes in other reference rates, currencies, indexes, baskets or ETFs to which products we offer or funding that we raise are linked. \n \nMany of the products that we own or that we offer, such as structured notes, warrants, swaps or security-based swaps, pay interest or determine the principal amount to be paid at maturity or in the event of default by reference to rates or by reference to an index, currency, basket, ETF or other financial metric (the underlier). In the event that the composition of the underlier is significantly changed, by reference to rules governing such underlier or otherwise, the underlier ceases to exist (for example, in the event that a country withdraws from the Euro or links its currency to or delinks its currency from another currency or benchmark, an index or ETF sponsor materially alters the composition of an index or ETF, or stocks in a basket are delisted or become impermissible to be included in the index or ETF), the underlier ceases to be recognized as an acceptable market benchmark or there are legal or regulatory constraints on linking a financial instrument to the underlier, we may experience adverse effects consistent with those described above for IBORs. \n \n \n \nWe face enhanced risks as new business initiatives and acquisitions lead us to engage in new activities, operate in new locations, transact with a broader array of clients and counterparties and expose us to new asset classes and new markets. \n \nA number of our recent and planned business initiatives and expansions of existing businesses, including through acquisitions and partnership arrangements, may bring us into contact, directly or indirectly, with individuals and entities that are not within our traditional client and counterparty base, expose us to new asset classes and new markets, and present us with integration challenges. For example, we continue to transact business and invest in new regions, including a wide range of emerging and growth markets, and we expect this trend to continue. Various emerging and growth market countries have experienced severe economic and financial disruptions, including significant devaluations of their currencies, defaults or threatened defaults on sovereign debt, capital and currency exchange controls, and low or negative growth rates in their economies. The possible effects of any of these conditions include an adverse impact on our businesses and increased volatility in financial markets generally. \n \nFurthermore, in a number of our businesses, including where we make markets, invest and lend, we own interests in, or otherwise become affiliated with the ownership and operation of, public services, such as airports, toll roads and shipping ports, as well as physical commodities and commodities infrastructure components, both within and outside the U.S. \n \nWe have increased and intend to further increase our consumer-oriented deposit-taking and lending activities. For example, we now issue credit cards to consumers and through our pending acquisition of GreenSky, we intend to expand our offering of \npoint-of-sale\n financing. To the extent we engage in those and other consumer-oriented activities, we have faced, and would continue to face, additional compliance, legal and regulatory risk, increased reputational risk and increased operational risk due to, among other things, higher transaction volumes and significantly increased retention and transmission of consumer and client information. Acquisitions and new products can also expose us to new or different types of risks. For example, providing \npoint-of-sale\n financing through GreenSky will also subject us to risks relating to retaining and attracting merchants and servicing loans for other banks, as well as potential liability for remediation costs if merchants fail to fulfill their obligations to consumers. We are also subject to additional legal requirements, including with respect to suitability and consumer protection (for example, Regulation Best Interest, fair lending laws and regulations and privacy laws and regulations). Further, identity fraud may increase and credit reporting practices may change in a manner that makes it more difficult for financial institutions, such as us, to evaluate the creditworthiness of consumers. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n54\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nWe have increased and intend to further increase our transaction banking activities. As a result, we expect to face additional compliance, legal and regulatory risk, including with respect to know-your-customer, anti-money laundering and reporting requirements and prohibitions on transfers of property belonging to countries, entities and individuals subject to sanctions by U.S. or other governmental authorities. \n \nNew business initiatives expose us to new and enhanced risks, including risks associated with dealing with governmental entities, reputational concerns arising from dealing with different types of clients, business partners, counterparties and investors, greater regulatory scrutiny of these activities, increased credit-related, market, sovereign and operational risks, risks arising from accidents or acts of terrorism, and reputational concerns with the manner in which certain assets are being operated or held or in which we interact with these clients, business partners, counterparties and investors. Legal, regulatory and reputational risks may also exist in connection with activities and transactions involving new products or markets where there is regulatory uncertainty or where there are different or conflicting regulations depending on the regulator or the jurisdiction involved, particularly where transactions in such products may involve multiple jurisdictions. \n \nWe have developed and pursued new business and strategic initiatives, including acquisitions, and expect to continue to do so. If and to the extent we are unable to successfully execute those initiatives, we may incur unanticipated costs and losses, and face other adverse consequences, such as negative reputational effects. In addition, the actual effects of pursuing those initiatives may differ, possibly materially, from the benefits that we expect to realize from them, such as generating additional revenues, achieving expense savings, reducing operational risk exposures or using capital and funding more efficiently. Engaging in new activities exposes us to a variety of risks, including that we may be unable to successfully develop new, competitive, efficient and effective systems and processes, and hire and retain the necessary personnel. Due to our lack of historical experience with unsecured consumer lending, our loan loss assumptions may prove to be incorrect and we may incur losses significantly above those which we originally anticipated in entering the business or in expanding the product offerings for the business. \n \nIn recent years, we have invested, and may continue to invest, more in businesses that we expect will generate a higher level of more consistent revenues. In order to develop and be able to offer consumer financial products that compete effectively, we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in technology and human capital resources in connection with our consumer-oriented activities. Such investments and acquisitions may not be successful or have returns similar to our other businesses. \n \n \n \nWe may not be able to fully realize the expected benefits or synergies from acquisitions in the time frames we expect, or at all. \n \nWe have been engaging in selective acquisitions and expect to continue to do so in the future and these acquisitions may, individually or in the aggregate, be material to us. Any future acquisitions could involve the issuance of common stock and/or the payment of cash as consideration. The success of our acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the acquired businesses and realize anticipated synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities. We may face numerous risks and uncertainties in combining and integrating the relevant businesses and systems, including the need to combine or separate accounting and data processing systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with clients, counterparties, regulators and others in connection with acquisitions. Integration of acquired businesses is \ntime-consuming\n and could disrupt our ongoing businesses, produce unforeseen regulatory or operating difficulties, cause us to incur incremental expenses or require incremental financial, management and other resources. It is also possible that an acquisition, once announced, may not close due to the failure to satisfy applicable closing conditions, such as the receipt of necessary shareholder or regulatory approvals. \n \nThere is no assurance that any of our acquisitions will be successfully integrated or yield all of the expected positive benefits and synergies in the time frames that we expect, or at all. If we are not able to integrate our acquisitions successfully, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n55\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

(GreenSky). \n \n \n \nExecutive Overview \n \nWe generated net earnings of $21.64\u00a0billion for 2021, significantly higher compared with $9.46\u00a0billion for 2020. Diluted earnings per common share (EPS) was $59.45 for 2021, significantly higher compared with $24.74 for 2020. Return on average common shareholders\u2019 equity (ROE) was 23.0% for 2021, compared with 11.1% for 2020. Book value per common share was $284.39 as of December\u00a02021,\u00a020.4% higher compared with December\u00a02020. \n \nDuring 2020, we recorded net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings of $3.42\u00a0billion, which reduced diluted EPS by $9.51 and reduced ROE by 3.9 percentage points. \n \nNet revenues were $59.34\u00a0billion for 2021, 33% higher than 2020, reflecting higher net revenues across all segments, including significant increases in Asset Management, Investment Banking and Consumer\u00a0& Wealth Management. Net revenues in Asset Management primarily reflected significantly higher net revenues in Equity investments and Lending and debt investments, net revenues in Investment Banking primarily reflected significantly higher net revenues in Financial advisory and Underwriting, and net revenues in Consumer\u00a0& Wealth Management reflected growth in both Wealth management and Consumer banking net revenues. Net revenues in Global Markets were slightly higher, reflecting significantly higher net revenues in Equities, partially offset by lower net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) compared with a strong prior year. \n \nProvision for credit losses was $357\u00a0million for 2021, compared with $3.10\u00a0billion for 2020. 2021 included provisions related to portfolio growth (primarily in credit cards, including provisions related to the commitment to acquire the General Motors \nco-branded\n credit card portfolio), largely offset by reserve reductions on wholesale and consumer loans reflecting continued improvement in the broader economic environment. This followed challenging conditions in the prior year as a result of the impact of the \nCOVID-19\n pandemic, which contributed to significant provisions in 2020. \n \nOperating expenses were $31.94\u00a0billion for 2021, 10% higher than 2020, primarily reflecting significantly higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting strong performance). In addition, technology expenses and professional fees were significantly higher and transaction based expenses were higher. These increases were partially offset by significantly lower net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings and lower expenses related to consolidated investments (including impairments). Our efficiency ratio (total operating expenses divided by total net revenues) for 2021 was 53.8%, compared with 65.0% for 2020. In 2020, net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings increased our efficiency ratio by 7.6 percentage points. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n59\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nDuring 2021, we returned $7.49\u00a0billion of capital to common shareholders, including $5.20\u00a0billion of common share repurchases and $2.29\u00a0billion of common stock dividends. As of December\u00a02021, our CET1 capital ratio was 14.2% under the Standardized Capital Rules and 14.9% under the Advanced Capital Rules. See Note\u00a020 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our capital ratios. \n \nWe announced two strategic acquisitions during 2021, the pending acquisitions of NN Investment Partners in our Asset Management business and GreenSky in our Consumer banking business. We expect these acquisitions to accelerate our strategy to drive more durable returns. The acquisition of NN Investment Partners is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022, and the acquisition of GreenSky is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022. \n \nIn the first quarter of 2022, we announced that over the medium-term (approximately 3\u00a0years), our target is to achieve (i)\u00a0ROE within a range of 14% to 16%, (ii)\u00a0return on average tangible common shareholders\u2019 equity (ROTE) within a range of 15% to 17% and (iii)\u00a0an efficiency ratio of approximately 60%. In addition, we announced that our target is to maintain capital ratios equal to the regulatory requirements plus a buffer of 50 to 100\u00a0basis points. \n \nBusiness Environment \n \nIn 2021, the global economy continued to recover from the impact of the \nCOVID-19\n pandemic, as the distribution of vaccines helped facilitate an increase in global economic activity. Economic activity continued to benefit from ongoing fiscal stimulus from governments and continued accommodative monetary policy from global central banks. In the second half of the year, the growth in economic activity and demand for goods and services, alongside supply chain complications, contributed to inflationary pressures. Late in the year, the surge in Omicron cases sparked renewed concerns globally, contributing to increased market volatility and increased pressures on labor supply. This may result in a negative impact on economic activity. \n \nDespite broad improvements in the overall economy since the initial impact of the \nCOVID-19\n pandemic, uncertainty remains on the pace of the recovery going forward, reflecting concerns about virus resurgence from the Omicron variant and other possible variants and related concerns regarding vaccine distribution, efficacy and hesitancy, as well as concerns relating to inflation, supply chain complications and geopolitical risks. See \u201cResults of Operations \u2014 Segment Assets and Operating Results \u2014 Segment Operating Results\u201d for further information about the operating environment for each of our business segments. \n \n \n \nCritical Accounting Policies \n \nFair Value \n \nFair Value Hierarchy.\n Trading assets and liabilities, certain investments and loans, and certain other financial assets and liabilities, are included in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value (i.e., \nmarked-to-market),\n with related gains or losses generally recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings. The use of fair value to measure financial instruments is fundamental to our risk management practices and is our most critical accounting policy. \n \nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We measure certain financial assets and liabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to market and/or credit risks).\u00a0In determining fair value, the hierarchy under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) gives (i)\u00a0the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities (level\u00a01 inputs), (ii) the next priority to inputs other than level\u00a01 inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly (level\u00a02 inputs), and (iii)\u00a0the lowest priority to inputs that cannot be observed in market activity (level\u00a03 inputs). In evaluating the significance of a valuation input, we consider, among other factors, a portfolio\u2019s net risk exposure to that input. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to their fair value measurement. \n \nThe fair values for substantially all of our financial assets and liabilities are based on observable prices and inputs and are classified in levels\u00a01 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain level\u00a02 and level\u00a03 financial assets and liabilities may require appropriate valuation adjustments that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value for factors, such as counterparty and our credit quality, funding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity and bid/offer spreads. \n \nInstruments classified in level\u00a03 of the fair value hierarchy are those which require one or more significant inputs that are not observable. Level\u00a03 financial assets represented 1.6% as of December\u00a02021 and 2.3% as of December\u00a02020, of our total assets. See Notes\u00a04 through 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about level\u00a03 financial assets, including changes in level\u00a03 financial assets and related fair value measurements. Absent evidence to the contrary, instruments classified in level\u00a03 of the fair value hierarchy are initially valued at transaction price, which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value. Subsequent to the transaction date, we use other methodologies to determine fair value, which vary based on the type of instrument. Estimating the fair value of level\u00a03 financial instruments requires judgments to be made. These judgments include: \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nDetermining the appropriate valuation methodology and/or model for each type of level\u00a03 financial instrument; \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n60\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Our control infrastructure is independent of the revenue-producing units and is fundamental to ensuring that all of our financial instruments are appropriately valued at market-clearing levels. In the event that there is a difference of opinion in situations where estimating the fair value of financial instruments requires judgment (e.g., calibration to market comparables or trade comparison, as described below), the final valuation decision is made by senior managers in independent risk oversight and control functions. This independent price verification is critical to ensuring that our financial instruments are properly valued. \n \nPrice Verification.\n All financial instruments at fair value classified in levels\u00a01, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy are subject to our independent price verification process. The objective of price verification is to have an informed and independent opinion with regard to the valuation of financial instruments under review. Instruments that have one or more significant inputs which cannot be corroborated by external market data are classified in level\u00a03 of the fair value hierarchy. Price verification strategies utilized by our independent risk oversight and control functions include: \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nTrade Comparison.\n Analysis of trade data (both internal and external, where available) is used to determine the most relevant pricing inputs and valuations. \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nExternal Price Comparison.\n Valuations and prices are compared to pricing data obtained from third parties (e.g., brokers or dealers, IHS Markit, Bloomberg, IDC, TRACE). Data obtained from various sources is compared to ensure consistency and validity. When broker or dealer quotations or third-party pricing vendors are used for valuation or price verification, greater priority is generally given to executable quotations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nCalibration to Market Comparables.\n Market-based transactions are used to corroborate the valuation of positions with similar characteristics, risks and components. \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nRelative Value Analyses.\n Market-based transactions are analyzed to determine the similarity, measured in terms of risk, liquidity and return, of one instrument relative to another or, for a given instrument, of one maturity relative to another. \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nCollateral Analyses.\n Margin calls on derivatives are analyzed to determine implied values, which are used to corroborate our valuations. \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nExecution of Trades.\n Where appropriate, market-making desks are instructed to execute trades in order to provide evidence of market-clearing levels. \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nBacktesting.\n Valuations are corroborated by comparison to values realized upon sales. \n \n \n \n \n \nSee Note\u00a04 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about fair value measurements. \n \nReview of Net Revenues.\n Independent risk oversight and control functions ensure adherence to our pricing policy through a combination of daily procedures, including the explanation and attribution of net revenues based on the underlying factors. Through this process, we independently validate net revenues, identify and resolve potential fair value or trade booking issues on a timely basis and seek to ensure that risks are being properly categorized and quantified. \n \nReview of Valuation Models.\n Our independent model risk management group (Model Risk), consisting of quantitative professionals who are separate from model developers, performs an independent model review and validation process of our valuation models. New or changed models are reviewed and approved prior to implementation. Models are reviewed annually to assess the impact of any changes in the product or market and any market developments in pricing theories. See \u201cRisk Management\u00a0\u2014\n \nModel Risk Management\u201d for further information about the review and validation of our valuation models. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n61\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis \n \n\u00a0\n \nAllowance for Credit Losses \n \n \nWe estimate and record an allowance for credit losses related to our loans held for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost. To determine the allowance for credit losses, we classify our loans accounted for at amortized cost into wholesale and consumer portfolios. These portfolios represent the level at which we have developed and documented our methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics using a modeled approach and asset-specific basis for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics. \n \nThe allowance for credit losses takes into account the weighted average of a range of forecasts of future economic conditions over the expected life of the loans and lending commitments. The expected life of each loan or lending commitment is determined based on the contractual term adjusted for extension options or demand features, or is modeled in the case of revolving credit card loans. The forecasts include baseline, favorable and adverse economic scenarios over a three-year period. For loans with expected lives beyond three years, the model reverts to historical loss information based on a \nnon-linear\n modeled approach. We apply judgment in weighting individual scenarios each quarter based on a variety of factors, including our internally derived economic outlook, market consensus, recent macroeconomic conditions and industry trends. The forecasted economic scenarios consider a number of risk factors relevant to the wholesale and consumer portfolios. Risk factors for wholesale loans include internal credit ratings, industry default and loss data, expected life, macroeconomic indicators (e.g., unemployment rates and GDP), the borrower\u2019s capacity to meet its financial obligations, the borrower\u2019s country of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateral type. In addition, for loans backed by real estate, risk factors include \nloan-to-value\n ratio, debt service ratio and home price index. Risk factors for installment and credit card loans include Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores, delinquency status, loan vintage and macroeconomic indicators. \n \nThe allowance for credit losses also includes qualitative components which allow management to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting, capture uncertainty regarding model inputs, and account for model imprecision and concentration risk. \n \n \n \nOur estimate of credit losses entails judgment about collectability at the reporting dates, and there are uncertainties inherent in those judgments. The allowance for credit losses is subject to a governance process that involves review and approval by senior management within our independent risk oversight and control functions. Personnel within our independent risk oversight and control functions are responsible for forecasting the economic variables that underlie the economic scenarios that are used in the modeling of expected credit losses. While we use the best information available to determine this estimate, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on, among other things, changes in the economic environment or variances between actual results and the original assumptions used. Loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when deemed to be uncollectible. \n \nWe also record an allowance for credit losses on lending commitments which are held for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost. Such allowance is determined using the same methodology as the allowance for loan losses, while also taking into consideration the probability of drawdowns or funding, and whether such commitments are cancellable by us. \n \nTo estimate the potential impact of an adverse macroeconomic environment on our allowance for credit losses, we, among other things, compared the expected credit losses under the weighted average forecast used in the calculation of allowance for credit losses as of December\u00a02021 (which was primarily weighted towards the baseline economic scenario) to the expected credit losses under a 100% weighted adverse economic scenario. The adverse macroeconomic model assumes an emergence of new vaccine-resistant strains of \nCOVID-19\n resulting in a resurgence of infections, an economic contraction, high inflation rates in the initial quarters, gradually climbing unemployment rates, decline in GDP growth rates and dislocations in the economy due to shortages in the supply of some goods and services. A 100% weighting to the adverse economic scenario would have resulted in an approximate $1.3\u00a0billion increase in our allowance for credit losses as of December\u00a02021. This hypothetical increase does not take into consideration any potential adjustments to qualitative reserves. The forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain and do not take into account any other offsetting or correlated effects. The actual credit loss in an adverse macroeconomic environment may differ significantly from this estimate. See Note\u00a09 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the allowance for credit losses. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n62\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nUse of Estimates \n \nU.S. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions. In addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements and the allowance for credit losses on loans and lending commitments held for investment and accounted for at amortized cost, the use of estimates and assumptions is also important in determining the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, provisions for losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings (including governmental investigations), and accounting for income taxes. \n \nGoodwill is assessed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist. When assessing goodwill for impairment, first, a qualitative assessment can be made to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its estimated carrying value. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is performed. Alternatively, a quantitative goodwill test can be performed without performing a qualitative assessment. Estimating the fair value of our reporting units requires judgment. Critical inputs to the fair value estimates include projected earnings and allocated equity. There is inherent uncertainty in the projected earnings. The estimated carrying value of each reporting unit reflects an allocation of total shareholders\u2019 equity and represents the estimated amount of total shareholders\u2019 equity required to support the activities of the reporting unit under currently applicable regulatory capital requirements. See Note\u00a012 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about goodwill. If we experience a prolonged or severe period of weakness in the business environment, financial markets, our performance or our common stock price, or additional increases in capital requirements, our goodwill could be impaired in the future. \n \nIdentifiable intangible assets are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset\u2019s or asset group\u2019s carrying value may not be fully recoverable. Judgment is required to evaluate whether indications of potential impairment have occurred, and to test intangible assets for impairment, if required. An impairment is recognized if the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value. See Note\u00a012 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about identifiable intangible assets. \n \n \n \nWe also estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we estimate the upper end of the range of reasonably possible aggregate loss in excess of the related reserves for litigation and regulatory proceedings where we believe the risk of loss is more than slight. See Notes\u00a018 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements for information about certain judicial, litigation and regulatory proceedings. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different. Our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a \ncase-by-case\n basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, proceeding or investigation, our experience and the experience of others in similar cases, proceedings or investigations, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. \n \nIn accounting for income taxes, we recognize tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. As of December\u00a02021, our net liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $1.16\u00a0billion. We use estimates to recognize current and deferred income taxes in the U.S. federal, state and local and \nnon-U.S.\n jurisdictions in which we operate. The income tax laws in these jurisdictions are complex and can be subject to different interpretations between taxpayers and taxing authorities. Disputes may arise over these interpretations and can be settled by audit, administrative appeals or judicial proceedings.\u00a0Our interpretations are reevaluated quarterly based on guidance currently available, tax examination experience and the opinions of legal counsel, among other factors. We recognize deferred taxes based on the amount that will more likely than not be realized in the future based on enacted income tax laws. As of December\u00a02021, we had $6.32\u00a0billion of deferred tax assets with a related valuation allowance of $895\u00a0million. Our estimate for deferred taxes includes estimates for future taxable earnings, including the level and character of those earnings, and various tax planning strategies.\u00a0See Note\u00a024 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about income taxes. \n \nRecent Accounting Developments \n \nSee Note\u00a03 to the consolidated financial statements for information about Recent Accounting Developments. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n63\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nOperating Environment.\n During 2021, a general recovery of the global economy, continued monetary and fiscal support from central banks and governments and accelerating vaccine distribution provided a favorable market backdrop. These factors contributed to generally higher global equity prices and tighter credit spreads compared with the end of 2020. In addition, market-making activities reflected strong client activity levels, although activity declined from a very strong prior year which reflected heightened volatility and significant market dislocations as a result of the \nCOVID-19\n pandemic, and investment banking activity levels across mergers and acquisitions and underwriting were elevated. \n \nIf concerns about the economic outlook, including those on inflation and supply chain issues, grow or the ongoing efforts to mitigate the impact of the \nCOVID-19\n pandemic are ineffective (including due to new variants or complications with vaccine distribution, efficacy and hesitancy), it may lead to a decline in global equity markets, a decline in investment banking activity levels, and a continued decline in market-making activity levels, and net revenues and the provision for credit losses would likely be negatively impacted. See \u201cSegment Assets and Operating Results\u00a0\u2014 Segment Operating Results\u201d for information about the operating environment and material trends and uncertainties that may impact our results of operations. \n \n2021 versus 2020.\n Net revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $59.34\u00a0billion for 2021, 33% higher than 2020, reflecting significantly higher other principal transactions revenues, investment banking revenues and net interest income, and higher investment management revenues. \n \n \n \nNon-Interest\n Revenues.\n Investment banking revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $14.17\u00a0billion for 2021, 55% higher than 2020, due to significantly higher revenues in financial advisory, reflecting a significant increase in completed mergers and acquisitions volumes, in equity underwriting, primarily driven by strong industry-wide initial public offerings activity, and in debt underwriting, primarily reflecting elevated industry-wide leveraged finance activity. \n \nInvestment management revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $8.06\u00a0billion for 2021, 16% higher than 2020, primarily due to higher management and other fees, reflecting the impact of higher average AUS, partially offset by higher fee waivers on money market funds. In addition, incentive fees were significantly higher, primarily driven by harvesting. \n \nCommissions and fees in the consolidated statements of earnings were $3.62\u00a0billion for 2021, slightly higher than 2020. \n \nMarket making revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $15.35\u00a0billion for 2021, essentially unchanged compared with 2020, as significantly lower revenues in interest rate products and credit products were largely offset by significantly higher revenues in equity products (primarily in derivatives) and commodities, and improved results in mortgages. \n \nOther principal transactions revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $11.67\u00a0billion for 2021, compared with $4.65\u00a0billion for 2020, primarily reflecting significantly higher net gains from investments in private equities and in debt instruments, partially offset by net losses from investments in public equities compared with significant net gains in 2020. \n \nNet Interest Income.\n Net interest income in the consolidated statements of earnings was $6.47\u00a0billion for 2021, 36% higher than 2020, reflecting a decrease in interest expense, partially offset by a decrease in interest income. The decrease in interest expense is primarily related to other interest-bearing liabilities, deposits and long-term borrowings, each reflecting the impact of lower interest rates. The decrease in interest income primarily related to collateralized agreements and trading assets, both reflecting the impact of lower interest rates, partially offset by the impact of higher average balances for loans.

This followed challenging conditions in the prior year as a result of the \nCOVID-19\n pandemic, which contributed to significant provisions in 2020. \n \nOperating Expenses \n \nOur operating expenses are primarily influenced by compensation, headcount and levels of business activity. Compensation and benefits includes salaries, \nyear-end\n discretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such as benefits. Discretionary compensation is significantly impacted by, among other factors, the level of net revenues net of provision for credit losses, overall financial performance, prevailing labor markets, business mix, the structure of our share-based compensation programs and the external environment. \n \nThe table below presents our operating expenses by line item and headcount. \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nYear Ended December\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n$ in\u00a0millions\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2019\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nCompensation and benefits\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$17,719\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$13,309\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$12,353\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nTransaction based\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4,710\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4,141\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3,513\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nMarket development\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n553\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n401\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n739\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nCommunications and technology\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,573\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,347\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,167\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nDepreciation and amortization\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2,015\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,902\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,704\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nOccupancy\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n981\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n960\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,029\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nProfessional fees\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,648\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,306\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,316\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nOther expenses\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2,739\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5,617\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3,077\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nTotal operating expenses\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$31,938\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$28,983\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$24,898\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \nHeadcount at \nperiod-end\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n43,900\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n40,500\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n38,300\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n2021 versus 2020.\n Operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were $31.94\u00a0billion for 2021, 10% higher than 2020. Our efficiency ratio for 2021 was 53.8%, compared with 65.0% for 2020. In 2020, net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings increased our efficiency ratio by 7.6 percentage points. \n \n \n \nThe increase in operating expenses compared with 2020 primarily reflected significantly higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting strong performance). In addition, technology expenses and professional fees were significantly higher and transaction based expenses were higher. These increases were partially offset by significantly lower net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings and lower expenses related to consolidated investments (including impairments). \n \nNet provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings for 2021 were $534\u00a0million compared with $3.42\u00a0billion for 2020. \n \nCharitable contributions to Goldman Sachs Gives were approximately $250\u00a0million for 2021. \n \nAs of December\u00a02021, headcount increased 8% compared with December\u00a02020, reflecting investments in new business initiatives and an increase in technology professionals. \n \nProvision for Taxes \n \nThe effective income tax rate for 2021 was 20.0%, down from the full year income tax rate of 24.2% for 2020, primarily due to a decrease in provisions for \nnon-deductible\n litigation, partially offset by a decrease in the impact of tax benefits in 2021 compared with 2020. \n \nIn March\u00a02021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Rescue Plan) was signed into law. The Rescue Plan is a $1.9\u00a0trillion stimulus package enacted to help address the economic and health impacts of the \nCOVID-19\n pandemic. The Rescue Plan includes a repeal of a provision under which U.S. affiliated groups could elect a worldwide allocation of interest expense for foreign tax credit limitation purposes for one year beginning in January\u00a02021. Additionally, beginning in 2027, the limitation on corporate tax deductions for compensation payable to the CEO, CFO and the top three highest paid employees will be expanded to include the next five highest paid employees. The legislation did not have a material impact on our 2021 annual effective tax rate and is not expected to have a material impact on our 2022 annual effective tax rate. \n \nIn April\u00a02021, the New York State (NYS) FY 2022 budget was enacted. The legislation temporarily increased the NYS corporate income tax rate from 6.5% to 7.25% for calendar years 2021 through 2023. The legislation did not have a material impact on our 2021 annual effective tax rate and is not expected to have a material impact on our 2022 annual effective tax rate. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n66\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

During 2021, U.K. deferred tax assets and liabilities were remeasured and a deferred tax benefit of approximately $100\u00a0million was recognized. The Finance (No.\u00a02) Bill \n2021-22,\n issued in November\u00a02021, includes a five percent reduction in the U.K. bank surcharge tax rate, effective from April\u00a02023. The bank surcharge is currently applicable to certain of our U.K. subsidiaries and branches, including Goldman Sachs International (GSI) and Goldman Sachs International Bank (GSIB). Following Royal Assent, the associated impact of any change to the bank surcharge on U.K. deferred tax assets and liabilities could have a material impact on our effective tax rate, depending on the operating results for the quarter during which this legislation is enacted. \n \nWe expect our tax rate for 2022 to be between 20% and 21%, excluding the impact of income tax benefits on employee share-based awards and any potential changes in current income tax rates. \n \nSegment Assets and Operating Results \n \nSegment Assets.\n The table below presents assets by segment. \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs of December\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n$ in\u00a0millions\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nInvestment Banking\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n144,157\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n116,242\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nGlobal Markets\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,082,378\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n844,606\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nAsset Management\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n91,115\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n95,751\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nConsumer\u00a0& Wealth Management\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n146,338\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n106,429\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nTotal\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$1,463,988\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$1,163,028\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \nThe allocation process for segment assets is based on the activities of these segments.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nOperating Environment.\n During 2021, Investment Banking operated in an environment characterized by strong industry-wide activity. In mergers and acquisitions, industry-wide completed and announced volumes were at high levels, reflecting supportive market conditions and strong CEO confidence. In underwriting, industry-wide activity levels reflected continued strength in equity underwriting volumes, including strong initial public offerings activity, and solid debt underwriting volumes, including elevated leveraged finance activity. \n \nIn the future, if market and economic conditions deteriorate, and industry-wide mergers and acquisitions volumes decline, or if industry-wide equity and debt underwriting volumes decline, or credit spreads related to hedges on our relationship lending portfolio tighten further, net revenues in Investment Banking would likely be negatively impacted. In addition, a deterioration in the creditworthiness of borrowers would negatively impact the provision for credit losses. \n \n2021 versus 2020.\n Net revenues in Investment Banking were $14.88\u00a0billion for 2021, 58% higher than 2020, primarily reflecting significantly higher net revenues in Financial advisory and Underwriting. \n \nThe increase in Financial advisory net revenues reflected a significant increase in completed mergers and acquisitions volumes. The increase in Underwriting net revenues was due to significantly higher net revenues in both Equity underwriting, primarily driven by strong industry-wide initial public offerings activity, and Debt underwriting, primarily reflecting elevated industry-wide leveraged finance activity. Corporate lending net revenues were significantly higher, primarily reflecting net gains from lending activities compared with net losses in the prior year, and significantly higher net interest income. \n \nProvision for credit losses was a net benefit of $298\u00a0million for 2021, compared with net provisions of $1.62\u00a0billion for 2020, primarily due to reserve reductions in the current year reflecting continued improvement in the broader economic environment following challenging conditions in 2020 resulting from the \nCOVID-19\n pandemic. \n \nOperating expenses were $6.71\u00a0billion for 2021, 9% higher than 2020, due to significantly higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting strong performance), partially offset by significantly lower net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings. \nPre-tax\n earnings were $8.47\u00a0billion for 2021, compared with $1.67\u00a0billion for 2020. ROE was 64.8% for 2021, compared with 10.5% for 2020 (which included the impact of net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings that reduced ROE by 11.5 percentage points). \n \n \n \nAs of December\u00a02021, our investment banking transaction backlog increased significantly compared with December\u00a02020, due to significantly higher estimated net revenues from potential financial advisory transactions and potential debt underwriting transactions (particularly from leveraged finance transactions), and higher estimated net revenues from potential equity underwriting transactions.\n \n \n \nOur backlog represents an estimate of our net revenues from future transactions where we believe that future revenue realization is more likely than not. We believe changes in our backlog may be a useful indicator of client activity levels which, over the long term, impact our net revenues. However, the time frame for completion and corresponding revenue recognition of transactions in our backlog varies based on the nature of the assignment, as certain transactions may remain in our backlog for longer periods of time. In addition, our backlog is subject to certain limitations, such as assumptions about the likelihood that individual client transactions will occur in the future. Transactions may be cancelled or modified, and transactions not included in the estimate may also occur. \n \nGlobal Markets \n \nOur Global Markets segment consists of: \n \nFICC.\n \nFICC generates revenues from intermediation and financing activities. \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nFICC intermediation.\n Includes client execution activities related to making markets in both cash and derivative instruments, as detailed below. \n \n \n \n \n \nInterest Rate Products.\n Government bonds (including inflation-linked securities) across maturities, other government-backed securities, and interest rate swaps, options and other derivatives. \n \nCredit Products.\n Investment-grade and high-yield corporate securities, credit derivatives, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), bank and bridge loans, municipal securities, emerging market and distressed debt, and trade claims. \n \nMortgages.\n Commercial mortgage-related securities, loans and derivatives, residential mortgage-related securities, loans and derivatives (including U.S. government agency-issued collateralized mortgage obligations and other securities and loans), and other asset-backed securities, loans and derivatives. \n \nCurrencies.\n Currency options, spot/forwards and other derivatives on \nG-10\n currencies and emerging-market products. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n69\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

We earn fees by providing clearing, settlement and custody services globally. We provide services that principally involve borrowing and lending securities to cover institutional clients\u2019 short sales and borrowing securities to cover our short sales and to make deliveries into the market. In addition, we are an active participant in \nbroker-to-broker\n securities lending and third-party agency lending activities. We provide financing to our clients for their securities trading activities through margin loans that are collateralized by securities, cash or other acceptable collateral. In addition, we execute swap transactions to provide our clients with exposure to securities and indices. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMarket-Making Activities \n \nAs a market maker, we facilitate transactions in both liquid and less liquid markets, primarily for institutional clients, such as corporations, financial institutions, investment funds and governments, to assist clients in meeting their investment objectives and in managing their risks. In this role, we seek to earn the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing to sell an instrument to us and the price at which another market participant is willing to buy it from us, and vice versa (i.e., bid/offer spread). In addition, we maintain (i)\u00a0market-making positions, typically for a short period of time, in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand, and (ii)\u00a0positions to actively manage our risk exposures that arise from these market-making activities (collectively, inventory). Our inventory is recorded in trading assets (long positions) or trading liabilities (short positions) in our consolidated balance sheets. \n \nOur results are influenced by a combination of interconnected drivers, including (i)\u00a0client activity levels and transactional bid/offer spreads (collectively, client activity), and (ii)\u00a0changes in the fair value of our inventory and interest income and interest expense related to the holding, hedging and funding of our inventory (collectively, market-making inventory changes). Due to the integrated nature of our market-making activities, disaggregation of net revenues into client activity and market-making inventory changes is judgmental and has inherent complexities and limitations. \n \nThe amount and composition of our net revenues vary over time as these drivers are impacted by multiple interrelated factors affecting economic and market conditions, including volatility and liquidity in the market, changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit spreads, equity prices and commodity prices, investor confidence, and other macroeconomic concerns and uncertainties. \n \nIn general, assuming all other market-making conditions remain constant, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads tend to result in increases in net revenues, and decreases tend to have the opposite effect. However, changes in market-making conditions can materially impact client activity levels and bid/offer spreads, as well as the fair value of our inventory. For example, a decrease in liquidity in the market could have the impact of (i)\u00a0increasing our bid/offer spread, (ii)\u00a0decreasing investor confidence and thereby decreasing client activity levels, and (iii)\u00a0widening of credit spreads on our inventory positions. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n70\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In addition, global equity prices were generally higher compared with the end of 2020, as the S&P\u00a0500 Index increased by 27% and the MSCI World Index increased by 17%. Market volatility continued to moderate from elevated levels last year, as the average daily VIX was 33% lower than 2020. If macroeconomic conditions lead to a continued decline in activity levels or continued decline in volatility, net revenues in Global Markets would likely be negatively impacted. \n \n2021 versus 2020.\n Net revenues in Global Markets were $22.08\u00a0billion for 2021, 4% higher than 2020. \n \nNet revenues in FICC were $10.58\u00a0billion, 9% lower than 2020, due to lower net revenues in FICC intermediation, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in interest rate products and credit products and slightly lower net revenues in currencies, partially offset by significantly higher net revenues in mortgages and higher net revenues in commodities. Net revenues in FICC financing were significantly higher, reflecting significantly higher net revenues from mortgage lending, partially offset by significantly lower net revenues from resale agreements. \n \nThe decrease in FICC intermediation net revenues reflected strong but significantly lower client activity compared with very strong activity levels in the prior year due to high volatility amid the \nCOVID-19\n pandemic. This was partially offset by the impact of improved market-making conditions on our inventory compared with challenging conditions in the prior year.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nNet revenues in Equities were $11.49\u00a0billion,\u00a020% higher than 2020, due to significantly higher net revenues in Equities financing, primarily reflecting increased activity (including higher average client balances), and higher net revenues in Equities intermediation, across both derivatives and cash products. \n \nProvision for credit losses was $45\u00a0million for 2021, compared with $274\u00a0million for 2020, primarily reflecting reserve reductions in the current year due to continued improvement in the broader economic environment following challenging conditions in 2020 resulting from the \nCOVID-19\n pandemic, partially offset by portfolio growth. \n \nOperating expenses were $12.97\u00a0billion for 2021, essentially unchanged compared with 2020, as higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting strong performance) and higher transaction based expenses were offset by significantly lower net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings. \nPre-tax\n earnings were $9.06\u00a0billion, 12% higher than 2020. ROE was 15.3% for 2021, compared with 14.1% for 2020 (which included the impact of net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings that reduced ROE by 4.0 percentage points). \n \nAsset Management \n \nWe manage client assets across a broad range of investment strategies and asset classes for a diverse set of institutional clients and a network of third-party distributors around the world, including equity, fixed income and alternative investments. We provide investment solutions including those managed on a fiduciary basis by our portfolio managers, as well as those managed by third-party managers. We offer our investment solutions in a variety of structures, including separately managed accounts, mutual funds, private partnerships and other commingled vehicles. These solutions begin with identifying clients\u2019 objectives and continue through portfolio construction, ongoing asset allocation and risk management and investment realization. \n \nIn addition to managing client assets, we invest in alternative investments across a range of asset classes that seek to deliver long-term accretive risk-adjusted returns. Our investing activities, which are typically longer term, include investments in corporate equity, credit, real estate and infrastructure assets. \n \nAsset Management generates revenues from the following: \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nManagement and other fees. \nThe majority of revenues in management and other fees consists\n \nof asset-based fees on client assets that we manage. For further information about AUS, see \u201cAssets Under Supervision\u201d below. The fees that we charge vary by asset class, distribution channel and the types of services provided, and are affected by investment performance, as well as asset inflows and redemptions.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nIncentive fees.\n In certain circumstances, we also receive incentive fees based on a percentage of a fund\u2019s or a separately managed account\u2019s return, or when the return exceeds a specified benchmark or other performance targets. Such fees include overrides, which consist of the increased share of the income and gains derived primarily from our private equity and credit funds when the return on a fund\u2019s investments over the life of the fund exceeds certain threshold returns. \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nEquity investments.\n Our alternative investing activities relate to public and private equity investments in corporate, real estate and infrastructure entities. We also make investments through consolidated investment entities (CIEs), substantially all of which are engaged in real estate investment activities. \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nLending and debt investments.\n We invest in corporate debt and provide financing for real estate and other assets.

If optimism about the economic outlook declines or the ongoing efforts to mitigate the impact of the \nCOVID-19\n pandemic are ineffective, it may lead to a decline in asset prices, widening of credit spreads, and investors transitioning to asset classes that typically generate lower fees or investors withdrawing their assets, and net revenues in Asset Management would likely be negatively impacted. \n \n2021 versus 2020.\n Net revenues in Asset Management were $14.92\u00a0billion for 2021, 87% higher than 2020, primarily reflecting significantly higher net revenues in Equity investments and Lending and debt investments. \n \nThe increase in Equity investments net revenues reflected significantly higher net gains from investments in private equities, driven by company-specific events and improved corporate performance compared with 2020, partially offset by net losses from investments in public equities compared with significant net gains in the prior year. \n \nThe increase in Lending and debt investments net revenues reflected net gains from investments in debt instruments compared with net losses in the prior year, and significantly higher net interest income. \n \nIncentive fees were higher, primarily driven by harvesting, and Management and other fees were slightly higher, reflecting the impact of higher average assets under supervision, partially offset by higher fee waivers on money market funds. \n \nProvision for credit losses was $18\u00a0million for 2021, compared with $442\u00a0million for 2020, primarily due to reserve reductions in the current year reflecting continued improvement in the broader economic environment following challenging conditions in 2020 resulting from the \nCOVID-19\n pandemic. \n \nOperating expenses were $5.97\u00a0billion for 2021, 16% higher than 2020, primarily due to significantly higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting strong performance), partially offset by lower expenses related to consolidated investments (including impairments). \nPre-tax\n earnings were $8.93\u00a0billion for 2021, compared with $2.40\u00a0billion for 2020. ROE was 28.0% for 2021, compared with 8.5% for 2020. \n \n \n \nConsumer\u00a0& Wealth Management \n \nConsumer\u00a0& Wealth Management helps clients achieve their individual financial goals by providing a broad range of wealth advisory and banking services, including financial planning, investment management, deposit-taking and lending.

Environment.\n During 2021, improved market and economic conditions contributed to a more favorable backdrop for consumer banking and wealth management activities. Global equity prices were generally higher and, in the U.S., unemployment decreased and consumer spending increased compared with 2020, aided by optimism about the economic recovery and continued support from central banks and governments globally. If optimism about the economic outlook declines or the ongoing efforts to mitigate the impact of the \nCOVID-19\n pandemic are ineffective, it may lead to a decline in asset prices, investors favoring asset classes that typically generate lower fees, investors withdrawing their assets and consumers withdrawing their deposits or deterioration in consumer credit, net revenues and the provision for credit losses in Consumer\u00a0& Wealth Management would likely be negatively impacted. \n \n2021 versus 2020.\n Net revenues in Consumer\u00a0& Wealth Management were $7.47\u00a0billion for 2021, 25% higher than 2020. \n \nNet revenues in Wealth management were $5.98\u00a0billion, 25% higher than 2020, due to significantly higher Management and other fees, primarily reflecting the impact of higher average assets under supervision, and significantly higher net revenues in Private banking and lending, primarily reflecting higher loan balances. In addition, Incentive fees were higher, primarily due to harvesting. \n \nNet revenues in Consumer banking were $1.49\u00a0billion, 23% higher than 2020, reflecting higher credit card and deposit balances. \n \nProvision for credit losses was $592\u00a0million for 2021, 22% lower than 2020, primarily due to reserve reductions in the current year reflecting continued improvement in the broader economic environment following challenging conditions in 2020, partially offset by growth in credit card balances, including approximately $185\u00a0million of provisions related to the commitment to acquire the General Motors \nco-branded\n credit card portfolio. \n \nOperating expenses were $6.29\u00a0billion for 2021, 28% higher than 2020, primarily reflecting significantly higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting strong performance). \nPre-tax\n earnings were $584\u00a0million for 2021, 73% higher than 2020.

These incentive fees are recognized when it is probable that a significant reversal of such fees will not occur. Our estimated unrecognized incentive fees were $3.39\u00a0billion as of December\u00a02021 and $1.79\u00a0billion as of December\u00a02020. Such amounts are based on the completion of the funds\u2019 financial statements, which is generally one quarter in arrears. These fees will be recognized, assuming no decline in fair value, if and when it is probable that a significant reversal of such fees will not occur, which is generally when such fees are no longer subject to fluctuations in the market value of the assets. \n \nOur firmwide management and other fees were $7.57\u00a0billion for 2021, $6.67\u00a0billion for 2020 and $6.08\u00a0billion for 2019. In the first quarter of 2022, we announced that our target is to achieve management and other fees of more than $10\u00a0billion (including more than $2\u00a0billion from alternative AUS) in 2024. \n

AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis \n \n\u00a0\n \nBalance Sheet and Funding Sources \n \nBalance Sheet Management \n \n \nOne of our risk management disciplines is our ability to manage the size and composition of our balance sheet. While our asset base changes due to client activity, market fluctuations and business opportunities, the size and composition of our balance sheet also reflects factors, including (i)\u00a0our overall risk tolerance, (ii)\u00a0the amount of capital we hold and (iii)\u00a0our funding profile, among other factors. See \u201cCapital Management and Regulatory Capital\u00a0\u2014 Capital Management\u201d for information about our capital management process. \n \nAlthough our balance sheet fluctuates on a \nday-to-day\n basis, our total assets at \nquarter-end\n and \nyear-end\n dates are generally not materially different from those occurring within our reporting periods. \n \nIn order to ensure appropriate risk management, we seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid balance sheet and have processes in place to dynamically manage our assets and liabilities, which include (i)\u00a0balance sheet planning, (ii)\u00a0balance sheet limits, (iii)\u00a0monitoring of key metrics and (iv)\u00a0scenario analyses. \n \nBalance Sheet Planning.\n We prepare a balance sheet plan that combines our projected total assets and composition of assets with our expected funding sources over a three-year time horizon. This plan is reviewed quarterly and may be adjusted in response to changing business needs or market conditions. The objectives of this planning process are: \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nTo develop our balance sheet projections, taking into account the general state of the financial markets and expected business activity levels, as well as regulatory requirements; \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nTo allow Treasury and our independent risk oversight and control functions to objectively evaluate balance sheet limit requests from our revenue-producing units in the context of our overall balance sheet constraints, including our liability profile and capital levels, and key metrics; and \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nTo inform the target amount, tenor and type of funding to raise, based on our projected assets and contractual maturities. \n \n \n \n \n \nTreasury and our independent risk oversight and control functions, along with our revenue-producing units, review current and prior period information and expectations for the year to prepare our balance sheet plan. The specific information reviewed includes asset and liability size and composition, limit utilization, risk and performance measures, and capital usage. \n \n \n \nOur consolidated balance sheet plan, including our balance sheets by business, funding projections and projected key metrics, is reviewed and approved by the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee and the Risk Governance Committee. See \u201cRisk Management\u00a0\u2014 Overview and Structure of Risk Management\u201d for an overview of our risk management structure. \n \nBalance Sheet Limits.\n The Firmwide Asset Liability Committee and the Risk Governance Committee have the responsibility to review and approve balance sheet limits. These limits are set at levels which are close to actual operating levels, rather than at levels which reflect our maximum risk appetite, in order to ensure prompt escalation and discussion among our revenue-producing units, Treasury and our independent risk oversight and control functions on a routine basis. Requests for changes in limits are evaluated after giving consideration to their impact on our key metrics. Compliance with limits is monitored by our revenue-producing units and Treasury, as well as our independent risk oversight and control functions. \n \nMonitoring of Key Metrics.\n We monitor key balance sheet metrics both by business and on a consolidated basis, including asset and liability size and composition, limit utilization and risk measures. We attribute assets to businesses and review and analyze movements resulting from new business activity, as well as market fluctuations. \n \nScenario Analyses.\n We conduct various scenario analyses, including as part of CCAR and U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act Stress Tests (DFAST), as well as our resolution and recovery planning. See \u201cCapital Management and Regulatory Capital\u00a0\u2014 Capital Management\u201d for further information about these scenario analyses. These scenarios cover short- and long-term time horizons using various macroeconomic and firm-specific assumptions, based on a range of economic scenarios. We use these analyses to assist us in developing our longer-term balance sheet management strategy, including the level and composition of assets, funding and capital. Additionally, these analyses help us develop approaches for maintaining appropriate funding, liquidity and capital across a variety of situations, including a severely stressed environment. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n79\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

As of December\u00a02021, the increase in our repurchase agreements relative to the average daily amount of repurchase agreements during the quarter and year resulted from higher levels of our and our clients\u2019 activities at the end of the period. \n \nThe level of our repurchase agreements fluctuates between and within periods, primarily due to providing clients with access to highly liquid collateral, such as certain government and agency obligations, through collateralized financing activities. \n \nThe table below presents information about our balance sheet and leverage ratios. \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs of December\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n$ in\u00a0millions\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nTotal assets\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$1,463,988\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$1,163,028\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nUnsecured long-term borrowings\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n254,092\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n213,481\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nTotal shareholders\u2019 equity\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n109,926\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n95,932\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nLeverage ratio\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n13.3x\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n12.1x\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nDebt-to-equity\n ratio\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2.3x\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2.2x\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn the table above: \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nThe leverage ratio equals total assets divided by total shareholders\u2019 equity and measures the proportion of equity and debt we use to finance assets.

We generally distribute our funding products through our own sales force and third-party distributors to a large, diverse creditor base in a variety of markets in the Americas, Europe and Asia. We believe that our relationships with our creditors are critical to our liquidity. Our creditors include banks, governments, securities lenders, corporations, pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds and individuals. We have imposed various internal guidelines to monitor creditor concentration across our funding programs. \n \nDeposits.\n Our deposits provide us with a diversified source of funding and reduce our reliance on wholesale funding. We raise deposits, including savings, demand and time deposits, from private bank clients, consumers, transaction banking clients, other institutional clients, and through internal and third-party broker-dealers. Substantially all of our deposits are raised through GS Bank USA and GSIB. See Note\u00a013 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our deposits, including a maturity profile of our time deposits. \n \nSecured Funding.\n We fund a significant amount of inventory and a portion of investments on a secured basis. Secured funding includes collateralized financings in the consolidated balance sheets. See Note\u00a011 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our collateralized financings, including its maturity profile. We may also pledge our inventory and investments as collateral for securities borrowed under a securities lending agreement. We also use our own inventory and investments to cover transactions in which we or our clients have sold securities that have not yet been purchased. Secured funding is less sensitive to changes in our credit quality than unsecured funding, due to our posting of collateral to our lenders. Nonetheless, we analyze the refinancing risk of our secured funding activities, taking into account trade tenors, maturity profiles, counterparty concentrations, collateral eligibility and counterparty rollover probabilities. We seek to mitigate our refinancing risk by executing term trades with staggered maturities, diversifying counterparties, raising excess secured funding and \npre-funding\n residual risk through our GCLA. \n \n \n \nWe seek to raise secured funding with a term appropriate for the liquidity of the assets that are being financed, and we seek longer maturities for secured funding collateralized by asset classes that may be harder to fund on a secured basis, especially during times of market stress. Our secured funding, excluding funding collateralized by liquid government and agency obligations, is primarily executed for tenors of one month or greater and is primarily executed through term repurchase agreements and securities loaned contracts. \n \nAssets that may be harder to fund on a secured basis during times of market stress include certain financial instruments in the following categories: mortgage and other asset-backed loans and securities, \nnon-investment-grade\n corporate debt securities, equity securities and emerging market securities. \n \nWe also raise financing through other types of collateralized financings, such as secured loans and notes. GS Bank USA has access to funding from the Federal Home Loan Bank. Our outstanding borrowings against the Federal Home Loan Bank were $100\u00a0million as of December\u00a02021 and we had no outstanding borrowings as of December\u00a02020. Additionally, we have access to funding through the Federal Reserve discount window. However, we do not rely on this funding in our liquidity planning and stress testing. \n \nUnsecured Short-Term Borrowings.\n A significant portion of our unsecured short-term borrowings was originally long-term debt that is scheduled to mature within one year of the reporting date. We use unsecured short-term borrowings, including U.S. and \nnon-U.S.\n hybrid financial instruments and commercial paper, to finance liquid assets and for other cash management purposes. In accordance with regulatory requirements, Group Inc. does not issue debt with an original maturity of less than one year, other than to its subsidiaries.

To mitigate refinancing risk, we seek to limit the principal amount of debt maturing over the course of any monthly, quarterly or annual time horizon. We enter into interest rate swaps to convert a portion of our unsecured long-term borrowings into floating-rate obligations to manage our exposure to interest rates. See Note\u00a014 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our unsecured long-term borrowings. We issued approximately $60\u00a0billion of benchmark debt during 2021 to support the growth in our total assets amid client demand and attractive return opportunities. We intend to issue significantly less benchmark debt in 2022 compared to our benchmark debt issuance in 2021, though actual issuances may differ due to business needs and market opportunities. \n \nShareholders\u2019 Equity.\n Shareholders\u2019 equity is a stable and perpetual source of funding. See Note\u00a019 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our shareholders\u2019 equity. \n \nCapital\u00a0Management\u00a0and\u00a0Regulatory\u00a0Capital \n \nCapital adequacy is of critical importance to us. We have in place a comprehensive capital management policy that provides a framework, defines objectives and establishes guidelines to assist us in maintaining the appropriate level and composition of capital in both \nbusiness-as-usual\n and stressed conditions. \n \nCapital Management \n \nWe determine the appropriate amount and composition of our capital by considering multiple factors, including our current and future regulatory capital requirements, the results of our capital planning and stress testing process, the results of resolution capital models and other factors, such as rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment and conditions in the financial markets. \n \n \n \nWe manage our capital requirements and the levels of our capital usage principally by setting limits on the balance sheet and/or limits on risk, in each case at both the firmwide and business levels. \n \nWe principally manage the level and composition of our capital through issuances and repurchases of our common stock. \n \nWe may issue, redeem or repurchase our preferred stock, junior subordinated debt issued to trusts and other subordinated debt or other forms of capital as business conditions warrant. Prior to such redemptions or repurchases, we must receive approval from the FRB. See Notes\u00a014 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our preferred stock, junior subordinated debt issued to trusts and other subordinated debt. \n \nCapital Planning and Stress Testing Process.\n As part of capital planning, we project sources and uses of capital given a range of business environments, including stressed conditions. Our stress testing process is designed to identify and measure material risks associated with our business activities, including market risk, credit risk, operational risk and liquidity risk, as well as our ability to generate revenues. \n \nOur capital planning process incorporates an internal capital adequacy assessment with the objective of ensuring that we are appropriately capitalized relative to the risks in our businesses. We incorporate stress scenarios into our capital planning process with a goal of holding sufficient capital to ensure we remain adequately capitalized after experiencing a severe stress event. Our assessment of capital adequacy is viewed in tandem with our assessment of liquidity adequacy and is integrated into our overall risk management structure, governance and policy framework. \n \nOur stress tests incorporate our internally designed stress scenarios, including our internally developed severely adverse scenario, and those required by the FRB, and are designed to capture our specific vulnerabilities and risks. We provide further information about our stress test processes and a summary of the results on our website as described in \u201cBusiness\u00a0\u2014 Available Information\u201d in Part\u00a0I, Item 1 of this \nForm\u00a010-K.\n \n \nAs required by the FRB\u2019s CCAR rules, we submit an annual capital plan for review by the FRB. The purpose of the FRB\u2019s review is to ensure that we have a robust, forward-looking capital planning process that accounts for our unique risks and that permits continued operation during times of economic and financial stress. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n82\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nThe FRB evaluates us based, in part, on whether we have the capital necessary to continue operating under the baseline and severely adverse scenarios provided by the FRB and those developed internally. This evaluation also takes into account our process for identifying risk, our controls and governance for capital planning, and our guidelines for making capital planning decisions. In addition, the FRB evaluates our plan to make capital distributions (i.e., dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions of stock, subordinated debt or other capital securities) and issue capital, across the range of macroeconomic scenarios and firm-specific assumptions. The FRB determines the SCB applicable to us based on its own annual stress test. The SCB under the Standardized approach is calculated as (i)\u00a0the difference between our starting and minimum projected CET1 capital ratios under the supervisory severely adverse scenario and (ii)\u00a0our planned common stock dividends for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon, expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets (RWAs). \n \nWe submitted our 2021 CCAR capital plan in April\u00a02021 and published a summary of our annual DFAST results in June\u00a02021. See \u201cBusiness\u00a0\u2014 Available Information\u201d in Part\u00a0I, Item 1 of this \nForm\u00a010-K.\n Based on our 2021 CCAR submission, the FRB reduced our SCB from 6.6% to 6.4%, resulting in a Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement of 13.4% for the period from October\u00a01,\u00a02021 through September\u00a030,\u00a02022. See \u201cShare Repurchase Program\u201d for further information about common stock repurchases and dividends. \n \nGS Bank USA has its own capital planning process and, starting in 2022, will be required to submit its annual stress test results to the FRB. GSI, GSIB and Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE (GSBE) also have their own capital planning and stress testing processes, which incorporate internally designed stress tests developed in accordance with the guidelines of their respective regulators. \n \nContingency Capital Plan.\n As part of our comprehensive capital management policy, we maintain a contingency capital plan. Our contingency capital plan provides a framework for analyzing and responding to a perceived or actual capital deficiency, including, but not limited to, identification of drivers of a capital deficiency, as well as mitigants and potential actions. It outlines the appropriate communication procedures to follow during a crisis period, including internal dissemination of information, as well as timely communication with external stakeholders. \n \n \n \nCapital Attribution.\n We assess each of our businesses\u2019 capital usage based on our internal assessment of risks, which incorporates an attribution of our relevant regulatory capital requirements. These regulatory capital requirements are allocated using our attributed equity framework, which takes into consideration our most binding capital constraints. Our most binding capital constraint is based on the results of the FRB\u2019s annual stress test, which includes the Standardized risk-based capital and leverage ratios. \n \nWe review and make any necessary adjustments to our attributed equity in January each year, to reflect, among other things, the results of our latest CCAR process, as well as projected changes in our balance sheet. On January\u00a01,\u00a02021, our allocation of attributed equity changed (relative to the allocation as of December\u00a02020) as follows: attributed equity increased by approximately $3.7\u00a0billion for Asset Management and approximately $0.7\u00a0billion for Consumer\u00a0& Wealth Management, while attributed equity decreased by approximately $2.3\u00a0billion for Global Markets and approximately $2.1\u00a0billion for Investment Banking. On January\u00a01,\u00a02022, our allocation of attributed equity changed (relative to the allocation as of December\u00a02021) as follows: attributed equity increased by approximately $1.0\u00a0billion for Consumer\u00a0& Wealth Management and approximately $0.5\u00a0billion for Investment Banking, while attributed equity decreased by approximately $0.8\u00a0billion for Global Markets and approximately $0.7\u00a0billion for Asset Management. See \u201cSegment Assets and Operating Results\u00a0\u2014 Segment Operating Results\u201d for information about our average quarterly attributed equity by segment. \n \nShare Repurchase Program.\n We use our share repurchase program to help maintain the appropriate level of common equity. The repurchase program is effected primarily through regular open-market purchases (which may include repurchase plans designed to comply with \nRule\u00a010b5-1\n and accelerated share repurchases), the amounts and timing of which are determined primarily by our current and projected capital position and our capital plan submitted to the FRB as part of CCAR. The amounts and timing of the repurchases may also be influenced by general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of our common stock. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n83\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nIn the third quarter of 2021, the Board of Directors of Group Inc. (Board) approved an increase in our common stock dividend from $1.25 to $2.00 per share. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we returned a total of $1.20\u00a0billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $500\u00a0million and approximately $700\u00a0million in common stock dividends. We currently expect our common stock repurchases in the first quarter of 2022 to be at or around the levels of common stock repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2021. Consistent with our capital management philosophy, we will continue prioritizing deployment of capital for our clients where returns are attractive and return any excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. \n \nAs of December\u00a02021, the remaining share authorization under our existing repurchase program was 34.4\u00a0million shares. See \u201cMarket for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\u201d in Part\u00a0II, Item 5 of this \nForm\u00a010-K\n and Note\u00a019 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our share repurchase program, and see above for information about our capital planning and stress testing process. \n \nResolution Capital Models.\n In connection with our resolution planning efforts, we have established a Resolution Capital Adequacy and Positioning framework, which is designed to ensure that our major subsidiaries (GS Bank USA, Goldman Sachs\u00a0& Co. LLC (GS&Co.), GSI, GSIB, GSBE, Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL), Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. and Goldman Sachs Asset Management International) have access to sufficient loss-absorbing capacity (in the form of equity, subordinated debt and unsecured senior debt) so that they are able to wind-down following a Group Inc. bankruptcy filing in accordance with our preferred resolution strategy. \n \nIn addition, we have established a triggers and alerts framework, which is designed to provide the Board with information needed to make an informed decision on whether and when to commence bankruptcy proceedings for Group Inc. \n \nRating Agency Guidelines \n \nThe credit rating agencies assign credit ratings to the obligations of Group Inc., which directly issues or guarantees substantially all of our senior unsecured debt obligations. GS&Co. and GSI have been assigned long- and short-term issuer ratings by certain credit rating agencies. GS Bank USA, GSIB and GSBE have also been assigned long- and short-term issuer ratings, as well as ratings on their long- and short-term bank deposits. In addition, credit rating agencies have assigned ratings to debt obligations of certain other subsidiaries of Group Inc. \n \n \n \nThe level and composition of our capital are among the many factors considered in determining our credit ratings. Each agency has its own definition of eligible capital and methodology for evaluating capital adequacy, and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors rather than a single calculation. See \u201cRisk Management\u00a0\u2014 Liquidity Risk Management\u00a0\u2014 Credit Ratings\u201d for further information about credit ratings of Group Inc., GS Bank USA, GSIB, GSBE, GS&Co. and GSI. \n \nConsolidated Regulatory Capital \n \nWe are subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements which are calculated in accordance with the regulations of the FRB (Capital Framework). Under the Capital Framework, we are an \u201cAdvanced approach\u201d banking organization and have been designated as a global systemically important bank \n(G-SIB).\n \n \nThe capital requirements calculated under the Capital Framework include the capital conservation buffer requirements, which are comprised of a 2.5% buffer (under the Advanced Capital Rules), the SCB (under the Standardized Capital Rules), a countercyclical capital buffer (under both Capital Rules) and the \nG-SIB\n surcharge (under both Capital Rules). Our \nG-SIB\n surcharge is 2.5% for 2021 and 2022 and 3.0% for 2023. Based on financial data for 2021, we are above the threshold for the 3.5% \nG-SIB\n surcharge. The earliest this surcharge could be effective is January\u00a02024. The \nG-SIB\n surcharge and countercyclical capital buffer in the future may differ due to additional guidance from our regulators and/or positional changes, and our SCB is likely to change from year to year based on the results of the annual supervisory stress tests. Our target is to maintain capital ratios equal to the regulatory requirements plus a buffer of 50 to 100 basis points. \n \nSee Note\u00a020 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios, and the Capital Framework. \n \nTotal Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) \n \nWe are also subject to the FRB\u2019s TLAC and related requirements.

These entities are subject to regulatory capital requirements. See Note\u00a020 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the regulatory capital requirements of our bank subsidiaries. \n \nU.S. Regulated Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries.\n GS&Co. is our primary U.S. regulated broker-dealer subsidiary and is subject to regulatory capital requirements, including those imposed by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. In addition, GS&Co. is a registered futures commission merchant and a registered swap dealer with the CFTC, and therefore is subject to regulatory capital requirements imposed by the CFTC, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the National Futures Association. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, GS&Co. also became a registered security-based swap dealer with the SEC, and therefore became subject to capital requirements for security-based swap dealers which became effective in October\u00a02021. \nRule\u00a015c3-1\n of the SEC and Rules\u00a01.17 and Part\u00a023 Subpart E of the CFTC specify uniform minimum net capital requirements, as defined, for their registrants, and also effectively require that a significant part of the registrants\u2019 assets be kept in relatively liquid form. GS&Co. has elected to calculate its minimum capital requirements in accordance with the \u201cAlternative Net Capital Requirement\u201d as permitted by \nRule\u00a015c3-1\n of the SEC. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n85\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

In addition to its alternative minimum net capital requirements, GS&Co. is also required to hold tentative net capital in excess of $5\u00a0billion and net capital in excess of $1\u00a0billion in accordance with \nRule\u00a015c3-1.\n GS&Co. is also required to notify the SEC in the event that its tentative net capital is less than $6\u00a0billion. As of both December\u00a02021 and December\u00a02020, GS&Co. had tentative net capital and net capital in excess of both the minimum and the notification requirements. \n \nNon-U.S.\n Regulated Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries.\n Our principal \nnon-U.S.\n regulated broker-dealer subsidiaries include GSI and GSJCL. \n \nGSI, our U.K. broker-dealer, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).\n \nGSI is subject to the U.K. capital framework, which is predominantly aligned with the E.U. capital framework prescribed in the amended E.U.

The U.S. federal banking agencies\u2019 guidance strongly encourages banking organizations to cease using USD LIBOR. \n \nThe International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol (IBOR Protocol) has provided derivatives market participants with amended fallbacks for legacy and new derivative contracts to mitigate legal or economic uncertainty. Both counterparties have to adhere to the IBOR Protocol or engage in bilateral amendments for the terms to be effective for derivative contracts. ISDA confirmed that the FCA\u2019s formal announcement in March\u00a02021 fixed the spread adjustment for all LIBOR rates and that fallbacks will automatically occur for outstanding derivative contracts that incorporate the relevant terms. In April\u00a02021, the State of New York approved legislation intended to minimize legal and economic uncertainty for contracts that are governed by New York law and have no fallback provisions or have fallback provisions that are based on USD LIBOR by providing a statutory framework to replace USD LIBOR with a benchmark rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). \n \nWe have facilitated an orderly transition from \nnon-USD\n LIBORs to alternative risk-free reference rates for us and our clients and continue to make progress on our transition program as it relates to USD LIBOR. \n \n \n \nOur \nnon-USD\n LIBOR risk exposure was substantially all in connection with derivative contracts. As of December\u00a02021, substantially all of our \nnon-USD\n LIBOR-based derivative contracts were with central clearing counterparties or exchanges which had incorporated fallbacks consistent with the IBOR Protocol in their rulebooks or were under bilateral agreements subject to the IBOR Protocol. The remainder were converted to synthetic rates as permitted by the FCA. The notional amount of derivatives converted to synthetic rates was not material. \n \nOur risk exposure to USD LIBOR is primarily in connection with our derivative contracts and to a lesser extent our unsecured debt, preferred stock and loan portfolio. As of December\u00a02021, the notional amount of our USD LIBOR-based derivative contracts was approximately $10.0\u00a0trillion, of which approximately $5.5\u00a0trillion will mature after June\u00a02023 based on their contractual terms. A majority of such derivative contracts are with counterparties under bilateral agreements subject to the IBOR Protocol, or with central clearing counterparties or exchanges which have incorporated fallbacks consistent with the IBOR Protocol in their rulebooks and have announced that they plan to convert USD LIBOR contracts to alternative risk-free reference rates. Our benchmark unsecured debt and preferred stock with USD LIBOR exposure was approximately $34.5\u00a0billion as of December\u00a02021, of which $29.4\u00a0billion will contractually mature after June\u00a02023 or is perpetual and has no stated maturity date. A large portion of such debt and preferred stock represents our \nfixed-to-floating\n rate instruments, currently in the fixed-rate period, with call options before the LIBOR exposure begins. We continue to monitor industry and legislative developments as they relate to unsecured debt and preferred stock and will take actions designed to facilitate an orderly transition. In addition, we are also engaging with our clients in order to remediate our loan agreements through bilateral amendments. \n \nWe have also issued debt and deposits linked to SOFR and Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) and executed SOFR- and SONIA-based derivative contracts to make markets and facilitate client activities. When appropriate, we continue to execute transactions in the market to reduce our USD LIBOR exposures arising from hedges to our fixed-rate debt issuances and replace them with alternative risk-free reference rate exposures. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n87\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The surge of infections has led to a renewed emphasis globally on safety measures and restrictions, as well as a greater sense of urgency regarding the distribution of vaccines and vaccine boosters, and has created a greater degree of uncertainty regarding the prospects for economic growth in 2022. \n \n \n \nWe have continued to successfully execute on our BCP strategy since initially activating it in the first quarter of 2020 in response to the emergence of the \nCOVID-19\n pandemic. Our priority has been to safeguard our employees and to seek to ensure continuity of business operations on behalf of our clients. Our business continuity response to the \nCOVID-19\n pandemic is managed by a central team, which is led by our chief administrative officer and chief medical officer, and includes senior management within Risk and the chief operating officers across all regions and businesses. We remain focused on ensuring that our employees are able to safely work from our offices, where circumstances permit. During 2021, we made substantial progress in facilitating the safe return of employees to our offices and employees in a number of our locations around the world returned to the office to varying degrees. Given that the situation regarding \nCOVID-19\n is fluid and varies geographically, our approach to transitioning back to the office is flexible and evolves as the specific conditions and requirements of each location change. For instance, in light of the rapid spread of the Omicron variant late in 2021, we took the step of having the vast majority of employees in the U.S., the U.K. and in some of our other locations work remotely at the outset of 2022. \n \nOur systems and infrastructure have been robust throughout the \nCOVID-19\n pandemic, enabling us to conduct our activities without disruption. Communication throughout our organization has remained active during the pandemic and our risk management processes have continued to operate in a rigorous and disciplined manner.\n \nWe maintained high liquidity levels during 2021, as our GCLA averaged $335\u00a0billion for the year. We have continued to access our traditional funding sources in the normal course and service our debt and other obligations on a timely basis. See \u201cBalance Sheet and Funding Sources\u201d and \u201cRisk Management\u00a0\u2014 Liquidity Risk Management\u201d for further information. \n \nAccounting estimates, particularly those made in connection with determining the allowance for credit losses and the fair value of certain level\u00a03 assets, are sensitive to assumptions regarding future economic conditions. Predicting the trajectory of the economic recovery is highly judgmental given the uncertainty as to how the pandemic will evolve, as it will largely depend on the duration of the Omicron wave, the possible emergence of other variants and further progress in the distribution of vaccines and vaccine boosters. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n88\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nIn general, the market backdrop continued to be constructive during 2021 and activity levels remained solid. Volatility increased toward the end of the year as a result of the spike in infections, while accelerating inflation, driven by supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, and more moderated growth expectations, were key macroeconomic considerations heading into 2022. We continued to deploy our balance sheet to intermediate risk and to support the needs of clients. We have maintained our proactive approach to managing market risk levels, which entails ongoing review and monitoring of exposures and focusing on ways to mitigate risk. As the economic recovery progressed in 2021, credit risk continued to abate from the low point of the pandemic. However, we continue to closely monitor those industries that have been most severely challenged by the pandemic. \n \nWhile the global economy continued on the path to recovery during 2021, it is vulnerable to the risk that the Omicron variant, or other possible variants, could impede the recovery going forward by precipitating adverse economic consequences, such as a softening in consumer and business confidence and spending, a worsening of supply chain constraints, and an intensification of inflationary pressures. If the future effects of the pandemic were to lead to a sustained period of economic weakness, our businesses would be negatively impacted. This would have a negative impact on factors that are important to our operating performance, such as the level of client activity, creditworthiness of counterparties and borrowers, and the amount of our AUS. We will continue to closely monitor the rollout of vaccines across regions, as well as the impact of new variants of the virus, and will take further actions, as necessary, in order to best serve the interests of our employees, clients and counterparties.

Our involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms, including: \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nPurchasing or retaining residual and other interests in special purpose entities, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securitization vehicles; \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nHolding senior and subordinated debt, interests in limited and general partnerships, and preferred and common stock in other nonconsolidated vehicles; \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nEntering into interest rate, foreign currency, equity, commodity and credit derivatives, including total return swaps; and \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nProviding guarantees, indemnifications, commitments, letters of credit and representations and warranties. \n \n \n \n \n \nWe enter into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes, including securitizations. The securitization vehicles that purchase mortgages, corporate bonds and other types of financial assets are critical to the functioning of several significant investor markets, including the mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities markets, since they offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process. \n \nWe also enter into these arrangements to underwrite client securitization transactions; provide secondary market liquidity; make investments in performing and nonperforming debt, distressed loans, power-related assets, equity securities, real estate and other assets; and provide investors with credit-linked and asset-repackaged notes. \n \nThe table below presents where information about our various \noff-balance\n sheet arrangements may be found in this \nForm\u00a010-K.\n In addition, see Note\u00a03 to the consolidated financial statements for information about our consolidation policies. \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nOff-Balance\n Sheet Arrangement\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDisclosure in \nForm\u00a010-K\n \n\n\n\n\n \nVariable interests and other obligations, including contingent obligations, arising from variable interests in nonconsolidated variable interest entities (VIEs)\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nSee Note\u00a017 to the consolidated financial statements.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n \nGuarantees, and lending and other commitments\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nSee Note\u00a018 to the consolidated financial statements.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n \nDerivatives\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nSee \u201cRisk Management\u00a0\u2014 Credit Risk Management\u00a0\u2014 Credit Exposures\u00a0\u2014 OTC Derivatives\u201d and Notes\u00a04, 5, 7 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements.\n \n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n89\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nRisk Management \n \nRisks are inherent in our businesses and include liquidity, market, credit, operational, model, legal, compliance, conduct, regulatory and reputational risks. Our risks include the risks across our risk categories, regions or global businesses, as well as those which have uncertain outcomes and have the potential to materially impact our financial results, our liquidity and our reputation. For further information about our risk management processes, see \u201cOverview and Structure of Risk Management,\u201d and for information about our areas of risk, see \u201cLiquidity Risk Management,\u201d \u201cMarket Risk Management,\u201d \u201cCredit Risk Management,\u201d \u201cOperational Risk Management\u201d and \u201cModel Risk Management\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part\u00a0I, Item\u00a01A of this \nForm\u00a010-K.\n \n \nOverview and Structure of Risk Management \n \nOverview \n \nWe believe that effective risk management is critical to our success. Accordingly, we have established an enterprise risk management framework that employs a comprehensive, integrated approach to risk management, and is designed to enable comprehensive risk management processes through which we identify, assess, monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our activities. Our risk management structure is built around three core components: governance, processes and people. \n \nGovernance.\n Risk management governance starts with the Board, which both directly and through its committees, including its Risk Committee, oversees our risk management policies and practices implemented through the enterprise risk management framework. The Board is also responsible for the annual review and approval of our risk appetite statement. The risk appetite statement describes the levels and types of risk we are willing to accept or to avoid, in order to achieve our objectives included in our strategic business plan, while remaining in compliance with regulatory requirements. The Board reviews our strategic business plan and is ultimately responsible for overseeing and providing direction about our strategy and risk appetite. \n \n \n \nThe Board receives regular briefings on firmwide risks, including liquidity risk, market risk, credit risk, operational risk and model risk, from our independent risk oversight and control functions, including the chief risk officer, and on compliance risk and conduct risk from Compliance, on legal and regulatory enforcement matters from the chief legal officer, and on other matters impacting our reputation from the chair of our Firmwide Client and Business Standards Committee and our Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee. The chief risk officer reports to our chief executive officer and to the Risk Committee of the Board. As part of the review of the firmwide risk portfolio, the chief risk officer regularly advises the Risk Committee of the Board of relevant risk metrics and material exposures, including risk limits and thresholds established in our risk appetite statement. \n \nThe implementation of our risk governance structure and core risk management processes are overseen by Enterprise Risk, which reports to our chief risk officer, and is responsible for ensuring that our enterprise risk management framework provides the Board, our risk committees and senior management with a consistent and integrated approach to managing our various risks in a manner consistent with our risk appetite. \n \nOur revenue-producing units, as well as Treasury, Engineering, Human Capital Management, Operations, and Corporate and Workplace Solutions, are considered our first line of defense. They are accountable for the outcomes of our risk-generating activities, as well as for assessing and managing those risks within our risk appetite. \n \nOur independent risk oversight and control functions are considered our second line of defense and provide independent assessment, oversight and challenge of the risks taken by our first line of defense, as well as lead and participate in risk committees. Independent risk oversight and control functions include Compliance, Conflicts Resolution, Controllers, Legal, Risk and Tax. \n \nInternal Audit is considered our third line of defense, and our director of Internal Audit reports to the Audit Committee of the Board and administratively to our chief executive officer. Internal Audit includes professionals with a broad range of audit and industry experience, including risk management expertise. Internal Audit is responsible for independently assessing and validating the effectiveness of key controls, including those within the risk management framework, and providing timely reporting to the Audit Committee of the Board, senior management and regulators. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n90\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nThe three lines of defense structure promotes the accountability of first line risk takers, provides a framework for effective challenge by the second line and empowers independent review from the third line. \n \nProcesses.\n We maintain various processes that are critical components of our risk management framework, including (i)\u00a0risk identification and assessment, (ii)\u00a0risk appetite, limit and threshold setting, (iii)\u00a0risk reporting and monitoring, and (iv)\u00a0risk decision-making. \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nRisk Identification and Assessment.\n We believe that the identification and assessment of our risks is a critical step in providing our Board and senior management transparency and insight into the range and materiality of our risks. We have a comprehensive data collection process, including firmwide policies and procedures that require all employees to report and escalate risk events. Our approach for risk identification and assessment is comprehensive across all risk types, is dynamic and forward-looking to reflect and adapt to our changing risk profile and business environment, leverages subject matter expertise, and allows for prioritization of our most critical risks. \n \n \n \n \n \nTo effectively assess our risks, we maintain a daily discipline of marking substantially all of our inventory to current market levels. We carry our inventory at fair value, with changes in valuation reflected immediately in our risk management systems and in net revenues. We do so because we believe this discipline is one of the most effective tools for assessing and managing risk and that it provides transparent and realistic insight into our inventory exposures. \n \nAn important part of our risk management process is firmwide stress testing. It allows us to quantify our exposure to tail risks, highlight potential loss concentrations, undertake risk/reward analysis, and assess and mitigate our risk positions. Firmwide stress tests are performed on a regular basis and are designed to ensure a comprehensive analysis of our vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks combining financial and nonfinancial risks, including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity and funding, operational and compliance, strategic, systemic and emerging risks into a single combined scenario. We also perform ad hoc stress tests in anticipation of market events or conditions. Stress tests are also used to assess capital adequacy as part of our capital planning and stress testing process. See \u201cCapital Management and Regulatory Capital\u00a0\u2014 Capital Management\u201d for further information. \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nRisk Appetite, Limit and Threshold Setting.\n We apply a rigorous framework of limits and thresholds to control and monitor risk across transactions, products, businesses and markets. The Board, directly or indirectly through its Risk Committee, approves limits and thresholds included in our risk appetite statement at firmwide, business and product levels. In addition, the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee is responsible for approving our risk limits framework, subject to the overall limits approved by the Risk Committee of the Board, and monitoring these limits. \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Risk Governance Committee is responsible for approving limits at firmwide, business and product levels. Certain limits may be set at levels that will require periodic adjustment, rather than at levels that reflect our maximum risk appetite. This fosters an ongoing dialogue about risk among our first and second lines of defense, committees and senior management, as well as rapid escalation of \nrisk-related\n matters. Additionally, through delegated authority from the Risk Governance Committee, Market Risk sets limits at certain product and desk levels, and Credit Risk sets limits for individual counterparties, counterparties and their subsidiaries, industries and countries. Limits are reviewed regularly and amended on a permanent or temporary basis to reflect changing market conditions, business conditions or risk tolerance. \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nRisk Reporting and Monitoring.\n Effective risk reporting and risk decision-making depends on our ability to get the right information to the right people at the right time. As such, we focus on the rigor and effectiveness of our risk systems, with the objective of ensuring that our risk management technology systems provide us with complete, accurate and timely information. Our risk reporting and monitoring processes are designed to take into account information about both existing and emerging risks, thereby enabling our risk committees and senior management to perform their responsibilities with the appropriate level of insight into risk exposures. Furthermore, our limit and threshold breach processes provide means for timely escalation. We evaluate changes in our risk profile and our businesses, including changes in business mix or jurisdictions in which we operate, by monitoring risk factors at a firmwide level. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n91\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

We make extensive use of risk committees that meet regularly and serve as an important means to facilitate and foster ongoing discussions to manage and mitigate risks. \n \n \n \n \n \nWe maintain strong and proactive communication about risk and we have a culture of collaboration in decision-making among our first and second lines of defense, committees and senior management. While our first line of defense is responsible for management of their risk, we dedicate extensive resources to our second line of defense in order to ensure a strong oversight structure and an appropriate segregation of duties. We regularly reinforce our strong culture of escalation and accountability across all functions. \n \nPeople.\n Even the best technology serves only as a tool for helping to make informed decisions in real time about the risks we are taking. Ultimately, effective risk management requires our people to interpret our risk data on an ongoing and timely basis and adjust risk positions accordingly. The experience of our professionals, and their understanding of the nuances and limitations of each risk measure, guides us in assessing exposures and maintaining them within prudent levels.\n \n \n \nWe reinforce a culture of effective risk management, consistent with our risk appetite, in our training and development programs, as well as in the way we evaluate performance, and recognize and reward our people. Our training and development programs, including certain sessions led by our most senior leaders, are focused on the importance of risk management, client relationships and reputational excellence. As part of our performance review process, we assess reputational excellence, including how an employee exercises good risk management and reputational judgment, and adheres to our code of conduct and compliance policies. Our review and reward processes are designed to communicate and reinforce to our professionals the link between behavior and how people are recognized, the need to focus on our clients and our reputation, and the need to always act in accordance with our highest standards. \n \n \n \nStructure \n \nUltimate oversight of risk is the responsibility of our Board. The Board oversees risk both directly and through its committees, including its Risk Committee. We have a series of committees with specific risk management mandates that have oversight or decision-making responsibilities for risk management activities. Committee membership generally consists of senior managers from both our first and second lines of defense. We have established procedures for these committees to ensure that appropriate information barriers are in place. Our primary risk committees, most of which also have additional \nsub-committees,\n councils or working groups, are described below. In addition to these committees, we have other risk committees that provide oversight for different businesses, activities, products, regions and entities. All of our committees have responsibility for considering the impact on our reputation of the transactions and activities that they oversee. \n \nMembership of our risk committees is reviewed regularly and updated to reflect changes in the responsibilities of the committee members. Accordingly, the length of time that members serve on the respective committees varies as determined by the committee chairs and based on the responsibilities of the members. \n \nThe chart below presents an overview of our risk management governance structure. \n \n\u00a0\n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n \nManagement Committee.\n The Management Committee oversees our global activities. It provides this oversight directly and through authority delegated to committees it has established. This committee consists of our most senior leaders, and is chaired by our chief executive officer. Most members of the Management Committee are also members of other committees.

This committee is \nco-chaired\n by the controller and chief accounting officer, and our chief administrative officer, who are appointed as chairs by the chairs of the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee. \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nFirmwide Operational Risk and Resilience Committee.\n The Firmwide Operational Risk and Resilience Committee is responsible for overseeing operational risk, and for ensuring our business and operational resilience. To assist the Firmwide Operational Risk and Resilience Committee in carrying out its mandate, other risk committees with dedicated oversight for technology-related risks, including cyber security matters, report into the Firmwide Operational Risk and Resilience Committee. This committee is \nco-chaired\n by our chief administrative officer and the head of Operational Risk, who are appointed as chairs by the chairs of the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nFirmwide Conduct Committee.\n The Firmwide Conduct Committee is responsible for the ongoing approval and monitoring of the frameworks and policies which govern our conduct risks. Conduct risk is the risk that our people fail to act in a manner consistent with our Business Principles and related core values, policies or codes, or applicable laws or regulations, thereby falling short in fulfilling their responsibilities to us, our clients, colleagues, other market participants or the broader community. This committee is chaired by our chief legal officer, who is appointed as chair by the chairs of the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee. \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nRisk Governance Committee.\n The Risk Governance Committee (through delegated authority from the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee) is responsible for the ongoing approval and monitoring of risk frameworks, policies and parameters related to our core risk management processes, as well as limits, at firmwide, business and product levels. In addition, this committee reviews the results of stress tests and scenario analyses. To assist the Risk Governance Committee in carrying out its mandate, a number of other risk committees with dedicated oversight for stress testing, model risks and Volcker Rule compliance report into the Risk Governance Committee. This committee is chaired by our chief risk officer, who is appointed as chair by the chairs of the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee. \n \n \n \n \n \nFirmwide Client and Business Standards Committee.\n The Firmwide Client and Business Standards Committee is responsible for overseeing relationships with our clients, client service and experience, and related business standards, as well as client-related reputational matters. This committee is chaired by our president and chief operating officer, who is appointed as chair by the chief executive officer, and reports to the Management Committee.

This committee is chaired by our president and chief operating officer, who is appointed as chair by the chief executive officer, and the vice-chairs are our chief legal officer and the former chair of Conflicts Resolution (now a senior advisor to the firm), who are appointed as vice-chairs by the chair of the Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee. This committee periodically provides updates to, and receives guidance from, the Public Responsibilities Committee of the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nFirmwide Suitability Committee.\n The Firmwide Suitability Committee is responsible for setting standards and policies for product, transaction and client suitability and providing a forum for consistency across functions, regions and products on suitability assessments. This committee also reviews suitability matters escalated from other committees. This committee is \nco-chaired\n by our chief compliance officer, and a \nco-head\n of EMEA FICC sales, who are appointed as chairs by the chair of the Firmwide Client and Business Standards Committee. \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nFirmwide Investment Policy Committee.\n The Firmwide Investment Policy Committee periodically reviews our investing and lending activities on a portfolio basis, including review of risk management and controls, and sets business standards and policies for these types of investments. This committee is \nco-chaired\n by a \nco-head\n of our Asset Management Division, a \nco-head\n of our Global Markets Division and our chief risk officer, who are appointed as chairs by our president and chief operating officer and our chief financial officer. \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nFirmwide Capital Committee.\n The Firmwide Capital Committee provides approval and oversight of debt-related transactions, including principal commitments of our capital. This committee aims to ensure that business, reputational and suitability standards for underwritings and capital commitments are maintained on a global basis. This committee is \nco-chaired\n by the head of Credit Risk and the head of Americas Leveraged Finance, who are appointed as chairs by the chairs of the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nFirmwide Commitments Committee.\n The Firmwide Commitments Committee reviews our underwriting and distribution activities with respect to equity and equity-related product offerings, and sets and maintains policies and procedures designed to ensure that legal, reputational, regulatory and business standards are maintained on a global basis. In addition to reviewing specific transactions, this committee periodically conducts general strategic reviews of sectors and products and establishes policies in connection with transaction practices. This committee is \nco-chaired\n by the chief underwriting officer for EMEA, the chief equity underwriting officer for the Americas, a \nco-chairman\n of the Global Financial Institutions Group and a \nco-head\n of the Industrials Group in our Investment Banking Division, who are appointed as chairs by the chair of the Firmwide Client and Business Standards Committee. \n \n \n \n \n \nFirmwide Asset Liability Committee.\n The Firmwide Asset Liability Committee reviews and approves the strategic direction for our financial resources, including capital, liquidity, funding and balance sheet. This committee has oversight responsibility for asset liability management, including interest rate and currency risk, funds transfer pricing, capital allocation and incentives, and credit ratings. This committee makes recommendations as to any adjustments to asset liability management and financial resource allocation in light of current events, risks, exposures, and regulatory requirements and approves related policies. This committee is \nco-chaired\n by our chief financial officer and our global treasurer, who are appointed as chairs by our chief executive officer, and reports to the Management Committee. \n \nConflicts Management \n \nConflicts of interest and our approach to dealing with them are fundamental to our client relationships, our reputation and our long-term success. The term \u201cconflict of interest\u201d does not have a universally accepted meaning, and conflicts can arise in many forms within a business or between businesses. The responsibility for identifying potential conflicts, as well as complying with our policies and procedures, is shared by all of our employees. \n \nWe have a multilayered approach to resolving conflicts and addressing reputational risk. Our senior management oversees policies related to conflicts resolution and, in conjunction with Conflicts Resolution, Legal and Compliance, the Firmwide Client and Business Standards Committee, and other internal committees, formulates policies, standards and principles, and assists in making judgments regarding the appropriate resolution of particular conflicts. Resolving potential conflicts necessarily depends on the facts and circumstances of a particular situation and the application of experienced and informed judgment. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n94\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nAs a general matter, Conflicts Resolution reviews financing and advisory assignments in Investment Banking and certain of our investing, lending and other activities. In addition, we have various transaction oversight committees, such as the Firmwide Capital, Commitments and Suitability Committees and other committees that also review new underwritings, loans, investments and structured products. These groups and committees work with internal and external counsel and Compliance to evaluate and address any actual or potential conflicts. The head of Conflicts Resolution reports to our chief legal officer, who reports to our chief executive officer. \n \nWe regularly assess our policies and procedures that address conflicts of interest in an effort to conduct our business in accordance with the highest ethical standards and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. \n \nClimate Risk Management \n \nWe categorize climate risk into physical risk and transition risk. Physical risk is the risk that asset values may decline or operations may be disrupted as a result of changes in the climate, while transition risk is the risk that asset values may decline because of changes in climate policies or changes in the underlying economy due to decarbonization. \n \nAs a global financial institution, climate-related risks manifest in different ways across our businesses and we have continued to make significant enhancements to our climate risk management framework, including steps to further integrate climate into our broader risk management processes. We have integrated oversight of climate-related risks into our risk management governance structure, from senior management to our Board and its committees, including the Risk and Public Responsibilities Committees. The Risk Committee of the Board oversees firmwide financial and nonfinancial risks, which include climate risk, and, as part of its oversight, receives updates on our risk management approach to climate risk, including our approaches towards scenario analysis and integration into existing risk management processes. The Public Responsibilities Committee of the Board assists the Board in its oversight of our firmwide sustainability strategy and sustainability issues affecting us, including with respect to climate change. As part of its oversight, the Public Responsibilities Committee receives periodic updates on our sustainability strategy, and also periodically reviews our governance and related policies and processes for sustainability and climate change-related risks. Senior management within Risk is responsible for the development of our climate risk program. \n \n \n \nWe have begun incorporating climate risk into our credit evaluation and underwriting processes for select industries. Climate risk factors are now evaluated as part of transaction due diligence for select loan commitments. \n \nSee \u201cBusiness\u00a0\u2014 Sustainability\u201d in Part\u00a0I, Item\u00a01 and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part\u00a0I, Item\u00a01A of this \nForm\u00a010-K\n for information about our sustainability initiatives, including in relation to climate transition. \n \nCompliance Risk Management \n \nCompliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to our reputation arising from our failure to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and regulations, and our internal policies and procedures. Compliance risk is inherent in all activities through which we conduct our businesses. Our Compliance Risk Management Program, administered by Compliance, assesses our compliance, regulatory and reputational risk; monitors for compliance with new or amended laws, rules and regulations; designs and implements controls, policies, procedures and training; conducts independent testing; investigates, surveils and monitors for compliance risks and breaches; and leads our responses to regulatory examinations, audits and inquiries. We monitor and review business practices to assess whether they meet or exceed minimum regulatory and legal standards in all markets and jurisdictions in which we conduct business. \n \nCapital Risk Management \n \nCapital risk is the risk that our capital is insufficient to support our business activities under normal and stressed market conditions or we face capital reductions or RWA increases, including from new or revised rules or changes in interpretations of existing rules, and are therefore unable to meet our internal capital targets or external regulatory capital requirements. Capital adequacy is of critical importance to us. Accordingly, we have in place a comprehensive capital management policy that provides a framework, defines objectives and establishes guidelines to maintain an appropriate level and composition of capital in both \nbusiness-as-usual\n and stressed conditions. Our capital management framework is designed to provide us with the information needed to comprehensively manage risk, and develop and apply projected stress scenarios that capture idiosyncratic vulnerabilities with a goal of holding sufficient capital to remain adequately capitalized even after experiencing a severe stress event. See \u201cCapital Management and Regulatory Capital\u201d for further information about our capital management process. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n95\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nWe have established a comprehensive governance structure to manage and oversee our \nday-to-day\n capital management activities and compliance with capital rules and related policies. Our capital management activities are overseen by the Board and its committees. The Board is responsible for approving our annual capital plan and the Risk Committee of the Board approves our capital management policy. In addition, committees and members of senior management are responsible for the ongoing monitoring of our capital adequacy and evaluate current and future regulatory capital requirements, review the results of our capital planning and stress tests processes, and the results of our capital models, review our contingency capital plan, key capital adequacy metrics, including regulatory capital ratios, as well as capital plan metrics, such as the payout ratio, outcomes and findings of calculation testing, and monitor capital risk limits and breaches. \n \nOur process for managing capital risk also includes independent review functions in Risk that, among other things, assess regulatory capital policies and related interpretations, escalate certain interpretations to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, and perform calculation testing to corroborate alignment with applicable capital rules. \n \nLiquidity Risk Management \n \nOverview \n \nLiquidity risk is the risk that we will be unable to fund ourselves or meet our liquidity needs in the event of firm-specific, broader industry or market liquidity stress events. We have in place a comprehensive and conservative set of liquidity and funding policies. Our principal objective is to be able to fund ourselves and to enable our core businesses to continue to serve clients and generate revenues, even under adverse circumstances. \n \nTreasury, which reports to our chief financial officer, has primary responsibility for developing, managing and executing our liquidity and funding strategy within our risk appetite. \n \nLiquidity Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and Treasury, and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our liquidity risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses and the establishment of stress testing and limits frameworks. \n \n \n \nLiquidity Risk Management Principles \n \nWe manage liquidity risk according to three principles: (i)\u00a0hold sufficient excess liquidity in the form of GCLA to cover outflows during a stressed period, (ii)\u00a0maintain appropriate Asset-Liability Management and (iii)\u00a0maintain a viable Contingency Funding Plan. \n \nGCLA.\n GCLA is liquidity that we maintain to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows and collateral needs in a stressed environment. A primary liquidity principle is to \npre-fund\n our estimated potential cash and collateral needs during a liquidity crisis and hold this liquidity in the form of unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash. We believe that the securities held in our GCLA would be readily convertible to cash in a matter of days, through liquidation, by entering into repurchase agreements or from maturities of resale agreements, and that this cash would allow us to meet immediate obligations without needing to sell other assets or depend on additional funding from credit-sensitive markets. \n \nOur GCLA reflects the following principles: \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nThe first days or weeks of a liquidity crisis are the most critical to a company\u2019s survival; \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nFocus must be maintained on all potential cash and collateral outflows, not just disruptions to financing flows. Our businesses are diverse, and our liquidity needs are determined by many factors, including market movements, collateral requirements and client commitments, all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment; \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nDuring a liquidity crisis, credit-sensitive funding, including unsecured debt, certain deposits and some types of secured financing agreements, may be unavailable, and the terms (e.g., interest rates, collateral provisions and tenor) or availability of other types of secured financing may change and certain deposits may be withdrawn; and \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nAs a result of our policy to \npre-fund\n liquidity that we estimate may be needed in a crisis, we hold more unencumbered securities and have larger funding balances than our businesses would otherwise require. We believe that our liquidity is stronger with greater balances of highly liquid unencumbered securities, even though it increases our total assets and our funding costs. \n \n \n \n \n \nWe maintain our GCLA across Group Inc., Goldman Sachs Funding LLC (Funding IHC) and Group Inc.\u2019s major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries, asset types and clearing agents to provide us with sufficient operating liquidity to ensure timely settlement in all major markets, even in a difficult funding environment. In addition to the GCLA, we maintain cash balances and securities in several of our other entities, primarily for use in specific currencies, entities or jurisdictions where we do not have immediate access to parent company liquidity. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n96\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nAsset-Liability Management.\n Our liquidity risk management policies are designed to ensure we have a sufficient amount of financing, even when funding markets experience persistent stress. We manage the maturities and diversity of our funding across markets, products and counterparties, and seek to maintain a diversified funding profile with an appropriate tenor, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets. \n \nOur approach to asset-liability management includes: \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nConservatively managing the overall characteristics of our funding book, with a focus on maintaining long-term, diversified sources of funding in excess of our current requirements. See \u201cBalance Sheet and Funding Sources\u00a0\u2014 Funding Sources\u201d for further information; \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nActively managing and monitoring our asset base, with particular focus on the liquidity, holding period and ability to fund assets on a secured basis. We assess our funding requirements and our ability to liquidate assets in a stressed environment while appropriately managing risk. This enables us to determine the most appropriate funding products and tenors. See \u201cBalance Sheet and Funding Sources\u00a0\u2014 Balance Sheet Management\u201d for further information about our balance sheet management process and \u201c\u2014 Funding Sources\u00a0\u2014 Secured Funding\u201d for further information about asset classes that may be harder to fund on a secured basis; and \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nRaising secured and unsecured financing that has a long tenor relative to the liquidity profile of our assets. This reduces the risk that our liabilities will come due in advance of our ability to generate liquidity from the sale of our assets. Because we maintain a highly liquid balance sheet, the holding period of certain of our assets may be materially shorter than their contractual maturity dates. \n \n \n \n \n \nOur goal is to ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity to fund our assets and meet our contractual and contingent obligations in normal times, as well as during periods of market stress. Through our dynamic balance sheet management process, we use actual and projected asset balances to determine secured and unsecured funding requirements. Funding plans are reviewed and approved by the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee. In addition, our independent risk oversight and control functions analyze, and the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee reviews, our consolidated total capital position (unsecured long-term borrowings plus total shareholders\u2019 equity) so that we maintain a level of long-term funding that is sufficient to meet our long-term financing requirements. In a liquidity crisis, we would first use our GCLA in order to avoid reliance on asset sales (other than our GCLA). However, we recognize that orderly asset sales may be prudent or necessary in a severe or persistent liquidity crisis. \n \n \n \nSubsidiary Funding Policies \n \nThe majority of our unsecured funding is raised by Group Inc., which provides the necessary funds to Funding IHC and other subsidiaries, some of which are regulated, to meet their asset financing, liquidity and capital requirements. In addition, Group Inc. provides its regulated subsidiaries with the necessary capital to meet their regulatory requirements. The benefits of this approach to subsidiary funding are enhanced control and greater flexibility to meet the funding requirements of our subsidiaries. Funding is also raised at the subsidiary level through a variety of products, including deposits, secured funding and unsecured borrowings. \n \nOur intercompany funding policies assume that a subsidiary\u2019s funds or securities are not freely available to its parent, Funding IHC or other subsidiaries unless (i)\u00a0legally provided for and (ii)\u00a0there are no additional regulatory, tax or other restrictions. In particular, many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to Group Inc. or Funding IHC. Regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that Group Inc. needs to make payments on its obligations. Accordingly, we assume that the capital provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to Group Inc. or other subsidiaries and any other financing provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to Group Inc. or Funding IHC until the maturity of such financing. \n \nGroup Inc. has provided substantial amounts of equity and subordinated indebtedness, directly or indirectly, to its regulated subsidiaries. For example, as of December\u00a02021, Group Inc. had $38.08\u00a0billion of equity and subordinated indebtedness invested in GS&Co., its principal U.S. registered broker-dealer; $44.44\u00a0billion invested in GSI, a regulated U.K. broker-dealer; $2.50\u00a0billion invested in GSJCL, a regulated Japanese broker-dealer; $46.17\u00a0billion invested in GS Bank USA, a regulated New York State-chartered bank; and $4.28\u00a0billion invested in GSIB, a regulated U.K. bank. Group Inc. also provides financing, directly or indirectly, in the form of: $95.74\u00a0billion of unsubordinated loans (including secured loans of $41.91\u00a0billion) and $17.68\u00a0billion of collateral and cash deposits to these entities as of December\u00a02021. In addition, as of December\u00a02021, Group Inc. had significant amounts of capital invested in and loans to its other regulated subsidiaries. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n97\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nContingency Funding Plan.\n We maintain a contingency funding plan to provide a framework for analyzing and responding to a liquidity crisis situation or periods of market stress. Our contingency funding plan outlines a list of potential risk factors, key reports and metrics that are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assist in assessing the severity of, and managing through, a liquidity crisis and/or market dislocation. The contingency funding plan also describes in detail our potential responses if our assessments indicate that we have entered a liquidity crisis, which include \npre-funding\n for what we estimate will be our potential cash and collateral needs, as well as utilizing secondary sources of liquidity. Mitigants and action items to address specific risks which may arise are also described and assigned to individuals responsible for execution. \n \nThe contingency funding plan identifies key groups of individuals and their responsibilities, which include fostering effective coordination, control and distribution of information, implementing liquidity maintenance activities and managing internal and external communication, all of which are critical in the management of a crisis or period of market stress. \n \nStress Tests \n \nIn order to determine the appropriate size of our GCLA, we model liquidity outflows over a range of scenarios and time horizons. One of our primary internal liquidity risk models, referred to as the Modeled Liquidity Outflow, quantifies our liquidity risks over a \n30-day\n stress scenario. We also consider other factors, including, but not limited to, an assessment of our potential intraday liquidity needs through an additional internal liquidity risk model, referred to as the Intraday Liquidity Model, the results of our long-term stress testing models, our resolution liquidity models and other applicable regulatory requirements and a qualitative assessment of our condition, as well as the financial markets. The results of the Modeled Liquidity Outflow, the Intraday Liquidity Model, the long-term stress testing models and the resolution liquidity models are reported to senior management on a regular basis. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See \u201cOverview and Structure of Risk Management\u201d for information about firmwide stress tests. \n \nModeled Liquidity Outflow.\n Our Modeled Liquidity Outflow is based on conducting multiple scenarios that include combinations of market-wide and firm-specific stress. These scenarios are characterized by the following qualitative elements: \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nSeverely challenged market environments, which includes low consumer and corporate confidence, financial and political instability, and adverse changes in market values, including potential declines in equity markets and widening of credit spreads; and \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nA firm-specific crisis potentially triggered by material losses, reputational damage, litigation and/or a ratings downgrade. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following are key modeling elements of our Modeled Liquidity Outflow: \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nLiquidity needs over a \n30-day\n scenario; \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nA \ntwo-notch\n downgrade of our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings; \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nChanging conditions in funding markets, which limit our access to unsecured and secured funding; \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nNo support from additional government funding facilities. Although we have access to various central bank funding programs, we do not assume reliance on additional sources of funding in a liquidity crisis; and \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nA combination of contractual outflows and contingent outflows arising from both our \non-\n and \noff-balance\n sheet arrangements. Contractual outflows include, among other things, upcoming maturities of unsecured debt, term deposits and secured funding. Contingent outflows include, among other things, the withdrawal of customer credit balances in our prime brokerage business, increase in variation margin requirements due to adverse changes in the value of our exchange-traded and \nOTC-cleared\n derivatives, draws on unfunded commitments and withdrawals of deposits that have no contractual maturity. See notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about contractual outflows, including Note\u00a011 for collateralized financings, Note\u00a013 for deposits, Note\u00a014 for unsecured long-term borrowings and Note\u00a015 for operating lease payments, and \n\u201cOff-Balance\n Sheet Arrangements\u201d for further information about our various types of \noff-balance\n sheet arrangements. \n \n \n \n \n \nIntraday Liquidity Model.\n Our Intraday Liquidity Model measures our intraday liquidity needs using a scenario analysis characterized by the same qualitative elements as our Modeled Liquidity Outflow. The model assesses the risk of increased intraday liquidity requirements during a scenario where access to sources of intraday liquidity may become constrained. \n \nLong-Term Stress Testing.\n We utilize longer-term stress tests to take a forward view on our liquidity position through prolonged stress periods in which we experience a severe liquidity stress and recover in an environment that continues to be challenging. We are focused on ensuring conservative asset-liability management to prepare for a prolonged period of potential stress, seeking to maintain a diversified funding profile with an appropriate tenor, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n98\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nResolution Liquidity Models.\n In connection with our resolution planning efforts, we have established our Resolution Liquidity Adequacy and Positioning framework, which estimates liquidity needs of our major subsidiaries in a stressed environment. The liquidity needs are measured using our Modeled Liquidity Outflow assumptions and include certain additional inter-affiliate exposures. We have also established our Resolution Liquidity Execution Need framework, which measures the liquidity needs of our major subsidiaries to stabilize and wind-down following a Group Inc. bankruptcy filing in accordance with our preferred resolution strategy. \n \nIn addition, we have established a triggers and alerts framework, which is designed to provide the Board with information needed to make an informed decision on whether and when to commence bankruptcy proceedings for Group Inc. \n \nLimits \n \nWe use liquidity risk limits at various levels and across liquidity risk types to manage the size of our liquidity exposures. Limits are measured relative to acceptable levels of risk given our liquidity risk tolerance. See \u201cOverview and Structure of Risk Management\u201d for information about the limit approval process. \n \nLimits are monitored by Treasury and Liquidity Risk. Liquidity Risk is responsible for identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded. \n \nGCLA and Unencumbered Metrics \n \nGCLA.\n Based on the results of our internal liquidity risk models, described above, as well as our consideration of other factors, including, but not limited to, a qualitative assessment of our condition, as well as the financial markets, we believe our liquidity position as of both December\u00a02021 and December\u00a02020 was appropriate. We strictly limit our GCLA to a narrowly defined list of securities and cash because they are highly liquid, even in a difficult funding environment. We do not include other potential sources of excess liquidity in our GCLA, such as less liquid unencumbered securities or committed credit facilities. \n \n \n \nThe table below presents information

Our Modeled Liquidity Outflow and Intraday Liquidity Model incorporate a requirement for Group Inc., as well as a standalone requirement for each of our major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries. Funding IHC is required to provide the necessary liquidity to Group Inc. during the ordinary course of business, and is also obligated to provide capital and liquidity support to major subsidiaries in the event of our material financial distress or failure.

The LCR rule requires organizations to maintain an adequate ratio of eligible high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to expected net cash outflows under an acute, short-term liquidity stress scenario. Eligible HQLA excludes HQLA held by subsidiaries that is in excess of their minimum requirement and is subject to transfer restrictions. We are required to maintain a minimum LCR of 100%.

The net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected an increase in net deposits, reflecting increases across channels, and net issuances of unsecured long-term borrowings. The net cash used for investing activities primarily reflected purchases of investments and an increase in net lending activities, partially offset by sales and paydowns of investments. \n \nYear Ended December\u00a02020.\n Our cash and cash equivalents increased by $22.30\u00a0billion to $155.84\u00a0billion at the end of 2020, primarily due to net cash provided by financing activities, partially offset by net cash used for investing activities and operating activities. The net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected an increase in net deposits, reflecting increases in consumer, transaction banking and private bank deposits. The net cash used for investing activities primarily reflected an increase in net purchases of investments, reflecting an increase in U.S. government obligations accounted for as \navailable-for-sale\n and an increase in net lending activities. The net cash used for operating activities primarily reflected an increase in trading assets, net customer and other receivables and payables, and collateralized transactions (an increase in collateralized agreements, partially offset by an increase in collateralized financings), partially offset by an increase in trading liabilities as a result of our and our clients\u2019 activities. \n \nFor an analysis of cash flows for the year ended December\u00a02019, see Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a07 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Annual Report on \nForm\u00a010-K\n for the year ended December\u00a031,\u00a02020. \n \nMarket Risk Management \n \nOverview \n \nMarket risk is the risk of loss in the value of our inventory, investments, loans and other financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value due to changes in market conditions. We hold such positions primarily for market making for our clients and for our investing and financing activities, and therefore, these positions change based on client demands and our investment opportunities. Since these positions are accounted for at fair value, they fluctuate on a daily basis, with the related gains and losses included in the consolidated statements of earnings. We employ a variety of risk measures, each described in the respective sections below, to monitor market risk. Categories of market risk include the following: \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nInterest rate risk: results from exposures to changes in the level, slope and curvature of yield curves, the volatilities of interest rates, prepayment speeds and credit spreads; \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nEquity price risk: results from exposures to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities, baskets of equities and equity indices; \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nCurrency rate risk: results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of currency rates; and \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nCommodity price risk: results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of commodities, such as crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas, electricity, and precious and base metals. \n \n \n \n \n \nMarket Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our market risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses. \n \nManagers in revenue-producing units and Market Risk discuss market information, positions and estimated loss scenarios on an ongoing basis. Managers in revenue-producing units are accountable for managing risk within prescribed limits. These managers have \nin-depth\n knowledge of their positions, markets and the instruments available to hedge their exposures. \n \nMarket Risk Management Process \n \nOur process for managing market risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the \u201cOverview and Structure of Risk Management,\u201d as well as the following: \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nMonitoring compliance with established market risk limits and reporting our exposures; \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nDiversifying exposures; \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nControlling position sizes; and \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nEvaluating mitigants, such as economic hedges in related securities or derivatives. \n \n \n \n \n \nOur market risk management systems enable us to perform an independent calculation of \nValue-at-Risk\n (VaR) and stress measures, capture risk measures at individual position levels, attribute risk measures to individual risk factors of each position, report many different views of the risk measures (e.g., by desk, business, product type or entity) and produce ad hoc analyses in a timely manner. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n102\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis \n \n\u00a0\n \nRisk Measures \n \n \nWe produce risk measures and monitor them against established market risk limits. These measures reflect an extensive range of scenarios and the results are aggregated at product, business and firmwide levels. \n \nWe use a variety of risk measures to estimate the size of potential losses for both moderate and more extreme market moves over both short- and long-term time horizons. Our primary risk measures are VaR, which is used for shorter-term periods, and stress tests. Our risk reports detail key risks, drivers and changes for each desk and business, and are distributed daily to senior management of both our revenue-producing units and our independent risk oversight and control functions. \n \nValue-at-Risk.\n VaR is the potential loss in value due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level. For assets and liabilities included in VaR, see \u201cFinancial Statement Linkages to Market Risk Measures.\u201d We typically employ a \none-day\n time horizon with a 95% confidence level. We use a single VaR model, which captures risks, including interest rates, equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices. As such, VaR facilitates comparison across portfolios of different risk characteristics. VaR also captures the diversification of aggregated risk at the firmwide level. \n \nWe are aware of the inherent limitations to VaR and therefore use a variety of risk measures in our market risk management process. Inherent limitations to VaR include: \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nVaR does not estimate potential losses over longer time horizons where moves may be extreme; \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nVaR does not take account of the relative liquidity of different risk positions; and \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nPrevious moves in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of all future market moves. \n \n \n \n \n \nTo comprehensively capture our exposures and relevant risks in our VaR calculation, we use historical simulations with full valuation of market factors at the position level by simultaneously shocking the relevant market factors for that position. These market factors include spot prices, credit spreads, funding spreads, yield curves, volatility and correlation, and are updated periodically based on changes in the composition of positions, as well as variations in market conditions. We sample from five years of historical data to generate the scenarios for our VaR calculation. The historical data is weighted so that the relative importance of the data reduces over time. This gives greater importance to more recent observations and reflects current asset volatilities, which improves the accuracy of our estimates of potential loss. As a result, even if our positions included in VaR were unchanged, our VaR would increase with increasing market volatility and vice versa. \n \n \n \nGiven its reliance on historical data, VaR is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. \n \nOur VaR measure does not include: \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nPositions that are best measured and monitored using sensitivity measures; and \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nThe impact of changes in counterparty and our own credit spreads on derivatives, as well as changes in our own credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected. \n \n \n \n \n \nWe perform daily backtesting of our VaR model (i.e., comparing daily net revenues for positions included in VaR to the VaR measure calculated as of the prior business day) at the firmwide level and for each of our businesses and major regulated subsidiaries. \n \nStress Testing.\n Stress testing is a method of determining the effect of various hypothetical stress scenarios. We use stress testing to examine risks of specific portfolios, as well as the potential impact of our significant risk exposures. We use a variety of stress testing techniques to calculate the potential loss from a wide range of market moves on our portfolios, including firmwide stress tests, sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis. The results of our various stress tests are analyzed together for risk management purposes. See \u201cOverview and Structure of Risk Management\u201d for information about firmwide stress tests. \n \nSensitivity analysis is used to quantify the impact of a market move in a single risk factor across all positions (e.g., equity prices or credit spreads) using a variety of defined market shocks, ranging from those that could be expected over a \none-day\n time horizon up to those that could take many months to occur. We also use sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of the default of any single entity, which captures the risk of large or concentrated exposures. \n \nScenario analysis is used to quantify the impact of a specified event, including how the event impacts multiple risk factors simultaneously. For example, for sovereign stress testing we calculate potential direct exposure associated with our sovereign positions, as well as the corresponding debt, equity and currency exposures associated with our \nnon-sovereign\n positions that may be impacted by the sovereign distress. When conducting scenario analysis, we often consider a number of possible outcomes for each scenario, ranging from moderate to severely adverse market impacts. In addition, these stress tests are constructed using both historical events and forward-looking hypothetical scenarios. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n103\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nUnlike VaR measures, which have an implied probability because they are calculated at a specified confidence level, there may not be an implied probability that our stress testing scenarios will occur. Instead, stress testing is used to model both moderate and more extreme moves in underlying market factors. When estimating potential loss, we generally assume that our positions cannot be reduced or hedged (although experience demonstrates that we are generally able to do so). \n \nLimits \n \nWe use market risk limits at various levels to manage the size of our market exposures. These limits are set based on VaR and on a range of stress tests relevant to our exposures. See \u201cOverview and Structure of Risk Management\u201d for information about the limit approval process. \n \nMarket Risk is responsible for monitoring these limits, and identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded (e.g., due to positional changes or changes in market conditions, such as increased volatilities or changes in correlations). Such instances are remediated by a reduction in the positions we hold and/or a temporary or permanent increase to the limit, if warranted. \n \nMetrics \n \nWe analyze VaR at the firmwide level and a variety of more detailed levels, including by risk category, business and region. Diversification effect in the tables below represents the difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for the four risk categories.

However, there were temporary increases to the firmwide VaR risk limit as a result of the market environment in 2020. \n \nThe table below presents our high and low VaR. \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nYear Ended December\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n$ in\u00a0millions\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHigh\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLow\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHigh\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLow\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nCategories\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nInterest rates\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\u00a0\u00a074\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$49\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$120\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$46\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nEquity prices\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\u00a0\u00a071\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$30\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$116\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$23\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nCurrency rates\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\u00a0\u00a020\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\u00a0\u00a08\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\u00a0\u00a053\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\u00a0\u00a08\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nCommodity prices\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\u00a0\u00a045\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$14\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\u00a0\u00a054\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\u00a0\u00a09\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \nFirmwide\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nVaR\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$105\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$69\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$195\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$58\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \nThe chart below presents our daily VaR for 2021. \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n104\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

Net losses incurred on a single day for such positions exceeded our 95% \none-day\n VaR (i.e., a VaR exception) on one occasion during 2021 and on two occasions during 2020. \n \nDuring periods in which we have significantly more positive net revenue days than net revenue loss days, we expect to have fewer VaR exceptions because, under normal conditions, our business model generally produces positive net revenues. In periods in which our franchise revenues are adversely affected, we generally have more loss days, resulting in more VaR exceptions. The daily net revenues for positions included in VaR used to determine VaR exceptions reflect the impact of any intraday activity, including bid/offer net revenues, which are more likely than not to be positive by their nature. \n \nSensitivity Measures \n \nCertain portfolios and individual positions are not included in VaR because VaR is not the most appropriate risk measure.

The estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in credit spreads (counterparty and our own) and unsecured funding spreads on derivatives (including hedges) was a loss of $1\u00a0million as of December\u00a02021 and $3\u00a0million as of December\u00a02020. In addition, the estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in our own credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected was a gain of $33\u00a0million as of December\u00a02021 and $22\u00a0million as of December\u00a02020. However, the actual net impact of a change in our own credit spreads is also affected by the liquidity, duration and convexity (as the sensitivity is not linear to changes in yields) of those financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected, as well as the relative performance of any hedges undertaken. \n \nInterest Rate Sensitivity.\n Loans accounted for at amortized cost were $139.93\u00a0billion as of December\u00a02021 and $99.69\u00a0billion as of December\u00a02020, substantially all of which had floating interest rates. The estimated sensitivity to a 100\u00a0basis point increase in interest rates on such loans was $1.07\u00a0billion as of December\u00a02021 and $737\u00a0million as of December\u00a02020 of additional interest income over a twelve-month period, which does not take into account the potential impact of an increase in costs to fund such loans. See Note\u00a09 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about loans accounted for at amortized cost. \n \nOther Market Risk Considerations \n \nWe make investments in securities that are accounted for as \navailable-for-sale,\n \nheld-to-maturity\n or under the equity method which are included in investments in the consolidated balance sheets.

Our exposure to credit risk comes mostly from client transactions in OTC derivatives and loans and lending commitments. Credit risk also comes from cash placed with banks, securities financing transactions (i.e., resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending activities) and customer and other receivables. \n \n \n \nCredit Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our credit risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses. In addition, we hold other positions that give rise to credit risk (e.g., bonds and secondary bank loans). These credit risks are captured as a component of market risk measures, which are monitored and managed by Market Risk. We also enter into derivatives to manage market risk exposures. Such derivatives also give rise to credit risk, which is monitored and managed by Credit Risk. \n \nCredit Risk Management Process \n \nOur process for managing credit risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the \u201cOverview and Structure of Risk Management,\u201d as well as the following: \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nMonitoring compliance with established credit risk limits and reporting our credit exposures and credit concentrations; \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nEstablishing or approving underwriting standards; \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nAssessing the likelihood that a counterparty will default on its payment obligations; \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nMeasuring our current and potential credit exposure and losses resulting from a counterparty default; \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nUsing credit risk mitigants, including collateral and hedging; and \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nMaximizing recovery through active workout and restructuring of claims. \n \n \n \n \n \nWe also perform credit reviews, which include initial and ongoing analyses of our counterparties. For substantially all of our credit exposures, the core of our process is an annual counterparty credit review. A credit review is an independent analysis of the capacity and willingness of a counterparty to meet its financial obligations, resulting in an internal credit rating. The determination of internal credit ratings also incorporates assumptions with respect to the nature of and outlook for the counterparty\u2019s industry, and the economic environment. Senior personnel, with expertise in specific industries, inspect and approve credit reviews and internal credit ratings. \n \nOur risk assessment process may also include, where applicable, reviewing certain key metrics, including, but not limited to, delinquency status, collateral values, FICO credit scores and other risk factors. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n106\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nOur credit risk management systems capture credit exposure to individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis to counterparties and their subsidiaries. These systems also provide management with comprehensive information about our aggregate credit risk by product, internal credit rating, industry, country and region. \n \nRisk Measures \n \nWe measure our credit risk based on the potential loss in the event of \nnon-payment\n by a counterparty using current and potential exposure. For derivatives and securities financing transactions, current exposure represents the amount presently owed to us after taking into account applicable netting and collateral arrangements, while potential exposure represents our estimate of the future exposure that could arise over the life of a transaction based on market movements within a specified confidence level. Potential exposure also takes into account netting and collateral arrangements. For loans and lending commitments, the primary measure is a function of the notional amount of the position. \n \nStress Tests \n \nWe conduct regular stress tests to calculate the credit exposures, including potential concentrations that would result from applying shocks to counterparty credit ratings or credit risk factors (e.g., currency rates, interest rates, equity prices). These shocks cover a wide range of moderate and more extreme market movements, including shocks to multiple risk factors, consistent with the occurrence of a severe market or economic event. In the case of sovereign default, we estimate the direct impact of the default on our sovereign credit exposures, changes to our credit exposures arising from potential market moves in response to the default, and the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties that may result from the sovereign default. Unlike potential exposure, which is calculated within a specified confidence level, stress testing does not generally assume a probability of these events occurring. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See \u201cOverview and Structure of Risk Management\u201d for information about firmwide stress tests. \n \nTo supplement these regular stress tests, as described above, we also conduct tailored stress tests on an ad hoc basis in response to specific market events that we deem significant. We also utilize these stress tests to estimate the indirect impact of certain hypothetical events on our country exposures, such as the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties along with the shocks to the risk factors described above. The parameters of these shocks vary based on the scenario reflected in each stress test. We review estimated losses produced by the stress tests in order to understand their magnitude, highlight potential loss concentrations, and assess and mitigate our exposures where necessary. \n \n \n \nLimits \n \nWe use credit risk limits at various levels, as well as underwriting standards to manage the size and nature of our credit exposures. Limits for industries and countries are based on our risk appetite and are designed to allow for regular monitoring, review, escalation and management of credit risk concentrations. See \u201cOverview and Structure of Risk Management\u201d for information about the limit approval process. \n \nCredit Risk is responsible for monitoring these limits, and identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded. \n \nRisk Mitigants \n \nTo reduce our credit exposures on derivatives and securities financing transactions, we may enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. We may also reduce credit risk with counterparties by entering into agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from them on an upfront or contingent basis and/or to terminate transactions if the counterparty\u2019s credit rating falls below a specified level. We monitor the fair value of the collateral to ensure that our credit exposures are appropriately collateralized. We seek to minimize exposures where there is a significant positive correlation between the creditworthiness of our counterparties and the market value of collateral we receive. \n \nFor loans and lending commitments, depending on the credit quality of the borrower and other characteristics of the transaction, we employ a variety of potential risk mitigants. Risk mitigants include collateral provisions, guarantees, covenants, structural seniority of the bank loan claims and, for certain lending commitments, provisions in the legal documentation that allow us to adjust loan amounts, pricing, structure and other terms as market conditions change. The type and structure of risk mitigants employed can significantly influence the degree of credit risk involved in a loan or lending commitment. \n \nWhen we do not have sufficient visibility into a counterparty\u2019s financial strength or when we believe a counterparty requires support from its parent, we may obtain third-party guarantees of the counterparty\u2019s obligations. We may also mitigate our credit risk using credit derivatives or participation agreements. \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n107\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The percentage of our credit exposures arising from \nnon-investment-grade\n counterparties (based on our internally determined public rating agency equivalents) decreased as compared with December\u00a02020, primarily reflecting an increase in investment-grade credit exposure related to cash deposits with central banks. Our credit exposures are described further below. \n \nCash and Cash Equivalents.\n Our credit exposure on cash and cash equivalents arises from our unrestricted cash, and includes both interest-bearing and \nnon-interest-bearing\n deposits. To mitigate the risk of credit loss, we place substantially all of our deposits with highly rated banks and central banks. \n \nThe table below presents our credit exposure from unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and the concentration by industry, region and internally determined public rating agency equivalents. \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs of December\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n$ in\u00a0millions\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nCash and Cash Equivalents\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$236,168\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$131,324\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \nIndustry\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nFinancial Institutions\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n11%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nSovereign\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n95%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n89%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nTotal\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n100%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n100%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \nRegion\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nAmericas\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n55%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n45%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nEMEA\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n36%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n41%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nAsia\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n9%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n14%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nTotal\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n100%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n100%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \nCredit Quality (Credit Rating Equivalent)\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nAAA\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n64%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n44%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nAA\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n24%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n38%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nA\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n11%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n17%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nBBB\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nTotal\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n100%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n100%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \nThe table above excludes cash segregated for regulatory and other purposes of $24.87\u00a0billion as of December\u00a02021 and $24.52\u00a0billion as of December\u00a02020. \n \nOTC Derivatives.\n Our credit exposure on OTC derivatives arises primarily from our market-making activities. As a market maker, we enter into derivative transactions to provide liquidity to clients and to facilitate the transfer and hedging of their risks. We also enter into derivatives to manage market risk exposures. We manage our credit exposure on OTC derivatives using the credit risk process, measures, limits and risk mitigants described above. \n \n \n \nWe generally enter into OTC derivatives transactions under bilateral collateral arrangements that require the daily exchange of collateral. As credit risk is an essential component of fair value, we include a credit valuation adjustment (CVA) in the fair value of derivatives to reflect counterparty credit risk, as described in Note\u00a07 to the consolidated financial statements. CVA is a function of the present value of expected exposure, the probability of counterparty default and the assumed recovery upon default. \n \nThe table below presents our net credit exposure from OTC derivatives and the concentration by industry and region. \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs of December\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n$ in\u00a0millions\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nOTC derivative assets\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\u00a058,637\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\u00a064,850\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nCollateral (not netted under U.S. GAAP)\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(17,245\n\n\n)\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(18,990\n\n\n)\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nNet credit exposure\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\u00a041,392\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\u00a045,860\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \nIndustry\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nConsumer\u00a0& Retail\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nDiversified Industrials\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n10%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n23%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nFinancial Institutions\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n15%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n12%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nFunds\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n13%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n12%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nHealthcare\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nMunicipalities\u00a0& Nonprofit\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n6%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nNatural Resources\u00a0& Utilities\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n33%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n11%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nSovereign\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n8%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n14%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nTechnology, Media\u00a0& Telecommunications\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n8%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n12%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nOther (including Special Purpose Vehicles)\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nTotal\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n100%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n100%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \nRegion\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nAmericas\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n53%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n62%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nEMEA\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n37%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n30%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nAsia\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n10%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n8%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nTotal\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n100%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n100%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \nOur credit exposure (before any potential recoveries) to OTC derivative counterparties that defaulted during 2021 remained low, representing less than 2% of our total credit exposure from OTC derivatives. \n \nIn the table above: \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nOTC derivative assets, included in the consolidated balance sheets, are reported on a \nnet-by-counterparty\n basis (i.e., the net receivable for a given counterparty) when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement (counterparty netting) and are accounted for at fair value, net of cash collateral received under enforceable credit support agreements (cash collateral netting). \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nCollateral represents cash collateral and the fair value of securities collateral, primarily U.S. and \nnon-U.S.\n government and agency obligations, received under credit support agreements, that we consider when determining credit risk, but such collateral is not eligible for netting under U.S. GAAP. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n108\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

These receivables generally have minimal credit risk due to the low probability of clearing organization default and the short-term nature of receivables related to securities settlements. Receivables from customers and counterparties generally consist of collateralized receivables related to customer securities transactions and generally have minimal credit risk due to both the value of the collateral received and the short-term nature of these receivables. \n \nThe table below presents our other credit exposures and the concentration by industry, region and internally determined public rating agency equivalents. \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs of December\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n$ in\u00a0millions\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nOther Credit Exposures\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$61,187\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$56,429\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \nIndustry\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nFinancial Institutions\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n86%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n85%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nFunds\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n9%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n9%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nOther (including Special Purpose Vehicles)\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n6%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nTotal\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n100%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n100%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \nRegion\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nAmericas\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n50%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n54%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nEMEA\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n43%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n35%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nAsia\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n7%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n11%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nTotal\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n100%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n100%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n \nCredit Quality (Credit Rating Equivalent)\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nAAA\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nAA\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n47%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n48%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nA\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n29%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n27%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nBBB\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n6%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n8%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nBB or lower\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n13%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n11%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nUnrated\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\n \nTotal\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n100%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n100%\n\n\n\u00a0\n \n \n \n \nThe table above reflects collateral that we consider when determining credit risk. \n \nSelected Exposures \n \nWe have credit and market exposures, as described below, that have had heightened focus given recent events and broad market concerns.

We determine the country of risk by the location of the counterparty, issuer or underlier\u2019s assets, where they generate revenue, the country in which they are headquartered, the jurisdiction where a claim against them could be enforced, and/or the government whose policies affect their ability to repay their obligations. We monitor our credit exposure to a specific country both at the individual counterparty level, as well as at the aggregate country level. See \u201cStress Tests\u201d for information about stress tests that are designed to estimate the direct and indirect impact of events involving the above countries. \n \nOperational Risk Management \n \nOverview \n \nOperational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or from external events. Our exposure to operational risk arises from routine processing errors, as well as extraordinary incidents, such as major systems failures or legal and regulatory matters. \n \nPotential types of loss events related to internal and external operational risk include: \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nExecution, delivery and process management; \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nBusiness disruption and system failures; \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nEmployment practices and workplace safety; \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nClients, products and business practices; \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nDamage to physical assets; \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nInternal fraud; and \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nExternal fraud. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n114\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable of Contents\n \n \n \n \nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES \n \nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis \n \n\u00a0\n \n \nOperational Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for developing and implementing a formalized framework for assessing, monitoring and managing operational risk with the goal of maintaining our exposure to operational risk at levels that are within our risk appetite. \n \nOperational Risk Management Process \n \nOur process for managing operational risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the \u201cOverview and Structure of Risk Management,\u201d including a comprehensive data collection process, as well as firmwide policies and procedures, for operational risk events. \n \nWe combine \ntop-down\n and \nbottom-up\n approaches to manage and measure operational risk. From a \ntop-down\n perspective, our senior management assesses firmwide and business-level operational risk profiles. From a \nbottom-up\n perspective, our first and second lines of defense are responsible for risk identification and risk management on a \nday-to-day\n basis, including escalating operational risks and risk events to senior management. \n \nWe maintain a comprehensive control framework designed to provide a well-controlled environment to minimize operational risks. The Firmwide Operational Risk and Resilience Committee is responsible for overseeing operational risk, and for ensuring our business and operational resilience. \n \nOur operational risk management framework is designed to comply with the operational risk measurement rules under the Capital Framework and has evolved based on the changing needs of our businesses and regulatory guidance. \n \nWe have established policies that require all employees to report and escalate operational risk events. When operational risk events are identified, our policies require that the events be documented and analyzed to determine whether changes are required in our systems and/or processes to further mitigate the risk of future events. \n \nWe use operational risk management applications to capture, analyze, aggregate and report operational risk event data and key metrics. One of our key risk identification and assessment tools is an operational risk and control self-assessment process, which is performed by our managers. This process consists of the identification and rating of operational risks, on a forward-looking basis, and the related controls. The results from this process are analyzed to evaluate operational risk exposures and identify businesses, activities or products with heightened levels of operational risk. \n \n \n \nRisk Measurement \n \nWe measure our operational risk exposure using both statistical modeling and scenario analyses, which involve qualitative and quantitative assessments of internal and external operational risk event data and internal control factors for each of our businesses. Operational risk measurement also incorporates an assessment of business environment factors, including: \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nEvaluations of the complexity of our business activities; \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nThe degree of automation in our processes; \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nNew activity information; \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nThe legal and regulatory environment; and \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nChanges in the markets for our products and services, including the diversity and sophistication of our customers and counterparties. \n \n \n \n \n \nThe results from these scenario analyses are used to monitor changes in operational risk and to determine business lines that may have heightened exposure to operational risk. These analyses are used in the determination of the appropriate level of operational risk capital to hold. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See \u201cOverview and Structure of Risk Management\u201d for information about firmwide stress tests. \n \nTypes of Operational Risks \n \nIncreased reliance on technology and third-party relationships has resulted in increased operational risks, such as information and cyber security risk, third-party risk and business resilience risk. We manage those risks as follows: \n \nInformation and Cyber Security Risk.\n Information and cyber security risk is the risk of compromising the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our data and systems, leading to an adverse impact to us, our reputation, our clients and/or the broader financial system. We seek to minimize the occurrence and impact of unauthorized access, disruption or use of information and/or information systems. We deploy and operate preventive and detective controls and processes to mitigate emerging and evolving information security and cyber security threats, including monitoring our network for known vulnerabilities and signs of unauthorized attempts to access our data and systems. There is increased information risk through diversification of our data across external service providers, including use of a variety of cloud-provided or -hosted services and applications.

AND SUBSIDIARIES \nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis \n\u00a0\nThird-Party Risk.\n Third-party risk, including vendor risk, is the risk of an adverse impact due to reliance on third parties performing services or activities on our behalf. These risks may include legal, regulatory, information security, reputational, operational or any other risks inherent in engaging a third party. We identify, manage and report key third-party risks and conduct due diligence across multiple risk domains, including information security and cyber security, resilience and additional third-party dependencies. The Third-Party Risk Program monitors, reviews and reassesses third-party risks on an ongoing basis. See \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part\u00a0I, Item\u00a01A of this \nForm\u00a010-K\n for further information about third-party risk. \nBusiness Resilience Risk.\n Business resilience risk is the risk of disruption to our critical processes. We monitor threats and assess risks and seek to ensure our state of readiness in the event of a significant operational disruption to the normal operations of our critical functions or their dependencies, such as critical facilities, systems, third parties, data and/or personnel. We approach BCP through the lens of business and operational resilience. The resilience framework defines the fundamental principles for BCP and crisis management to ensure that critical functions can continue to operate in the event of a disruption. The business continuity program is comprehensive, consistent firmwide and \nup-to-date,\n incorporating new information, techniques and technologies as and when they become available, and our resilience recovery plans incorporate and test specific and measurable recovery time objectives in accordance with local market best practices and regulatory requirements, and under specific scenarios.

We rely on quantitative models across our business activities primarily to value certain financial assets and liabilities, to monitor and manage our risk, and to measure and monitor our regulatory capital. \nModel Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units, model developers, model owners and model users, and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our model risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses, and provides periodic updates to senior management, risk committees and the Risk Committee of the Board. \nOur model risk management framework is managed through a governance structure and risk management controls, which encompass standards designed to ensure we maintain a comprehensive model inventory, including risk assessment and classification, sound model development practices, independent review and model-specific usage controls. The Firmwide Model Risk Control Committee oversees our model risk management framework. \nModel Review and Validation Process \nModel Risk consists of quantitative professionals who perform an independent review, validation and approval of our models. This review includes an analysis of the model documentation, independent testing, an assessment of the appropriateness of the methodology used, and verification of compliance with model development and implementation standards. \nWe regularly refine and enhance our models to reflect changes in market or economic conditions and our business mix. All models are reviewed on an annual basis, and new models or significant changes to existing models and their assumptions are approved prior to implementation. \nThe model validation process incorporates a review of models and trade and risk parameters across a broad range of scenarios (including extreme conditions) in order to critically evaluate and verify: \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe model\u2019s conceptual soundness, including the reasonableness of model assumptions, and suitability for intended use; \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe testing strategy utilized by the model developers to ensure that the models function as intended; \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe suitability of the calculation techniques incorporated in the model; \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe model\u2019s accuracy in reflecting the characteristics of the related product and its significant risks; \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe model\u2019s consistency with models for similar products; and \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe model\u2019s sensitivity to input parameters and assumptions. \nSee \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u00a0\u2014 Fair Value\u00a0\u2014 Review of Valuation Models,\u201d \u201cLiquidity Risk Management,\u201d \u201cMarket Risk Management,\u201d \u201cCredit Risk Management\u201d and \u201cOperational Risk Management\u201d for further information about our use of models within these areas. \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n116\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman\u00a0Sachs\u00a02021\u00a0Form 10-K\nTable of Contents\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.
