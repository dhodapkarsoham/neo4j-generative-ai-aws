{"item1": ">Item 1.\n \nBusiness\nCOVID-19 Pandemic and Inflation\nRecent global events, including the COVID-19 pandemic (\"COVID-19\"), have adversely affected global economies, disrupted global supply chains and labor force participation and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. \nWe experienced significant and variable disruptions to our business as federal, state and local restrictions were mandated, among other remedial measures, to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus. During fiscal 2021, most of our restaurants operated with no restrictions on indoor dining, although there was a significant reduction in guest traffic at our restaurants due to changes in consumer behavior as public health officials encouraged social distancing. While restrictions on the type of permitted operating model and occupancy capacity may continue to change, during fiscal 2022 all of our restaurants operated with no restrictions.\nDuring fiscal 2022, in addition to the associated impact of COVID-19, our operating results have been impacted by geopolitical and other macroeconomic factors, leading to increased commodity and wage inflation and other increased costs.  The ongoing effects of COVID-19 and its variants, along with other geopolitical and macroeconomic events, could lead to further government mandates, including but not limited to capacity restrictions, shifts in consumer behavior, wage inflation, staffing challenges, product and services cost inflation and disruptions in our supply chain.  If these factors significantly impact our cash flow in the future, we may again implement mitigation actions such as suspending dividends, increasing borrowings or modifying our operating strategies. Some of these measures may have an adverse impact on our business, including possible impairments of assets.\nOverview\nWe are a New York corporation formed in 1983. As of the fiscal year ended October\u00a01, 2022, we owned and/or operated 17 restaurants and bars, 16 fast food concepts and catering operations through our subsidiaries. Four of our restaurant and bar facilities are located in New York City, one is located in Washington, D.C., five are located in Las Vegas, Nevada, one is located in Atlantic City, New Jersey, four are located on the east coast of Florida and two are located on the gulf coast of Alabama.\nOur restaurants are typically larger, destination properties intended to benefit from high patron traffic attributable to the uniqueness of the location and catered events.  All of our expansion in recent years has been through acquisitions as follows:  \nThe Rustic Inn\n in Dania Beach, Florida (2014); \nShuckers\n in Jensen Beach, Florida (2016); two \nOriginal Oyster Houses\n, one in Gulf Shores, Alabama and one in Spanish Fort, Alabama (2017), \nJB's on the Beach \nin Deerfield Beach, Florida (2019), and \nBlue Moon Fish Company\n (2021) in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, Florida.\nThe names and themes of each of our restaurants are different except for our two \nBroadway Burger Bar and Grill\n restaurants and two \nOriginal Oyster House\n restaurants. The menus in our restaurants are extensive, offering a wide variety of high-quality foods at generally moderate prices. The atmosphere at many of the restaurants is lively and extremely casual. Most of the restaurants have separate bar areas, are open seven days a week and most serve lunch as well as dinner. A majority of our net sales are derived from dinner as opposed to lunch service.\nWhile decor differs from restaurant to restaurant, interiors are marked by distinctive architectural and design elements which often incorporate dramatic interior open spaces and extensive glass exteriors. The wall treatments, lighting and decorations are typically vivid, unusual and, in some cases, highly theatrical.\n5\nThe following table sets forth the restaurant properties we lease, own and operate as of October\u00a01, 2022:\nName\nLocation\nYear\nOpened(1)\nRestaurant Size\n(Square Feet)\nSeating\nCapacity(2)\nIndoor-\n(Outdoor)\nLease\nExpiration(3)\nSequoia\nWashington Harbour\nWashington, D.C.\n1990\n26,000\u00a0\n600\u00a0\n(400)\n2035\nBryant Park Grill\u00a0& Caf\u00e9\nBryant Park\nNew York, New York\n1995\n25,000\u00a0\n180\u00a0\n(820)\n2025\nAmerica\nNew York-New York\nHotel and Casino\nLas Vegas, Nevada\n1997\n20,000\u00a0\n450\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2034\nGallagher\u2019s Steakhouse\nNew York-New York\nHotel and Casino\nLas Vegas, Nevada\n1997\n5,500\u00a0\n260\u00a0\n2033\nGonzalez y Gonzalez\nNew York-New York\nHotel and Casino\nLas Vegas, Nevada\n1997\n2,000\u00a0\n120\u00a0\n2034\nBroadway Burger Bar and Grill\nNew York-New York\nHotel and Casino\nLas Vegas, Nevada\n2007\n1,500\u00a0\n100\u00a0\n2034\nVillage Eateries (4)\nNew York-New York\nHotel\u00a0and Casino\nLas Vegas, Nevada\n1997\n6,300\u00a0\n400\u00a0\n(*)\n2035\nYolos\nPlanet Hollywood\nResort and Casino\nLas Vegas, Nevada\n2007\n4,100\u00a0\n206\u00a0\n2026\nRobert\nMuseum of Arts\u00a0& Design\nNew York, New York\n2009\n5,530\u00a0\n150\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2035\nBroadway Burger Bar and Grill\nTropicana Hotel and Casino\nAtlantic City, New Jersey\n2013\n6,825\u00a0\n225\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2033\nThe Rustic Inn\nDania Beach, Florida\n2014\n16,150\u00a0\n575\u00a0\n(75)\nOwned\nThe Porch at Bryant Park (5)\nBryant Park\nNew York, New York\n2015\n2,240\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n(160)\n2025\nShuckers\nJensen Beach, Florida\n2016\n7,310\u00a0\n220\u00a0\n(170)\nOwned\nThe Original Oyster House\nGulf Shores, Alabama\n2017\n9,230\u00a0\n300\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOwned\nThe Original Oyster House\nSpanish Fort, Alabama\n2017\n10,500\u00a0\n420\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOwned\nJB's on the Beach\nDeerfield Beach, Florida\n2019\n10,000\u00a0\n365\u00a0\n(100)\n2044\nBlue Moon Fish Company\nLauderdale-by-the-Sea, Florida\n2021\n4,800\u00a0\n240\u00a0\n(30)\n2046\n__________________________________\n(1)\nRestaurants are, from time to time, renovated, renamed and/or converted from or to managed or owned facilities. \u201cYear Opened\u201d refers to the year in which we, or an affiliated predecessor of us, first opened, acquired or began managing a restaurant at the applicable location, notwithstanding that the restaurant may have been renovated, renamed and/or converted from or to a managed or owned facility since that date.\n(2)\nSeating capacity refers to the seating capacity of the indoor part of a restaurant available for dining in all seasons and weather conditions.

In connection with the extension, the Company has agreed to spend a minimum of $1,500,000 to materially refresh the premises by April 30, 2023 (as extended from September 30, 2022 due to supply chain issues), subject to additional extensions as set out in the agreement. \nOn June 24, 2022, the Company extended its lease for \nAmerica \nat the New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, NV through December 31, 2033. In connection with the extension, the Company has agreed to spend a minimum of $4,000,000 to materially refresh the premises by December 31, 2024, subject to various extensions as set out in the agreement.\nOn July 21, 2022, the Company extended its lease for the \nVillage Eateries\n at the New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, NV through December 31, 2034.  As part of this extension, the \nBroadway Burger Bar and Grill\n and \nGonzalez y Gonzalez\n, were carved out of the \nVillage Eateries\n footprint and the extended date for each of those two locations is December 31, 2033. In \n7\nconnection with the extension, the Company has agreed to spend a minimum of $3,500,000 to materially refresh all three of these premises by June 30, 2023, subject to various extensions as set out in the agreement.\nThe above refresh obligations related to the New York-New York Hotel and Casino lease extensions are to be consistent with designs approved by the Landlord, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.  We will continue to pay all rent as required by the leases without abatement during construction.  Note that our substantial completion of work set forth in plans approved by the Landlord shall constitute our compliance with the requirements of the completion deadlines, regardless of whether or not the amount actually expended in connection therewith is less than the minimum.\nThe opening of a new restaurant is invariably accompanied by substantial pre-opening expenses and early operating losses associated with the training of personnel, excess kitchen costs, costs of supervision and other expenses during the pre-opening period and during a post-opening \u201cshake out\u201d period until operations can be considered to be functioning normally. The amount of such pre-opening expenses and early operating losses can generally be expected to depend upon the size and complexity of the facility being opened.\nOur restaurants generally do not achieve substantial increases in revenue from year to year, which we consider to be typical of the restaurant industry. To achieve significant increases in revenue or to replace revenue of restaurants that lose customer favor or which close because of lease expirations or other reasons, we would have to open additional restaurant facilities or expand existing restaurants. There can be no assurance that a restaurant will be successful after it is opened, particularly since in many instances we do not operate our new restaurants under a trade name currently used by us, thereby requiring new restaurants to establish their own identity.\nWe may take advantage of other opportunities we consider to be favorable, when they occur, depending upon the availability of financing and other factors.\nRecent Restaurant Dispositions\nOn July 5, 2022, the Company terminated its lease for \nLucky 7\n at the Foxwoods Resort Casino.  The closure did not result in a material change to the Company's operations.  \nInvestment in New Meadowlands Racetrack LLC\nOn March 12, 2013, the Company made a $4,200,000 investment in the New Meadowlands Racetrack LLC (\u201cNMR\u201d) through its purchase of a membership interest in Meadowlands Newmark, LLC, an existing member of NMR. On November 19, 2013, the Company invested an additional $464,000 in NMR through a purchase of an additional membership interest in Meadowlands Newmark, LLC resulting in a total ownership of 11.6% of Meadowlands Newmark, LLC, and an effective ownership interest in NMR of 7.4%, subject to dilution. In 2015, the Company invested an additional $222,000 in NMR and in February 2017 the Company invested an additional $222,000 in NMR, both as a result of capital calls, bringing its total investment to $5,108,000 with no change in ownership.\nIn addition to the Company\u2019s ownership interest in NMR, if casino gaming is approved at the Meadowlands and NMR is granted the right to conduct said gaming, the Company shall be granted the exclusive right to operate the food and beverage concessions in the gaming facility with the exception of one restaurant.\nIn conjunction with this investment, the Company, through a 97% owned subsidiary, Ark Meadowlands LLC (\u201cAM VIE\u201d), also entered into a long-term agreement with NMR for the exclusive right to operate food and beverage concessions serving the new raceway facilities (the \u201cRacing F&B Concessions\u201d) located in the new raceway grandstand constructed at the Meadowlands Racetrack in northern New Jersey. Under the agreement, NMR is responsible to pay for the costs and expenses incurred in the operation of the Racing F&B Concessions, and all revenues and profits thereof inure to the benefit of NMR. AM VIE receives an annual fee equal to 5% of the net profits received by NMR from the Racing F&B Concessions during each calendar year.\nOn April 25, 2014, the Company loaned $1,500,000 to Meadowlands Newmark, LLC. The note bears interest at 3%, compounded monthly and added to the principal, and is due in its entirety on January 31, 2024. The note may be prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time without penalty or premium. On July 13, 2016, the Company made an additional loan to Meadowlands Newmark, LLC in the amount of $200,000. Such amount is subject to the same terms and conditions as the original loan discussed above. The principal and accrued interest related to this note, after a $500,000 payment made in July 2021, in the amounts of $1,357,000 and $1,317,000, are included in Investment In and Receivable From New Meadowlands Racetrack in the consolidated balance sheets at October\u00a01, 2022 and October\u00a02, 2021, respectively.\nOn June 7, 2018, the New Jersey State Legislature voted to legalize sports betting at casinos and racetracks in the State. Pursuant to this legislation, NMR operates a sports book in partnership with FanDuel, a leading provider of daily fantasy sports. \n8\nRestaurant Management\nEach restaurant is managed by its own manager and has its own chef. Food products and other supplies are purchased primarily from various unaffiliated suppliers, in most cases by our headquarters' personnel. Each of our restaurants has two or more assistant managers and sous chefs (assistant chefs). Financial and management control is maintained at the corporate level through the use of automated systems that include centralized accounting and reporting.\nPurchasing and Distribution\nWe strive to obtain quality menu ingredients, raw materials and other supplies and services for our operations from reliable sources at competitive prices. Substantially all menu items are prepared on each restaurant\u2019s premises daily from scratch, using fresh ingredients. Each restaurant\u2019s management determines the quantities of food and supplies required and then orders the items from local, regional and national suppliers on terms negotiated by our centralized purchasing staff. Restaurant-level inventories are maintained at a minimum dollar-value level in relation to sales due to the relatively rapid turnover of the perishable produce, poultry, meat, fish and dairy commodities that are used in operations.\nWe attempt to negotiate short-term and long-term supply agreements depending on market conditions and expected demand. However, we do not contract for long periods of time for our fresh commodities such as produce, poultry, meat, fish and dairy items and, consequently, such commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations. Independent food service distributors deliver most food and supply items daily to restaurants. The financial impact of the termination of any such supply agreements would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position.  We believe that we have established stable long-term relationships with several key suppliers, particularly with respect to crabs and other shellfish.  Nevertheless, as a result of global restrictions and the disruption in our product supply chain as a result of COVID-19, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, product supply delays from our third-party vendors and shortages of product supply.  \nCompetition\nThe hospitality industry is highly competitive and is often affected by changes in taste and entertainment trends among the public, by local, national and economic conditions affecting spending habits, and by population and traffic patterns. We believe that the principal means of competition among restaurants include the location, type and quality of facilities and the type, quality and price of beverage and food served.\nOur restaurants compete directly or indirectly with many well-established competitors, both nationally and locally owned, some with substantially greater financial resources than we have. Their resources and market presence may provide advantages in marketing, purchasing and negotiating leases. We compete with other restaurant and retail establishments for sites and finding management personnel.\nEmployees\nAt December 10, 2022, we employed 1,901 persons (including employees at managed facilities), 339 of whom were full-time employees, and 1,562 of whom were part-time employees; 41 of whom were headquarters personnel, 172 of whom were restaurant management personnel, 650 of whom were kitchen personnel and 769 of whom were restaurant service personnel. A number of our restaurant service personnel are employed on a part-time basis. Changes in minimum wage levels may adversely affect our labor costs and the restaurant industry generally because a large percentage of restaurant personnel are paid at or slightly above the minimum wage. Our employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreements.\nWe have experienced aggressive competition for talent, wage inflation and pressure to improve workplace conditions and benefits as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The pandemic itself has caused a shortage of labor for restaurant positions as concern over exposure to COVID-19 and other factors decreased the pool of available qualified talent for key roles.  Our compensation packages may prove insufficient to attract and retain the best personnel in light of the challenges posed by the pandemic and wage pressures resulting from the labor shortage.  Higher employee turnover levels or our failure to recruit and retain new restaurant employees in a timely manner could impact our ability to grow sales at existing restaurants or open new restaurants and result in higher than projected labor costs.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting our business. Each restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities that may include alcoholic beverage control, health, sanitation, environmental, zoning and public safety agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located. Difficulties in obtaining or failures to obtain the required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the development and openings of new restaurants, or could disrupt the operations of existing restaurants.\n9\nAlcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our restaurants to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county and municipal authorities for licenses and permits to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be subject to penalties, temporary suspension or revocation for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations impact many aspects of the daily operations of our restaurants, including the minimum ages of patrons and employees consuming or serving such beverages; employee alcoholic beverages training and certification requirements; hours of operation; advertising; wholesale purchasing and inventory control of such beverages; seating of minors and the service of food within our bar areas; and the storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. State and local authorities in many jurisdictions routinely monitor compliance with alcoholic beverage laws. The failure to receive or retain, or a delay in obtaining, a liquor license for a particular restaurant could adversely affect our ability to obtain such licenses in jurisdictions where the failure to receive or retain, or a delay in obtaining, a liquor license occurred.\nThe New York State Liquor Authority must approve any transaction in which a shareholder of the licensee increases his holdings to 10% or more of the outstanding capital stock of the licensee and any transaction involving 10% or more of the outstanding capital stock of the licensee.\nWe are subject to \u201cdram-shop\u201d statutes in most of the states in which we have operations, which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to such person. We carry liquor liability coverage as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance. A settlement or judgment against us under a \u201cdram-shop\u201d statute in excess of liability coverage could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nVarious federal and state labor laws govern our operations and our relationship with employees, including such matters as minimum wages, breaks, overtime, fringe benefits, safety, working conditions and citizenship requirements. We are also subject to the regulations of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. If our employees do not meet federal citizenship or residency requirements, their deportation could lead to a disruption in our work force. Significant government-imposed increases in minimum wages, paid leaves of absence and mandated health benefits, or increased tax reporting, assessment or payment requirements related to employees who receive gratuities could be detrimental to our profitability.\nOur facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (\u201cADA\u201d) and related state statutes. The ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability with respect to public accommodations and employment. Under the ADA and related state laws, when constructing new restaurants or undertaking significant remodeling of existing restaurants, we must make them more readily accessible to disabled persons.\nSeasonal Nature of Business\nOur business is highly seasonal; however, our broader geographical reach as a result of recent acquisitions mitigates some of the risk.  For instance, the second quarter of our fiscal year, consisting of the non-holiday portion of the cold weather season in New York and Washington (January, February and March), is the poorest performing quarter; however, in recent years this has been partially offset by our locations in Florida as they experience increased results in the winter months. We achieve our best results during the warm weather, attributable to our extensive outdoor dining availability, particularly at \nBryant Park\n in New York and \nSequoia\n in Washington, D.C. (our largest restaurants) and our outdoor cafes. However, even during summer months these facilities can be adversely affected by unusually cool or rainy weather conditions. Our facilities in Las Vegas are indoor and generally operate on a more consistent basis throughout the year.\nAvailable Information\nWe make available free of charge through our Internet website, \nwww.arkrestaurants.com\n, our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, statements of beneficial ownership of securities on Forms 3, 4 and 5 and amendments to these reports and statements filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) and Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.\nThe above information is also available at the SEC\u2019s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy at United States Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549-0213 or obtainable by calling the SEC at (800) 732-0330.

This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties.  Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to, those discussed elsewhere in this annual report.  Please see the discussion of forward-looking statements at the beginning of this annual report under \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\".\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nRecent global events, including the COVID-19 pandemic (\"COVID-19\"), have adversely affected global economies, disrupted global supply chains and labor force participation and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. \nWe experienced significant and variable disruptions to our business as federal, state and local restrictions were mandated, among other remedial measures, to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus. During fiscal 2021, most of our restaurants operated with no restrictions on indoor dining, although there was a significant reduction in guest traffic at our restaurants due to changes in consumer behavior as public health officials encouraged social distancing. While restrictions on the type of permitted operating model and occupancy capacity may continue to change, during fiscal 2022 all of our restaurants operated with no restrictions.\nDuring fiscal 2022, in addition to the associated impact of COVID-19, our operating results have been impacted by geopolitical and other macroeconomic factors, leading to increased commodity and wage inflation and other increased costs.  The ongoing effects of COVID-19 and its variants, along with other geopolitical and macroeconomic events, could lead to further government mandates, including but not limited to capacity restrictions, shifts in consumer behavior, wage inflation, staffing challenges, product and services cost inflation and disruptions in our supply chain.  If these factors significantly impact our cash flow in the future, we may again implement mitigation actions such as suspending dividends, increasing borrowings or modifying our operating strategies. Some of these measures may have an adverse impact on our business, including possible impairments of assets.\nOverview\nAs of October\u00a01, 2022, the Company owned and operated 17 restaurants and bars, 16 fast food concepts and catering operations, exclusively in the United States, that have similar economic characteristics, nature of products and service, class of customer and distribution methods. The Company believes it meets the criteria for aggregating its operating segments into a single reporting segment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.   \nAccounting Period\nOur fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest September 30. We report fiscal years under a 52/53-week format. This reporting method is used by many companies in the hospitality industry and is meant to improve year-to-year comparisons of operating results. Under this method, certain years will contain 53 weeks. The fiscal years ended October\u00a01, 2022 and October\u00a02, 2021 both included 52 weeks.\n14\nSeasonality\nThe Company has substantial fixed costs that do not decline proportionally with sales.  Although our business is highly seasonal, our broader geographical reach as a result of recent acquisitions mitigates some of the risk.  For instance, the second quarter of our fiscal year, consisting of the non-holiday portion of the cold weather season in New York and Washington (January, February and March), is the poorest performing quarter; however, in recent years this has been partially offset by our locations in Florida as they experience increased results in the winter months.  We generally achieve our best results during the warm weather, attributable to our extensive outdoor dining availability, particularly at \nBryant Park\n in New York and \nSequoia\n in Washington, D.C. (our largest restaurants) and our outdoor cafes.  However, even during summer months these facilities can be adversely affected by unusually cool or rainy weather conditions. Our facilities in Las Vegas are indoor and generally operate on a more consistent basis throughout the year.   \nResults of Operations\nThe Company\u2019s operating income for the year ended October\u00a01, 2022 increased 58.9% from $9,864,000 as compared to $6,207,000 for the year ended October\u00a02, 2021.  This increase resulted primarily from a 39.3% increase in revenues, as all of our restaurants were operating with no dining restrictions in the current period in comparison to the prior period as a result of government mandates in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by increases in commodity prices and other high-volume items caused by inflation, increased labor costs in connection with ongoing COVID-related labor challenges and percentage rents paid on higher sales in the current year.  \nThe following table summarizes the significant components of the Company\u2019s operating results for the years ended October\u00a01, 2022 and October\u00a02, 2021, respectively:\nYear Ended\nVariance\nOctober 1,\n2022\nOctober 2,\n2021\n$\n%\nREVENUES:\n(in thousands)\nFood and beverage sales\n$\n180,010\u00a0\n$\n128,988\u00a0\n$\n51,022\u00a0\n39.6\u00a0\n%\nOther revenue\n3,664\u00a0\n2,882\u00a0\n782\u00a0\n27.1\u00a0\n%\nTotal revenues\n183,674\u00a0\n131,870\u00a0\n51,804\u00a0\n39.3\u00a0\n%\nCOSTS AND EXPENSES:\nFood and beverage cost of sales\n52,573\u00a0\n38,950\u00a0\n13,623\u00a0\n35.0\u00a0\n%\nPayroll expenses\n60,000\u00a0\n42,579\u00a0\n17,421\u00a0\n40.9\u00a0\n%\nOccupancy expenses\n22,181\u00a0\n14,747\u00a0\n7,434\u00a0\n50.4\u00a0\n%\nOther operating costs and expenses\n21,823\u00a0\n16,044\u00a0\n5,779\u00a0\n36.0\u00a0\n%\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n12,936\u00a0\n10,523\u00a0\n2,413\u00a0\n22.9\u00a0\n%\nGain on lease termination\n\u2014\u00a0\n(810)\n810\u00a0\nN/A\nDepreciation and amortization\n4,297\u00a0\n3,630\u00a0\n667\u00a0\n18.4\u00a0\n%\nTotal costs and expenses\n173,810\u00a0\n125,663\u00a0\n48,147\u00a0\n38.3\u00a0\n%\nOPERATING INCOME \n$\n9,864\u00a0\n$\n6,207\u00a0\n$\n3,657\u00a0\n58.9\u00a0\n%\nRevenues\nDuring the year ended October\u00a01, 2022, revenues increased 39.3% as compared to revenues for the year ended October\u00a02, 2021.  This increase resulted primarily from increased customer traffic at all of our properties as they are operating with no dining restrictions in the current period in comparison to the prior period where there were restrictions as a result of government mandates in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic combined with targeted menu price increases and in New York and Washington, D.C., strong revenues from our event business in the current period. \n15\nFood and Beverage Same-Store Sales\nOn a Company-wide basis, same-store food and beverage sales increased 38.1% for the year ended October\u00a01, 2022 as compared to the year ended October\u00a02, 2021 as follows:\nYear Ended\nVariance\nOctober 1,\n2022\nOctober 2,\n2021\n$\n%\n(in thousands)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLas Vegas\n$\n55,364\u00a0\n$\n37,767\u00a0\n$\n17,597\u00a0\n46.6\u00a0\n%\nNew York\n33,408\u00a0\n15,037\u00a0\n18,371\u00a0\n122.2\u00a0\n%\nWashington, D.C.\n10,611\u00a0\n8,169\u00a0\n2,442\u00a0\n29.9\u00a0\n%\nAtlantic City, NJ\n3,555\u00a0\n2,055\u00a0\n1,500\u00a0\n73.0\u00a0\n%\nAlabama\n16,749\u00a0\n14,506\u00a0\n2,243\u00a0\n15.5\u00a0\n%\nFlorida\n57,535\u00a0\n50,818\u00a0\n6,717\u00a0\n13.2\u00a0\n%\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Same-store sales\n177,222\u00a0\n128,352\u00a0\n$\n48,870\u00a0\n38.1\u00a0\n%\nOther\n2,788\u00a0\n636\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Food and beverage sales\n$\n180,010\u00a0\n$\n128,988\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe increases in company-wide same-store sales for the year ended October 1, 2022 as compared to the prior year were driven primarily by increased customer traffic as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prior period combined with targeted increases in menu pricing and a strong recovery in our event business in Washington, D.C. and New York City in the current period. \nOther food and beverage sales consist of current year for pre-acquisition periods of restaurants opened or acquired during the applicable period (\nBlue Moon Fish Company \n- see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Recent Expansion and Other Developments), sales related to properties that were closed (\nClyde Frazier's Wine and Dine, Lucky 7 \nand\n Gallagher's Steakhouse \nand\n Gallagher's Burger Bar - \nsee Liquidity and Capital Resources - Recent Restaurant Dispositions) and other adjustments and fees.\nPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic, our restaurants generally did not achieve substantial increases in revenue from year to year, which we consider to be typical of the restaurant industry. To achieve significant increases in revenue or to replace revenue of restaurants that lose customer favor or which close because of lease expirations or other reasons, we would have to open additional restaurant facilities or expand existing restaurants. There can be no assurance that a restaurant will be successful after it is opened, particularly since in many instances we do not operate our new restaurants under a trade name currently used by us, thereby requiring new restaurants to establish their own identity.\nOther Revenues\nIncluded in other revenues are purchase service fees which represent commissions earned by a subsidiary of the Company for providing purchasing services to other restaurant groups, as well as merchandise sales, license fees, property management fees and other rentals. The increase in other revenues for the year ended October\u00a01, 2022 as compared to the year ended October\u00a02, 2021 is primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year.\n16\nCosts and Expenses\nCosts and expenses for the years ended October\u00a01, 2022 and October\u00a02, 2021 were as follows (in thousands):\n\u00a0\nYear Ended\nOctober 1,\n\u00a02022\n% to\nTotal Revenues\nYear Ended\nOctober 2,\n\u00a02021\n% to\nTotal Revenues\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\n\u00a0\n$\n%\nFood and beverage cost of sales\n$\n52,573\u00a0\n28.6\u00a0\n%\n$\n38,950\u00a0\n29.5\u00a0\n%\n$\n13,623\u00a0\n35.0\u00a0\n%\nPayroll expenses\n60,000\u00a0\n32.7\u00a0\n%\n42,579\u00a0\n32.3\u00a0\n%\n17,421\u00a0\n40.9\u00a0\n%\nOccupancy expenses\n22,181\u00a0\n12.1\u00a0\n%\n14,747\u00a0\n11.2\u00a0\n%\n7,434\u00a0\n50.4\u00a0\n%\nOther operating costs and expenses\n21,823\u00a0\n11.9\u00a0\n%\n16,044\u00a0\n12.2\u00a0\n%\n5,779\u00a0\n36.0\u00a0\n%\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n12,936\u00a0\n7.0\u00a0\n%\n10,523\u00a0\n8.0\u00a0\n%\n2,413\u00a0\n22.9\u00a0\n%\nGain on lease termination\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n%\n(810)\n-0.6\u00a0\n%\n810\u00a0\nN/A\nDepreciation and amortization\n4,297\u00a0\n2.3\u00a0\n%\n3,630\u00a0\n2.8\u00a0\n%\n667\u00a0\n18.4\u00a0\n%\nTotal costs and expenses\n$\n173,810\u00a0\n$\n125,663\u00a0\n$\n48,147\u00a0\nFood and beverage costs as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended October\u00a01, 2022 decreased as compared to last year primarily as a result of targeted increases in menu pricing, changes in menu mix and a strong event business in Washington, D.C. and New York City in the current period, partially offset by increases in commodity prices and other high-volume items caused by inflation.  \nPayroll expenses as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended October\u00a01, 2022 increased as compared to last year primarily as a result of increased labor costs in connection with ongoing COVID-related labor challenges partially offset by increased volumes, targeted increases in menu pricing and changes in menu mix and a strong event business in Washington, D.C. and New York City in the current period.   \nOccupancy expenses as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended October\u00a01, 2022 increased as compared to last year primarily as a result of percentage rents paid on higher sales in the current period.   \nOther operating costs and expenses as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended October\u00a01, 2022 decreased as compared to last year as a result of the fixed nature of some of these expenses and lower sales in the prior period as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by increased maintenance at properties which was deferred as we were experiencing lower traffic in prior periods combined with higher restaurant-level professional fees in the current period. \nGeneral and administrative expenses (which relate solely to the corporate office in New York City) for the year ended October\u00a01, 2022 increased as compared to last year primarily as a result of increased bonus accruals combined with salary reductions of corporate personnel in the prior period as a result of the impacts on our business from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n \nDepreciation and amortization expense for the year ended October\u00a01, 2022 increased as compared to last year primarily as a result of assets placed in service in the current period.  \n \n \n  Gain on Lease Termination\nOn September 1, 2021, the Company advised the landlord of \nClyde Frazier's Wine and Dine\n that we would be closing the property permanently and terminating the lease.  In connection with this notification, the Company recorded a gain of $810,000 during the year ended October 2, 2021 consisting of: (i) rent and other costs incurred in accordance with the termination provisions of the lease in the amount of $318,000, (ii) impairment of long-lived assets in the amount of $69,000 and (iii) the write-off of our security deposit in the amount of $121,000 offset by the write-off of ROU assets and related lease liabilities in the net amount of $1,318,000.    \n \nImpairment loss from write-down of long-lived assets\nManagement continually evaluates unfavorable cash flows, if any, related to underperforming restaurants. Periodically it is concluded that certain properties have become impaired based on their existing and anticipated future economic outlook in their respective markets. In such instances, we may impair assets to reduce their carrying values to fair values. Estimated fair values of impaired properties are based on comparable valuations, cash flows and/or management judgment.  Included in depreciation and amortization for the year ended October 2, 2021 is an impairment charge of $69,000 related to \nClyde Frazier's Wine and Dine.\n17\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for uncertain tax positions reflect management\u2019s best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income tax in numerous state taxing jurisdictions. Significant judgment and estimates are required in the determination of consolidated income tax expense. The provision for income taxes reflects federal income taxes calculated on a consolidated basis and state and local income taxes which are calculated on a separate entity basis.\nFor state and local income tax purposes, certain losses incurred by a subsidiary may only be used to offset that subsidiary\u2019s income, with the exception of the restaurants operating in the District of Columbia. Accordingly, our overall effective tax rate has varied depending on the level of income and losses incurred at individual subsidiaries.\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. The assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the \u201cAct\u201d) was signed into U.S. law on August 16, 2022.   The Act includes various tax provisions, including an excise tax on stock repurchases, expanded tax credits for clean energy incentives, and a corporate alternative minimum tax that generally applies to U.S. corporations with average adjusted financial statement income over a three-year period in excess of $1 billion.  The Company does not expect the Act to materially impact its financial statements.\nOn March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted to provide economic relief to those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the PPP loans, the CARES Act made various tax law changes including among other things (i) modifications to the federal net operating loss rules including permitting federal net operating losses incurred in 2018, 2019, and 2020 tax years to be carried back to the five preceding taxable years in order to generate a refund of previously paid income taxes, (ii) enhanced recoverability of AMT tax credit carryforwards, (iii) increased the limitation under Internal Revenue Code (\"IRC\") Section 163(j) for 2019 and 2020 to permit additional expensing of interest, and (iv) enacted a technical correction so that qualified improvement property can be immediately expensed under IRC Section 168(k).\nOn  December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (\u201cCAA\u201d) was enacted and provided clarification on the tax deductibility of expenses funded with PPP loans as fully deductible for tax purposes. During the years ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, the Company recorded income of $2,420,000 and $10,400,000, respectively (including $65,000 and $84,000 of accrued interest, respectively), for financial reporting purposes related to the forgiveness of  its PPP Loans. The forgiveness of these amounts is not taxable.\nAs a result of the CARES Act and the CAA, the Company carried back taxable losses from fiscal years 2020 and 2021 to generate a refund of previously paid income taxes. As a result of these carrybacks, the Company recorded income tax benefits as the taxable losses from fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 are being carried back to tax years in which the Company was subject to a higher federal corporate income tax rate.  Included in Prepaid and Refundable Income Taxes at October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021 is $1,360,000 and $3,766,000, respectively, related to these carryback claims. \nThe Company\u2019s overall effective tax rate in the future will be affected by factors such as the utilization of state and local net operating loss carryforwards, the generation of FICA tax credits and the mix of earnings by state taxing jurisdictions as Nevada does not impose a state income tax, as compared to the other major state and local jurisdictions in which the Company has operations. Our overall effective tax rate in the future will be affected by factors such as income earned by our VIEs, generation of FICA TIP credits and the mix of geographical income for state tax purposes as Nevada does not impose an income tax.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary source of capital has been cash provided by operations and, in recent years, bank and other borrowings to finance specific transactions, acquisitions and large remodeling projects. We utilize cash generated from operations to fund the cost of developing and opening new restaurants and smaller remodeling projects of existing restaurants we own.  Consistent with many other restaurant operators, we typically use operating lease arrangements for our restaurants.  In recent years we have been able to acquire the underlying real estate at several locations along with the restaurant operation.  We believe that our operating lease arrangements provide appropriate leverage of our capital structure in a financially efficient manner.  As of October\u00a01, 2022, we \n18\nhad a cash and cash equivalents balance of $23,439,000 and a certificate of deposit in the amount of $5,021,000 maturing in January 2023.\nWe experienced significant disruptions to our business as federal, state and local restrictions were mandated to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus.  While restrictions on the type of permitted operating model and occupancy capacity may continue to change, during fiscal 2022 all of our restaurants operated with no restrictions.  During fiscal 2021, most of our restaurants operated with no restrictions on indoor dining, although there were impacts to our business from accelerating case counts.  During fiscal 2022, along with the impacts of COVID-19, our operating results have been impacted by geopolitical and other macroeconomic factors, leading to increased commodity and wage inflation and other increased costs.  The ongoing effects of COVID-19 and its variants, along with other geopolitical and macroeconomic events, could lead to further government mandates, including but not limited to capacity restrictions, shifts in consumer behavior, wage inflation, staffing challenges, product and services cost inflation and disruptions in the supply chain.  If these factors significantly impact our cash flow in the future, we may again implement mitigation actions such as suspending dividends, increasing borrowings or modifying our operating strategies. Some of these measures may have an adverse impact on our business, including possible impairments of assets.\nThe Company had working capital of $4,210,000 at October\u00a01, 2022 as compared to $2,572,000 at October\u00a02, 2021.  This increase resulted primarily from cash provided by operations offset by a change in our debt maturities in connection with conversion of our revolving credit borrowings to term loans and the resumption of the payment of dividends in June 2022.  We believe that our existing cash balances and current banking facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital spending requirements and finance our operating activities for at least the next 12 months.\nCash Flows for the Years Ended October\u00a01, 2022 and October\u00a02, 2021\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended October\u00a01, 2022 increased to $20,347,000 as compared to $9,294,000 for the year ended October\u00a02, 2021.  This increase was attributable to an increase in operating income as a result of the continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in net working capital primarily related to accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid, refundable and accrued income taxes and accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the years ended October\u00a01, 2022 and October\u00a02, 2021 was $(7,761,000) and $(3,450,000), respectively, and resulted primarily from purchases of fixed assets at existing restaurants and, in the current period, the purchase of a certificate of deposit in the amount of $5,000,000. \nNet cash used in financing activities for the years ended October\u00a01, 2022 and October 2, 2021 was $(8,318,000) and $(3,559,000), respectively, and resulted primarily from principal payments on notes payable, the payment of distributions to non-controlling interest and, in the current period, the resumption of the payment of dividends, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises.  \nOn May 11, 2022 and August 10, 2022, the Board of Directors (the \"Board\") of the Company declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.125 per share which were paid on June 13, 2022 and September 13, 2022 to the stockholders of record of each share of the Company's common stock at the close of business on May 31, 2022 and August 31, 2022.  The payment of future dividends, and the amount of any dividend, is at the discretion of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors and is based on future earnings, cash flow, financial condition, capital requirements and other relevant factors.   \nRestaurant Expansion and Other Developments\nOn April 8, 2022, the Company extended its lease for \nGallagher's Steakhouse\n at the New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, NV through December 31, 2032. In connection with the extension, the Company has agreed to spend a minimum of $1,500,000 to materially refresh the premises by April 30, 2023 (as extended from September 30, 2022 due to supply chain issues), subject to additional extensions as set out in the agreement. \nOn June 24, 2022, the Company extended its lease for \nAmerica\n at the New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, NV through December 31, 2033. In connection with the extension, the Company has agreed to spend a minimum of $4,000,000 to materially refresh the premises by December 31, 2024, subject to various extensions as set out in the agreement.\nOn July 21, 2022, the Company extended its lease for the \nVillage Eateries \nat the New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, NV through December 31, 2034.  As part of this extension, the \nBroadway Burger Bar and Grill\n and \nGonzalez y Gonzalez\n, were carved out of the \nVillage Eateries \nfootprint and the extended date for each of those two locations is December 31, 2033.  In connection with the extension, the Company has agreed to spend a minimum of $3,500,000 to materially refresh all three of these premises by June 30, 2023, subject to various extensions as set out in the agreement.\n19\nThe above refresh obligations related to the New York-New York Hotel and Casino lease extensions are to be consistent with designs approved by the Landlord which shall not be unreasonably withheld.  We will continue to pay all rent as required by the leases without abatement during construction.  Note that our substantial completion of work set forth in plans approved by the Landlord shall constitute our compliance with the requirements of the completion deadlines, regardless of whether or not the amount actually expended in connection therewith is less than the minimum.\nThe opening of a new restaurant is invariably accompanied by substantial pre-opening expenses and early operating losses associated with the training of personnel, excess kitchen costs, costs of supervision and other expenses during the pre-opening period and during a post-opening \u201cshake out\u201d period until operations can be considered to be functioning normally. The amount of such pre-opening expenses and early operating losses can generally be expected to depend upon the size and complexity of the facility being opened.\nOur restaurants generally do not achieve substantial increases in revenue from year to year, which we consider to be typical of the restaurant industry. To achieve significant increases in revenue or to replace revenue of restaurants that lose customer favor or which close because of lease expirations or other reasons, we would have to open additional restaurant facilities or expand existing restaurants. There can be no assurance that a restaurant will be successful after it is opened, particularly since in many instances we do not operate our new restaurants under a trade name currently used by us, thereby requiring new restaurants to establish their own identity.\nWe may take advantage of other opportunities we consider to be favorable, when they occur, depending upon the availability of financing and other factors.\nRecent Restaurant Dispositions\nOn July 5, 2022, the Company terminated its lease for \nLucky 7\n at the Foxwoods Resort Casino.  The closure did not result in a material change to the Company's operations.  \nInvestment in and Receivable from New Meadowlands Racetrack\nOn March 12, 2013, the Company made a $4,200,000 investment in the New Meadowlands Racetrack LLC (\u201cNMR\u201d) through its purchase of a membership interest in Meadowlands Newmark, LLC, an existing member of NMR. On November 19, 2013, the Company invested an additional $464,000 in NMR through a purchase of an additional membership interest in Meadowlands Newmark, LLC resulting in a total ownership of 11.6% of Meadowlands Newmark, LLC, and an effective ownership interest in NMR of 7.4%, subject to dilution. In 2015, the Company invested an additional $222,000 in NMR with no change in ownership. In February 2017, the Company funded its proportionate share ($222,000) of a $3,000,000 capital call bringing its total investment to $5,108,000 with no change in ownership.\nIn addition to the Company\u2019s ownership interest in NMR, if casino gaming is approved at the Meadowlands and NMR is granted the right to conduct said gaming, the Company shall be granted the exclusive right to operate the food and beverage concessions in the gaming facility with the exception of one restaurant.\nIn conjunction with this investment, the Company, through a 97% owned subsidiary, Ark Meadowlands LLC (\u201cAM VIE\u201d), also entered into a long-term agreement with NMR for the exclusive right to operate food and beverage concessions serving the new raceway facilities (the \u201cRacing F&B Concessions\u201d) located in the new raceway grandstand constructed at the Meadowlands Racetrack in northern New Jersey. Under the agreement, NMR is responsible to pay for the costs and expenses incurred in the operation of the Racing F&B Concessions, and all revenues and profits thereof inure to the benefit of NMR. AM VIE receives an annual fee equal to 5% of the net profits received by NMR from the Racing F&B Concessions during each calendar year.\nOn April 25, 2014, the Company loaned $1,500,000 to Meadowlands Newmark, LLC. The note bears interest at 3%, compounded monthly and added to the principal, and is due in its entirety on January 31, 2024. The note may be prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time without penalty or premium. On July 13, 2016, the Company made an additional loan to Meadowlands Newmark, LLC in the amount of $200,000. Such amount is subject to the same terms and conditions as the original loan as discussed above.  The principal and accrued interest related to this note, after a $500,000 payment made in July 2021, in the amounts of $1,357,000 and $1,317,000, are included in Investment In and Receivable From New Meadowlands Racetrack in the consolidated balance sheets at October\u00a01, 2022 and October\u00a02, 2021, respectively.\nOn June 7, 2018, the New Jersey State Legislature voted to legalize sports betting at casinos and racetracks in the state. Pursuant to this legislation, NMR operates a sports book in partnership with FanDuel, a leading provider of daily fantasy sports. \n20\nNotes Payable \u2013 Bank\nOn June 1, 2018, the Company refinanced (the \"Refinancing\") its then existing indebtedness with its current lender, Bank Hapoalim B.M. (\u201cBHBM\u201d), by entering into an amended and restated credit agreement (the \u201cRevolving Facility\u201d), which was to mature on May 19, 2022 (as extended). The Revolving Facility provided for total availability of the lesser of (i) $10,000,000 and (ii) $35,000,000 less the then aggregate amount of all indebtedness and obligations to BHBM. On July 26, 2021, all outstanding Revolver Borrowings, in the amount of $9,666,000, were converted to a promissory note with quarterly principal payments of $500,000 commencing on September 1, 2021, with a balloon payment of $2,166,000 on June 1, 2025. Such note bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.5% per annum.  We expect that the LIBOR rate will be discontinued by June 30, 2023 and will continue to work with BHBM to identify a suitable replacement rate and amend our debt agreements to reflect this new reference rate accordingly.  We do not expect the discontinuation of LIBOR as a reference rate in our debt agreements to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or materially affect our interest expense.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Facility, which include the promissory notes as discussed in Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements in the aggregate amount of $22,345,000, are secured by all tangible and intangible personal property (including accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, general intangibles, documents, chattel paper, instruments, letter-of-credit rights, investment property, intellectual property and deposit accounts) and fixtures of the Company.  The loan agreements provide, among other things, that the Company meet minimum quarterly tangible net worth amounts, maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and meet minimum annual net income amounts. The loan agreements also contain customary representations, warranties and affirmative covenants as well as customary negative covenants, subject to negotiated exceptions on liens, relating to other indebtedness, capital expenditures, liens, affiliate transactions, disposal of assets and certain changes in ownership.\nPaycheck Protection Program Loans\nDuring the year ended October 3, 2020, subsidiaries (the \u201cBorrowers\u201d) of the Company received loan proceeds from several banks (the \u201cLenders\u201d) in the aggregate amount of $14,995,000 (the \u201cPPP Loans\u201d) under the Paycheck Protection Program (the \u201cPPP\u201d) of the CARES Act, which was enacted March 27, 2020.  In addition, during the 13 weeks ended April 3, 2021, one of our consolidated VIEs received a second draw PPP Loan in the amount of $111,000.  The PPP Loans are evidenced by individual promissory notes of each of the Borrowers (together, the \u201cNotes\u201d) in favor of the Lender, which Notes bear interest at the rate of 1.00% per annum.  Under the terms of the PPP Loans, some or all of the amounts thereunder, including accrued interest, may be forgiven if they are used for Qualifying Expenses as described in and in compliance with the CARES Act.  While the Company and each Borrower believe that PPP Loan proceeds were used exclusively for Qualifying Expenses, it is unclear and uncertain whether the conditions for forgiveness of the remaining PPP Loans outstanding at October\u00a01, 2022 will be met under the current guidelines of the CARES Act. Therefore, we cannot make any assurances that the Company, or any of the Borrowers, will be eligible for forgiveness of the remaining PPP Loans in the amount of $797,000, in whole or in part.\nDuring the years ended October\u00a01, 2022 and October\u00a02, 2021, $2,420,000 and $10,400,000, respectively (including $65,000 and $84,000 of accrued interest, respectively), of PPP Loans were forgiven.  To the extent, if any, that any of the remaining PPP Loans are not forgiven, beginning one month following expiration of the Deferral Period, and continuing monthly for 10 months (the \u201cMaturity Date\u201d), each respective Borrower is obligated to make monthly payments of principal and interest to the Lender with respect to any unforgiven portion of the Notes, in such equal amounts required to fully amortize the principal amount outstanding on such Notes as of the last day of the applicable Deferral Period by the applicable Maturity Date.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. While all of these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\nWe believe that given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows for the periods presented in this report.\n21\nBelow are listed certain policies that management believes are critical:\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenues when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a restaurant guest or other customer. Revenues from restaurant operations are presented net of discounts, coupons, employee meals and complimentary meals and recognized when food, beverage and retail products are sold. Sales tax collected from customers is excluded from sales and the obligation is included in sales tax payable until the taxes are remitted to the appropriate taxing authorities. Catering service revenue is generated through contracts with customers whereby the customer agrees to pay a contract rate for the service. Revenues from catered events are recognized in income upon satisfaction of the performance obligation (the date the event is held) and all customer payments, including nonrefundable upfront deposits, are deferred as a liability until such time. \nRevenues from gift cards are deferred and recognized upon redemption. Deferrals are not reduced for potential non-use as we generally have a legal obligation to remit the value of unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdictions in which they are sold. \nOther revenues include purchase service fees which represent commissions earned by a subsidiary of the Company for providing purchasing services to other restaurant groups, as well as license fees, property management fees and other rentals.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The accounting estimates that require management\u2019s most difficult and subjective judgments include allowances for potential bad debts on receivables, the useful lives and recoverability of its assets, such as property and intangibles, fair values of financial instruments and share-based compensation, the realizable value of its tax assets and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Because of the uncertainty in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.\nLong-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In the evaluation of the fair value and future benefits of long-lived assets, management continually evaluates unfavorable cash flows, if any, related to underperforming restaurants. Periodically it is concluded that certain properties have become impaired based on their existing and anticipated future economic outlook in their respective markets. In such instances, we may impair assets to reduce their carrying values to fair values. Estimated fair values of impaired properties are based on comparable valuations, cash flows and/or management judgment. Management continually evaluates unfavorable cash flows, if any, related to underperforming restaurants. Periodically it is concluded that certain properties have become impaired based on their existing and anticipated future economic outlook in their respective markets. In such instances, we may impair assets to reduce their carrying values to fair values. Estimated fair values of impaired properties are based on comparable valuations, cash flows and/or management's judgment.  Included in the year ended October 2, 2021 is an impairment charge of $69,000 related to \nClyde Frazier's Wine and Dine.\nRecoverability of Investment in New Meadowlands Racetrack (\u201cNMR\u201d)\nThe carrying value of our investment in Meadowlands Newmark LLC, which has a 63.7% ownership in NMR, is determined using the cost method. In accordance with the cost method, our initial investment is recorded at cost and we record dividend income when applicable, if dividends are declared. We review our investment in NMR each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on its fair value.\nAs a result, we performed an assessment of the recoverability of our indirect investment in NMR as of October\u00a01, 2022 which involved critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management estimated include, among others, the probability of gambling being approved in northern New Jersey which is the most heavily weighted assumption and NMR obtaining a license to operate a casino, revenue levels, cost of capital, marketing spending, tax rates and capital spending.\nIn performing this assessment, we estimate the fair value of our investment in NMR using our best estimate of these assumptions which we believe would be consistent with what a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. The variability of these factors \n22\ndepends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events and our inability as a minority shareholder to control certain outcomes and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. If other assumptions and estimates had been used when these tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted.\nAs mentioned above, these factors do not change in isolation and, therefore, we do not believe it is practicable or meaningful to present the impact of changing a single factor. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods, future impairment charges could result.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. An arrangement contains a lease if it implicitly or explicitly identifies an asset to be used and conveys the right to control the use of the identified asset in exchange for consideration.\u00a0As a lessee, we include operating leases in Operating lease right-of-use assets and Operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.  Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized upon commencement of the lease based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term.\u00a0As most of our leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments.  Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease.\u00a0 Options are included when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.  Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\u00a0Amendments or modifications to lease terms are accounted for as variable lease payments.  Leases with a lease term of 12 months or less are accounted for using the practical expedient which allows for straight-line rent expense over the remaining term of the lease.\u00a0\nDeferred Income Tax Valuation Allowance\nWe provide such allowance due to uncertainty that some of the deferred tax amounts may not be realized. Certain items, such as state and local tax loss carryforwards, are dependent on future earnings or the availability of tax strategies. Future results could require an increase or decrease in the valuation allowance and a resulting adjustment to income in such period.\nGoodwill and Trademarks\nGoodwill and trademarks are not amortized, but are subject to impairment analysis. We assess the potential impairment of goodwill and trademarks annually (at the end of our fourth quarter) and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or trademarks are impaired, we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of income. \nSuch impairment analyses for goodwill requires a comparison of the fair value of the Company\u2019s equity to the carrying amount of goodwill since the Company operates in one segment. At October\u00a01, 2022 and October\u00a02, 2021, we performed qualitative assessments of factors to determine whether further impairment testing of goodwill was required.  Based on this assessment, no impairment losses were warranted at October\u00a01, 2022 and October\u00a02, 2021.  Qualitative factors considered in this assessment included industry and market considerations, overall financial performance and other relevant events, management expertise and stability at key positions. Additional impairment analyses at future dates may be performed to determine if indicators of impairment are present, and if so, such amount will be determined and the associated charge will be recorded to the consolidated statements of income.  \nOur impairment analysis for trademarks consists of a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the assets. This comparison is made based on a review of historical, current and forecasted sales and profit levels, as well as a review of any factors that may indicate potential impairment. For the years ended October\u00a01, 2022 and October\u00a02, 2021, our impairment analysis did not result in any other charges related to trademarks.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company measures stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognizes it as expense over the applicable vesting period using the straight-line method. Excess income tax benefits related to share-based compensation expense that must be recognized directly in equity are considered financing rather than operating cash flow activities.\nThe fair value of each of the Company\u2019s stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model that uses assumptions that relate to the expected volatility of the Company\u2019s common stock, the expected dividend yield of \n23\nour stock, the expected life of the options and the risk-free interest rate. The Company issues new shares upon the exercise of employee stock options.\nRecently Adopted and Issued Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including those adopted in fiscal 2022 and the expected dates of adoption and the anticipated impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Developments\nSee Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recent developments that have occurred subsequent to October 1, 2022.", "item7a": ">Item 7A\n. \nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nNot applicable.", "companyName": "ARK RESTAURANTS CORP", "cusip": "00214Q104"}
