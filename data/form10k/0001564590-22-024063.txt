In addition, the Company intends to continue entering into licenses for the use of its trade names and trademarks by third parties. See \u201cLicensing Activities.\u201d \n\n\nThe Company\u2019s core business consists of selling, distributing, and licensing various low and moderately priced houseware and consumer electronic products in various categories. All of the Company\u2019s marketing and sales efforts are currently concentrated in the United States.\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\nProducts \n\n\nThe Company\u2019s current product categories, which include licensed products, consist primarily of the following: \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHouseware Products\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAudio Products\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Microwave\u00a0Ovens\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Clock\u00a0Radios\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Massagers \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Compact Refrigerators\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 Bluetooth Speakers\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Toothbrushes \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Toaster Ovens\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nWireless Charging\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Security Products \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Wine Products \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSales and Distribution \n\n\nThe Company markets its products exclusively in the United States, primarily through mass merchandisers and online marketplaces. \n\n\nIn fiscal 2022, Walmart accounted for approximately 45%, Amazon.com accounted for approximately 32%, and Fred Meyer accounted for approximately 13% of the Company\u2019s net revenues. In fiscal 2021, Walmart accounted for approximately 37%, Amazon.com accounted for approximately 33%, and Fred Meyer accounted for approximately 11% of the Company\u2019s net revenues. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of net revenues in either period. As a percent of the Company\u2019s total trade accounts receivable, net of specific reserves, Walmart, Amazon.com and Fred Meyer accounted for approximately 69%, 17% and 11%, respectively, as of March 31, 2022. As a percent of the Company\u2019s total trade accounts receivable, net of specific reserves, Amazon.com and Walmart accounted for approximately 69% and 28%, respectively, as of March 31, 2021. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company\u2019s total trade accounts receivable, net of specific reserves, as of March 31, 2022 or March 31, 2021. Management believes that a loss, or a significant reduction, of sales to any of its key customers would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. \n\n\nApproximately 50% and 87% of the Company\u2019s net revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 (\u201cfiscal 2022\u201d) and the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 (\u201cfiscal 2021\u201d), respectively, were made through third-party sales representative organizations that receive sales commissions and work in conjunction with the Company\u2019s own sales personnel. With the Company\u2019s permission, third-party sales representative organizations may sell competitive products in addition to the Company\u2019s products. In most instances, either party may terminate a sales representative relationship on 30 days prior notice by the Company and 90 days prior notice by the sales representative organization in accordance with customary industry practice. In fiscal 2022, the Company utilized 4 sales representative organizations, including one which represented approximately 47% of its net revenues. In fiscal 2021, the Company utilized 4 sales representative organizations, including one which represented approximately 49% and another which represented approximately 30% of its net revenues. No other sales representative organization accounted for more than 10% of the Company\u2019s net revenues in fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021. The remainder of the Company\u2019s sales are to customers that are serviced by its sales personnel. \nThe loss or reduction of product sales \nmade through third party sales representative organizations\n could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. \nFinding replacement organizations and distributors could be a time consuming process during which the Company\u2019s revenues could be negatively impacted. \n\n\nThe Company primarily sells product to customers from its United States warehoused inventory, which is referred to as the \u201cDomestic Program\u201d. Under the Domestic Program, title for product typically passes at the time of shipment. The Company\u2019s direct import program (\u201cDirect Import Program\u201d) allows its customers to import and receive product directly from an export port in the country of manufacture outside the United States. Under the Direct Import Program, title for the Company\u2019s product passes to the customer in the country of origin when the product is shipped by the Company\u2019s subsidiary in China. Under both programs, the Company recognizes revenues at the time title passes to the customer as this is when the Company satisfies its performance obligation under the contracts with its customers. See Item\u00a07 \u2014 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d During fiscal 2022 approximately 9% of the Company\u2019s product sales were sold under the Direct Import Program. During fiscal 2021, less than 1% of the Company\u2019s product sales were sold under the Direct Import Program.\n\n\nThe Company also sells product through third party online marketplaces to broaden its brand reach. The Company\u2019s website serves as an additional sales channel for products, and provides search capability, detailed product information, online merchant availability, demo videos and downloadable product specification sheets. The Company expects sales through online marketplaces to continue to be a growth initiative for its business.\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\nThe Company has an integrated system to coordinate the purchasing, sales and distribution aspects of its operations. The Company receives orders from its major customers via electronic data interface, facsimile, telephone or mail. The Company does not have long-term contracts with any of its customers, but rather receives orders on an ongoing basis. Products imported by the Company for the Domestic Program, generally from factories in Asia, are shipped by ocean and/or inland freight and then stored in the Company\u2019s outsourced warehouse facilities for shipment to customers. The Company monitors its inventory levels and goods in transit through the use of an electronic inventory system. When a purchase order under the Domestic Program is received, it is filled from the Company\u2019s inventory and the warehoused product is labeled and prepared for outbound shipment to the customer by common, contract or small package carrier. The ability of management to correctly anticipate and provide for inventory requirements is essential to the successful operation of the Company\u2019s business.\n\n\nLicensing Activities \n\n\nThe Company is currently party to one license agreement with a third party licensee that allows the licensee to manufacture and/or sell various products bearing the Company\u2019s trademarks into defined geographic areas. Such activities have had a positive impact on operating results by generating income with minimal incremental costs and without any working capital requirements. The Company has engaged each of Leveraged Marketing Corporation of America (\u201cLMCA\u201d) and Global Licensing Services Pte Limited (\u201cGLSL\u201d) as an agent to assist in identifying and procuring licensing opportunities. The Company protects its brand through careful license and product selection and control processes. \n\n\nSee Item\u00a01A \u2014 \u201cRisk Factors \u2014 Business, Operational and Strategic Risks \u2014 \u201c\nThe failure to obtain new licensees and\n distribution relationships or to maintain relationships with its existing licensees and distributors could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues, earnings and business.\u201d\n\n\nDesign and Manufacturing \n\n\nThe Company\u2019s products are manufactured by original equipment manufacturers in accordance with the Company\u2019s specifications. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, 100% of the Company\u2019s product purchases consisted of finished goods from foreign manufacturers located in the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n\n\nThe Company\u2019s design team is responsible for product development and works closely with suppliers and determines the cosmetic and other features for new products. Accordingly, the exterior designs and operating features of the products reflect the Company\u2019s judgment, or that of its customers, of current styles and consumer preferences. \n\n\nThe following summarizes the Company\u2019s purchases from its major product suppliers that accounted for more than 10% of the Company\u2019s total product purchases in fiscal 2022 and 2021: \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nFiscal Year\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplier\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2022\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItoma\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n83\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n59\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMidea\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Total\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n99\n\n\n\n\n%*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* All other suppliers were less than 10%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company considers its relationships with its suppliers to be satisfactory and believes that, barring any unusual material or part shortages or economic, fiscal or monetary conditions, the Company could develop alternative suppliers.

If its relationships with such suppliers terminate or are otherwise impaired, the Company would likely experience increased costs, disruptions in the manufacture and shipment of its products and a material loss of net sales\u201d and Item\u00a07 \u2014 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d.) \n\n\nWarranties \n\n\nThe Company offers limited warranties for its consumer electronics, comparable to those offered to consumers by the Company\u2019s competitors in the United States. Such warranties typically consist of a one year period for microwaves and a 90 day period for audio products, under which the Company pays for labor and parts, or offers a new or similar unit in exchange for a non-performing unit. \n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\nReturned Products \n\n\nThe Company\u2019s customers return product for a variety of reasons, including: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nretailer return policies which allow customer returns for no reason concerning the quality of the product itself; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ndamage to goods in transit and cosmetic imperfections; and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nmechanical failures. \n\n\nTrademarks \n\n\nThe Company owns the following principal trademarks for certain consumer electronic products in the United States, Canada, Mexico and various other countries: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nEmerson\n\u00ae\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nEmerson Research\n\u00ae\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nH.H.

The Company intends to renew all trademarks necessary for the conduct of its business. The Company considers the Emerson\n\u00ae\n trademark to be of material importance to its business and, to a lesser degree, the remaining trademarks. The Company licenses the Emerson\n\u00ae\n and certain of its other trademarks to third parties, the scope of which is on a limited product and geographic basis and for a period of time. See \u201cLicensing Activities.\u201d \n\n\nCompetition \n\n\nThe Company primarily competes in the low-to-medium-priced sector of the housewares and consumer electronics market. Management estimates that the Company has several dozen competitors that are manufacturers and/or distributors, many of which are much larger and have greater financial resources than the Company. The Company competes primarily on the basis of: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nbrand recognition; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nreliability; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nquality; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nprice; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ndesign; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nconsumer acceptance of the Company\u2019s products; and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe quality of service and support provided to retailers and their customers. \n\n\nThe Company also competes at the retail level for shelf space and promotional displays, all of which have an impact on its success in established and proposed distribution channels. \n\n\nGovernment Regulation \n\n\nPursuant to the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, the Trade Act of 1974 and regulations promulgated there under, the United States government charges tariff duties, excess charges, assessments and penalties on many imports. These regulations are subject to continuous change and revision by government agencies and by action of the United States Trade Representative. As all of the Company\u2019s products are currently manufactured by suppliers in China, the enactment of new legislation or the administration of current international trade regulations or executive action affecting trade agreements, changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements or changes in sourcing patterns could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations. See Item 1A \u2014 \u201cRisk Factors \u2014 Legal, Regulatory and Tax Risks \u2014 Foreign regulations and changes in trade policies and the \n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\npolitical, social and economic conditions in the United States and the foreign countries in which the Company operates its business could affect the Company\u2019s revenues and earnings materially and adversely\u201d\n and Item 1A \u2014 \u201cRisk Factors \u2014 \nLegal, Regulatory and Tax\n Risks \u2014 Tariffs or other restrictions placed on the Company\u2019s products imported into the United States from China, or any related countermeasures taken by China, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, profitability and results of operations.\u201d \n A number of states have adopted statutes regulating the manner of determining the amount of payments to independent service centers performing warranty service on products such as those sold by the Company. Additional Federal legislation and regulations regarding the importation of consumer electronics products, including the products marketed by the Company, have been proposed from time to time and, if enacted into law, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. \n\n\nProduct Liability and Insurance \n\n\nBecause of the nature of the products it sells, the Company is periodically subject to product liability claims resulting from personal injuries. The Company may also become involved in various lawsuits incidental to its business. \n\n\nAlthough the Company maintains product liability insurance coverage, there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s coverage limits will be sufficient to cover any successful product liability claims made against it in the future. In management\u2019s opinion, any ultimate liability arising out of currently pending product liability claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations. However, any claims substantially in excess of the Company\u2019s insurance coverage, or any substantial claim not covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. \n\n\nEmployees \n\n\nAs of June 14, 2022, the Company had 22 employees, comprised of 10 in the United States and 12 in China. None of the Company\u2019s employees are represented by unions, and the Company believes its labor relations are good. \n\n\nAvailable Information\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s corporate website is located at www.emersonradio.com. The Company files reports and other information with the SEC pursuant to the information requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). The Company makes available free of charge, on or through its website, the Company\u2019s annual, quarterly and current reports, and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing such reports with the SEC. Information contained on the Company\u2019s website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other report filed with the SEC. Readers may also read and copy any document the Company files at the SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov. \n\n", "item1a": ">Item\u00a01A.\n \nRISK FACTORS\n \n\n\nThe reader should carefully consider these risk factors in addition to those set forth in the Company\u2019s financial statements or the notes thereto. Additional risks about which the Company is not yet aware or that the Company currently believes to be immaterial also may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business operations. If any of the following occur, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or operating results may be adversely affected. In that case, the price of the Company\u2019s common stock may decline. \n\n\nBusiness, Operational and Strategic Risks \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s business has been and is expected to continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company continues to monitor the effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of its operations and regions, including the effect on its consumers, employees, trade customers, suppliers and distribution channels. The pandemic has created significant business disruption and economic uncertainty, which has affected the Company\u2019s supply chain, distribution channels and consumer demand for its products, and has directly and indirectly affected the Company\u2019s business and operating results. However, the full extent of its impact will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including the scope of any new virus mutations and outbreaks, the breadth and duration of any future business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, consumer confidence and the success of business and economic recovery as the pandemic recedes. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or any other health epidemic, is highly uncertain and subject to change not only with the spread of the disease, but also with the scope and timing of governmental, regulatory, fiscal, monetary and public health responses.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n Surges in demand related to COVID-19, as well as other factors, have continued to strain the global supply chain network, which has resulted in carrier-imposed capacity restrictions, carrier delays, and longer lead times. Demand for Chinese imports has caused shipment receiving and unloading backlogs at many U.S. ports that have been unable to keep pace with unprecedented inbound \n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\ncontainer volume. The situation has been further exacerbated by COVID-19 illness and protocols at many port locations. For example, the Company\u2019s supply chain has been and may in the future be adversely affected with production delays, service disruptions or limited manufacturing volumes associated with shutdowns of factories, logistics providers and shippers or reduced numbers of workers or working hours in the respective facilities, limits on component supplies and diminished capability to implement engineering and design changes in a timely manner. In addition, \nthe Company has experienced an increase in its freight costs \nas a result of the pandemic\n. Further, if\n the COVID-19 pandemic continues and the Company\u2019s operations continue to be adversely affected, the Company risks a delay, default, violation and/or non-compliance under existing agreements. Many of these effects may not be covered by the Company\u2019s existing insurance coverages.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe spread of COVID-19, which has caused a broad impact globally, has had and may continue to have a material economic effect on the Company\u2019s business. For example, the pandemic and related measures taken to limit the spread of disease has resulted in retail store closures, both temporary and permanent, higher unemployment and greater economic uncertainty, which have and may continue to adversely affect consumer purchasing behavior. Consumer spending generally may also be negatively affected by general macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence, including the effects of the current recession, resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. This may negatively affect sales of the Company\u2019s products at retail stores and online marketplace channels and through the Company\u2019s licensing agreements. Any significant reduction in consumer visits to, or spending at, retail stores, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and any decreased spending at retail stores or online caused by decreased consumer confidence and spending following the pandemic, may result in a loss of sales of the Company\u2019s products and profits and other material adverse effects.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhile the potential economic effects and the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, it has already caused, and is likely to result in further, significant disruption of global financial markets. In addition, the current recession has, and a depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and the market value of its common stock. The Company does not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on its business, its industry or the global economy as a whole, and the Company cannot predict the effects that COVID-19 pandemic-related business disruptions and economic uncertainty will have on its customers, suppliers, consumers, and each of their financial conditions. However, any material effect on these parties could further adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, notwithstanding ongoing efforts to manage COVID-19, including increased testing, widespread vaccination of the public and treatment of those who have contracted COVID-19, it is unclear when or whether progress in any of those areas will translate into an economic recovery that will restore consumer confidence and accelerate consumer spending. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed below in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial condition. Accordingly, given that the potential of these effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s operations has been and will likely continue to be material, the Company will continue to monitor the situation closely.\n\n\nThe Company relies on a small number of key customers for the majority of its business, and the loss or significant reduction in business with any of these key customers would materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and earnings.\n \n\n\nCertain customers have historically made up a significant percentage of the Company\u2019s product sales and net revenues. For fiscal 2022, Walmart, Amazon.com and Fred Meyer accounted for approximately 45%, 32% and 13%, respectively, of the Company\u2019s net revenues. For fiscal 2021, Walmart, Amazon.com and Fred Meyer accounted for approximately 37%, 33% and 11%, respectively, of the Company\u2019s net revenues. The Company expects that its online marketplaces will increasingly represent a significant portion of the Company\u2019s product sales going forward. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company\u2019s net revenues during these periods. All customer purchases are made through purchase orders and the Company does not have any long-term contracts with its customers. Accordingly, sales from customers that have accounted for a significant portion of the Company\u2019s net product sales and net revenues in past periods, individually or as a group, may not continue in future periods, or if continued, may not reach or exceed historical levels in any period, which has happened in the past and could happen in the future. Some of the Company\u2019s key customers may also experience economic difficulties or otherwise default on their obligations to the Company. The complete loss of, or significant reduction in business from, or a material adverse change in the financial condition of, any of the Company\u2019s key customers would cause a material and adverse change in the Company\u2019s revenues and operating results.\n\n\nThe Company is dependent on a limited number of products for its sales.\n \n\n\nThe Company derives a substantial portion of its product revenues from a limited number of\u00a0products, and the Company expects these\u00a0products\u00a0to continue to account for a large percentage of its product revenues in the near term. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2022, the Company\u2019s gross product sales were comprised principally of two product types within two categories \u2014 housewares products and audio products. Microwave ovens, which product type is within the housewares category, generated approximately 21% of the Company\u2019s gross product sales. Audio products generated approximately 79% of the Company\u2019s gross product sales during fiscal 2022. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, the Company\u2019s gross product sales were comprised principally of the same two product types within the same two categories \u2014 housewares products and audio products. Microwave ovens, which product type is within the housewares category, generated approximately 35% of the Company\u2019s gross product sales. \n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\nAudio products generated approximately 63% of the Company\u2019s gross product sales during fiscal 2021. Because the market for these product types and categories is characterized by periodic new product introductions, the Company\u2019s future financial performance will depend, in part, on the successful and timely development and customer acceptance of new and enhanced versions of these product types and other products distributed by the Company. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be successful in marketing these product types within these categories or any other new or enhanced products. For example, certain of the Company\u2019s key customers perform periodic line reviews to assess their product offerings, which have in the past and may in the future lead to loss of business and pricing pressures. As a result of this dependence, a significant decline in pricing of, or market acceptance of these product types and categories, either in general or specifically as marketed by the Company, would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operation. \n\n\nThe loss or reduction of business of one or a combination of its houseware and audio\u00a0product lines\u00a0could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\nIf the Company\u2019s third party sales representatives fail to adequately promote, market and sell the Company\u2019s products, the Company\u2019s revenues could significantly decrease. \n\n\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s product sales are made through third party sales representative organizations, whose members are not employees of the Company. The Company\u2019s level of sales depends on the effectiveness of these organizations, as well as the effectiveness of its own employees. Some of these third party representatives may sell (and do sell), with the Company\u2019s permission, competitive products of third parties as well as the Company\u2019s products. During fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, these organizations were responsible for approximately 50% and 87%, respectively, of the Company\u2019s net revenues. In addition, in fiscal 2022 one of these representative organizations was responsible for approximately 47% of the Company\u2019s net revenues and in fiscal 2021 one of these representative organizations was responsible for approximately 49% and another was responsible for approximately 30% of the Company\u2019s net revenues. If any of the Company\u2019s third party sales representative organizations engaged by the Company, especially the Company\u2019s largest, fails to adequately promote, market and sell its products, the Company\u2019s revenues could be significantly decreased until a replacement organization or distributor could be retained by the Company, which has happened in the past and could happen in the future.\n\u00a0The loss or reduction of product sales \nmade through third party sales representative organizations\n could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. \nFinding replacement organizations and distributors could be a time consuming process during which the Company\u2019s revenues could be negatively impacted. \n\n\nThe concentration of product sales among a limited number of retailers and the trend toward private label brands could materially reduce \nthe Company\u2019s \nrevenues and profitability.\n\n\nWith the concentration of the Company\u2019s product sales among a limited number of retailers, the Company is dependent upon a small number of customers whose bargaining strength is growing. These retailers generally purchase a limited selection of \nhouseware and consumer electronics products\n. As a result, there is significant competition for retail shelf space. In addition, certain of the Company\u2019s key customers use their own private label brands that compete directly with some of the Company\u2019s products. As the retailers in the \nhouseware and consumer electronics\n industry become more concentrated, competition for sales to these retailers may increase, which could materially reduce the Company's revenues and profitability.\n\n\nThe houseware and consumer electronics industry is consolidating, which could reduce the Company\u2019s ability to successfully secure product placements at key customers and limit its ability to sustain a cost competitive position in the industry.\n\n\nOver the past several years, the houseware and consumer electronics industry has undergone substantial consolidation, and further consolidation is likely. As a result of this consolidation, the \nhouseware and consumer electronics\n industry primarily consists of a limited number of large retailers and distributors. The Company\u2019s ability to gain or maintain its market share or maintain or enhance its relationships with key customers may be limited as a result of actions by competitors or the retailers\u2019 increasing use of private label brands.\n\n\nThe failure to obtain new licensees and distribution relationships or to \nmaintain relationships with its existing licensees and distributors could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues, earnings and business\n.\n\n\nThe Company maintains agreements that allow licensees to use the Company\u2019s trademarks for the manufacture and sale of specific consumer electronics and other products into defined geographic areas. These agreements typically are for a limited period of time and, upon expiration, the Company cannot assure that its agreements with its licensees will be renewed in the future or that the Company\u2019s relationships with its licensees or distributors will be maintained on satisfactory terms or at all.\n\u00a0Although the Company has engaged each of LMCA \nand GLSL \nas an agent to assist the Company in identifying and procuring licensing opportunities, there can be no assurance that the Company will find and secure suitable licensees\n \nor distribution relationships. \nIf the Company is unable to maintain its relationships with its licensees and distributors on terms satisfactory to the Company, or if it fails to obtain new licensees \n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\nor distribution relationships or the Company\u2019s licensees fail to protect the integrity and reputation of the Company\u2019s trademarks, \nthe value of the Emerson brand and\n the Company\u2019s licensing revenues and earnings could be materially and adversely affected. \n\n\nThe Company depends on a limited number of suppliers for its products. If its relationships with such suppliers terminate or are otherwise impaired, the Company would likely experience increased costs, disruptions in the manufacture and shipment of its products and a material loss of net sales.\n \n\n\nAlthough there are multiple potential suppliers for each of the Company\u2019s products, the Company relies and is dependent on a limited number of suppliers for its main products, all of which are located outside of the United States. \n\n\nThe Company does not have any long-term or exclusive purchase commitments with any of its suppliers. Itoma was the Company\u2019s largest supplier and accounted for approximately 83% and 59% of the Company\u2019s purchases of products during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. The Company\u2019s failure to maintain existing relationships with its suppliers or to establish new relationships on similar pricing and credit terms in the future could negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain products in a timely manner. If the Company is unable to obtain an ample supply of product from its existing suppliers or secure alternative sources of supply, it may be unable to satisfy its customers\u2019 orders, which could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and relationships with its customers. Finding replacement suppliers could be a time consuming process during which the Company\u2019s revenues and liquidity could be negatively impacted.\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s products use raw materials and components that may be subject to price fluctuations, shortages or interruptions of supply, and if the Company is unable to maintain supply sources for such raw materials and components, or if such sources fail to satisfy the Company\u2019s supply requirements, the Company may experience a loss of sales, increased component costs and reduced profitability. \n\n\nFactors that are largely beyond the Company\u2019s control, such as the cost, quality and availability of the raw materials and components needed by suppliers of the Company\u2019s products, may affect the cost of such products, and the Company may not be able to pass those costs on to its customers. The Company\u2019s products use raw materials and components that have been and may continue to be subject to price surges, shortages or interruptions of supply, including semiconductor chips that have been subject to an ongoing significant shortage. The cost, quality and availability of these components are essential to the successful production and sale of the Company\u2019s products.\n \nIf the Company is unable to maintain supply sources of these raw materials and components, or if such sources fail to satisfy the Company\u2019s supply requirements, the Company may lose sales and experience increased component costs. In particular, the Company utilizes semiconductor chips in its housewares products and audio products. Because semiconductor chips have been recently subject to an ongoing significant shortage, the Company\u2019s ability to source these important components that use semiconductor chips has been adversely affected. These supply interruptions have resulted in increased component delivery lead times, delays in product production and increased costs to obtain components with available semiconductor chips. To the extent this semiconductor chip shortage continues, the production ability of the Company\u2019s suppliers may continue to be impacted. Although the Company is seeking alternate sources of supply of these components, it may take several months to locate alternative suppliers or require the re-tooling of products to accommodate components from different suppliers. If the Company or its suppliers are unable to obtain components from third parties in the quantities and of the quality that the Company requires, on a timely basis and at acceptable prices, the Company may not be able to deliver its products on a timely or cost-effective basis to its customers, which could cause customers to terminate their contracts with the Company, reduce the Company\u2019s gross margins and seriously harm its business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\n\nIf the Company is unable to deliver products in the required amounts and in a timely fashion, the Company could experience delays or reductions in shipments to its customers, which could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and relationships with its customers.\n \n\n\nThe Company\u2019s ability to provide high quality customer service, process and fulfill orders, and manage inventory depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation and timely and uninterrupted performance of its suppliers. The Company can provide no assurances that it will not experience operational difficulties with its suppliers, including reductions in the availability of production capacity, errors in complying with product specifications, insufficient quality control, failures to meet production deadlines, increases in manufacturing costs, increased lead times or production shutdowns or production slowdowns due to social distancing guidelines or issues with absenteeism related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which have and could in the future result in increased costs and decreased efficiency. If the Company is unable to obtain products from these factories in the required quantities and quality and in a timely fashion, the Company could experience delays or reductions in product shipments to its customers, which could negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to meet the requirements of its customers, as well as its relationships with its customers, which in turn could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and operating results. In addition, shipping rates and surcharges are volatile and subject to market fluctuations, and any increases in shipping costs may reduce the Company\u2019s margins and adversely affect its profitability.\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\nAll the Company\u2019s suppliers are based in China and as a result the Company is subject to risks associated with international operations and global manufacturing and sourcing including, among others: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ncurrency fluctuations; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nlabor disputes and union actions that can disrupt the Company\u2019s ability to ship products to customers; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\npotential political, economic and social instability; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\npublic health threats, including the COVID-19 pandemic, inclement weather and natural disasters; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\npossible acts of terrorism; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nrestrictions on transfers of funds; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nchanges in import and export duties and quotas; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nchanges in domestic and international customs and tariffs; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nuncertainties involving the costs to transport products; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ndisruptions in the global transportation network, including port backlogs and availability of shipping containers; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nunexpected changes in regulatory environments; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nregulatory issues involved in dealing with foreign suppliers and in exporting and importing products; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nprotection of intellectual property; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ndifficulty in complying with a variety of foreign laws; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ndifficulty in obtaining distribution and support; and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\npotentially adverse tax consequences. \n\n\nFurthermore, any material disruption, slowdown or shutdown of the operations of the Company\u2019s principal logistics providers and shippers, including without limitation as a result of labor disputes, public health threats (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), social unrest, inclement weather, natural disasters, possible acts of terrorism, availability of shipping containers and increased security restrictions, could cause delays in the Company\u2019s ability to receive, process and fulfill customer orders and may cause orders to be canceled, lost or delivered late, goods to be returned or receipt of goods to be refused. These and other factors described above have and could continue to cause increases in shipping and storage costs. As a result, the Company\u2019s relationships with its customers, revenues and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. \n\n\nThe Company relies on a third-party logistics provider for the storage and distribution of its products in the United States and, if such third party logistics provider incurs any damage to the facilities where the Company\u2019s products are stored or is unable to distribute its products as needed, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and business. \n\n\nThe Company relies on a third-party logistics provider for the storage and distribution of its products. The facilities where the Company\u2019s products are stored by such provider may also be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including earthquakes, power outages, communications failure or terrorism. Any material damage to the facilities where the Company\u2019s products are stored could adversely affect its inventory and the ability of such third-party logistics provider to meet the needs of its customers. In addition, an inability to maintain the Company\u2019s contracts with such third-party logistics provider or a delay, disruption or quality control problems in the operations of such third-party logistics provider, including as a result of damage to the facilities of such provider or a strike by such provider\u2019s workers, could cause delays in the Company\u2019s ability to fulfill customer orders and may cause orders to be canceled, lost or delivered late, the Company\u2019s products to be returned or receipt of products to be refused, any of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. The Company\u2019s contract with its third-party logistics provider is terminable upon written notice by either party for convenience without cause. If the Company is unable to maintain its contract with its third-party logistics provider, the Company would be required to retain a new third party logistics provider and the Company may be unable to retain such third party at a cost that is acceptable to the Company. If the Company\u2019s shipping costs were to increase as a result of an increase in the fees charged by such third-party logistics provider or as a result of obtaining a new third-party logistics provider and if the Company is unable to pass on these higher costs to its customers, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and business. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s revenues and earnings could be materially and adversely affected if it cannot anticipate market trends, enhance existing products or achieve market acceptance of new products.\n \n\n\nThe Company\u2019s success is dependent on its ability to anticipate and respond to changing consumer demands and trends in a timely manner, as well as expanding into new markets and sourcing new products that are profitable to the Company. In addition, to increase the Company\u2019s penetration of current markets and gain footholds in new markets for its products, the Company must maintain its existing products and integrate them with new products. The Company may not be successful in sourcing, marketing and releasing new products that respond to technological developments or changing customer needs and preferences. The Company may also experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and sale of these new products. These new products may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and may not achieve any significant degree of market acceptance. If release dates of any future products or enhancements to the Company\u2019s products are delayed, or if these products or enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance when released, the Company\u2019s sales volume may decline and earnings could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, new products or enhancements by the Company\u2019s competitors may cause customers to defer or forgo purchases of the Company\u2019s products, which could also materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and earnings. \n\n\nCash generated by operating activities represents the Company\u2019s principal source of funding and therefore the Company depends on its ability to successfully manage its operating cash flows to fund its operations.\n \n\n\nThe Company does not maintain any credit facilities (other than, from time to time, certain letters of credit) in connection with the operation of its business. The Company has relied on, and continues to rely on, its cash on hand and cash generated by operations to manage its business.\n \nCertain of the Company\u2019s major factory suppliers, including Itoma, extend credit lines to the Company in amounts based on various factors, including the amounts of the Company\u2019s purchases and their internal credit criteria, and in the past have reduced the maximum amount of open credit lines available to the Company. The loss of, or reduction in, credit lines from the Company\u2019s principal suppliers could reduce the Company\u2019s liquidity, increase its working capital needs or limit its ability to purchase products which in turn could adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, the Company may need to secure alternative means of financing or reorganize its operations to continue to maintain its current business.\n\n\nThe Company is subject to intense competition in the industry in which it operates, which could cause material changes in the selling price of its products or losses of its market share. \n\n\nThe housewares and consumer electronics industry is highly competitive, especially with respect to pricing and the introduction of new products and features. The Company\u2019s products compete in the low to medium-priced sector of the housewares and consumer electronics market and compete primarily on the basis of reliability, brand recognition, quality, price, design, consumer acceptance of the Emerson\n\u00ae\n trademark and quality service and support to retailers and its customers. The Company and many of its competitors are subject to factory cost increases, and the Company expects these pressures to continue. If these pressures are not mitigated by increases in selling price or cost reductions from the Company\u2019s suppliers or changes in product mix, or if the consumers of the Company\u2019s products change their buying habits as a result of the Company\u2019s actions, the Company\u2019s revenues and profits could be substantially reduced. In addition, the Company\u2019s expanded marketing plan includes sales through online marketplaces, including Amazon.com, and the success of this plan depends on the Company\u2019s ability to increase its visibility and continue to distribute its products through these online marketplaces. As compared to the Company, many of its competitors have significantly greater managerial, financial, marketing, technical and other competitive resources and greater brand recognition. As a result, the Company\u2019s competitors may be able to (i)\u00a0adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements; (ii) rapidly replicate new features and innovations that we may introduce into the market; (iii)\u00a0devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services; and (iv)\u00a0respond more effectively to pricing pressures. Competition could increase if new companies enter the market, existing competitors expand their product mix or the Company expands into new markets. An increase in competition could result in material price reductions or loss of the Company\u2019s market share. \n\n\nIn addition,\n the industry in which the Company competes generally has low barriers to entry that allow the introduction of new products or new competitors at a fast pace. Some retailers have and may continue to introduce their own private label products, which could reduce the volume of products they buy from the Company, as well as decrease the shelf space they allocate to the Company\u2019s products. If the Company is unable to protect the Company\u2019s brand image and authenticity, the Company may be unable to effectively\n compete\n with these new market entrants or new products\n. \n\n\nThe Company depends on the experience and expertise of its senior management team and key technical employees, and the loss of any key employee may impair its ability to operate effectively.\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s success depends upon the continued services of its senior management team and key technical employees. Each of the Company\u2019s executive officers, key technical personnel and other employees could terminate his or her relationship with the \n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\nCompany at any time. The loss of any member of the Company\u2019s senior management team might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of the Company\u2019s business objectives and could materially harm the Company\u2019s business and customer relationships. In addition, turnover, particularly on the senior management team, with insufficient development of leadership talent and succession plans, could diminish employee confidence and increase risks for retaining key employees.\n\n\nChanges in consumer spending and economic conditions may cause the Company\u2019s operating results to fluctuate and cause its stock price to decline. \n\n\nThe Company\u2019s net revenue and operating results may vary significantly from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter as well as in comparison to the corresponding quarter of the preceding year. Factors that may cause these variations include: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nchanges in market and economic conditions; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe discretionary nature of consumers\u2019 demands and spending patterns; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nvariations in the sales of the Company\u2019s products to its significant customers; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nvariations in manufacturing and supplier relationships; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nif the Company is unable to correctly anticipate and provide for inventory requirements, it may not have sufficient inventory to deliver its products to its customers in a timely fashion or the Company may have excess inventory that it is unable to sell; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nnew product developments or introductions; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nproduct reviews and other media coverage; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ncompetition, including competitive price pressures; and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\npolitical instability, war (including the current conflict in Ukraine), acts of terrorism, public health threats, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or other disasters. \n\n\nAs a result of any of these factors, the Company\u2019s operating results may fluctuate significantly, which may in turn cause its stock price to decline.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLegal, Regulatory and Tax Risks\n\n\nThe Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that are central to the Company\u2019s business; its failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm the Company\u2019s business or operating results.\n\n\nThe Company is or may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to its business, including laws and regulations regarding consumer protection, advertising, electronic commerce, intellectual property, manufacturing, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, and economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions.\n\n\nThe increasingly global nature of the Company\u2019s business operations subjects the Company to domestic and foreign laws and regulations such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions. The Company\u2019s products are also subject to U.S. export controls, including the United States Department of Commerce\u2019s Export Administration Regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. The Company is also subject to a variety of laws and regulations regarding information security and privacy. For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, impose significant requirements on how the Company collects, processes and transfers personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. Compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes.\n\n\nForeign regulations and changes in trade policies and the political, social and economic conditions in the United States and the foreign countries in which the Company operates its business could affect the Company\u2019s revenues and earnings materially and adversely.\n \n\n\nThe Company has operations in China and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sales of products manufactured by third parties located in China. In addition, third parties located in China and other countries located in the same region produce and supply many of the components and raw materials used in the Company\u2019s products. Additionally, a significant portion of the shipping of the Company\u2019s finished goods to the United States occurs through Hong Kong. Conducting an international business inherently \n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\ninvolves a number of difficulties and risks that could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to generate revenues and could subject the Company to increased costs. The diplomatic tensions between the United States and China, including over China\u2019s enactment of the Hong Kong national security law, create uncertainties for doing business in China, and the risk of additional protectionist trade policies and tariffs or other escalating retaliatory policies, such as the passage of the Hong Kong Autonomy Act in July 2020 and the concurrent U.S. executive order that ended the special economic status afforded to Hong Kong under the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, could increase the Company\u2019s cost of doing business and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the current U.S. administration will alter the existing trade agreements between China and the U.S. or otherwise modify or impose additional tariffs on imports from China. It is possible that further tariffs may be imposed on the categories of products the Company imports to the United States, or that the Company\u2019s business will be affected by retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response to existing or future tariffs, causing the Company to raise prices or make changes to its operations, any of which could adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s products or increase its costs.\n\n\nAmong the other factors that may adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and increase its costs are: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ncurrency fluctuations which could cause an increase in the price of the components and raw materials used in the Company\u2019s products and a decrease in its profits; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nChinese labor laws; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nlabor shortages affecting the Company\u2019s facilities and its suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facilities located in China; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe elimination or reduction of value-added tax refunds to Chinese factories that manufacture products for export; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe rise of inflation and substantial economic growth in China; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nmore stringent export restrictions in the countries in which the Company operates which could adversely affect its ability to deliver its products to its customers; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ntariffs and other trade barriers which could make it more expensive for the Company to obtain and deliver its products to its customers;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nincreases in shipping costs for the Company\u2019s products or other service issues with the Company\u2019s third-party shippers, such as global availability of shipping containers and fuel costs; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\npolitical instability and economic downturns in these countries which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain its products from its manufacturers or deliver its products to its customers in a timely fashion; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\noutbreaks of public health threats, such as COVID-19, influenza and other highly communicable diseases or viruses, affecting the production capabilities of the Company\u2019s suppliers, including as a result of quarantines or closures;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nnew restrictions on the sale of electronic products containing certain hazardous substances; and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe laws of China are likely to govern many of the Company\u2019s supplier agreements. \n\n\nAny of the factors described above may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and/or increase its operating expenses. \n\n\nTariffs or other restrictions placed on the Company\u2019s products imported into the United States from China, or any related countermeasures taken by China, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, profitability and results of operations.\n\n\n The Company has operations in China and all of the Company\u2019s products are currently manufactured by suppliers in China. Any tariffs or other trade restrictions affecting the import of these products to the United States from China or any retaliatory trade measures taken by China in response to existing or future tariffs could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations going forward. The Company\u2019s dependency on its overseas suppliers could exacerbate these and other risks, and any tariffs on the categories of products the Company imports to the United States could negatively affect the demand for such products, increase the cost of components, delay production or affect the Company\u2019s ability to compete against competitors who do not manufacture in China or otherwise are not subject to such tariffs.\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\nBeginning in 2018, the United States has imposed additional duties, ranging from 10% to 25%, on a variety of goods imported from China. Effective in September 2018, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (\u201cUSTR\u201d) imposed tariffs of 10% on approximately $200 billion worth of goods imported from China (\u201cList 3 products\u201d), including categories of products the Company imports from China and increased these tariffs to 25% effective in May 2019. In August 2019, the U.S. administration directed the USTR to increase tariffs on List 3 products from 25% to 30% effective October 2019, which increases were subsequently delayed indefinitely. In May 2019, the USTR proposed imposing additional tariffs of up to 25% on essentially all remaining Chinese-origin imports, including approximately $300 billion worth of goods imported from China (\u201cList 4 products\u201d). Tariffs of 15% were imposed on certain List 4 products effective in September 2019 (\u201cList 4A products\u201d), and the remainder were scheduled to be subject to these tariffs effective in December 2019 (\u201cList 4B products\u201d). In January 2020, the United States and China signed a Phase One Economic and Trade Agreement, pursuant to which the tariff increases on the List 4B products remained suspended and the rate of additional tariffs on the List 4A products was reduced to 7.5%, while all other tariffs remain in place. The effects on the Company of these imposed and proposed tariffs are uncertain because of the dynamic nature of governmental actions and responses, as well as possible exemptions for certain products. If the U.S. and China are able to negotiate the issues to restore a mutually advantageous and fair trading regime, the increased tariffs could be eliminated, but given the uncertainties, including as a result of the recent change in U.S. administrations and any other political changes, there can be no assurance of whether, or when, this will be accomplished. If the currently imposed and proposed tariffs covering the categories of products that the Company imports continue or are increased, and the Company is unable to obtain an exception, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\n\n\nAlthough the Company is monitoring the trade environment and working to mitigate the effects of tariffs through pricing and sourcing strategies, including through proactive management of inventory built up in advance of the recent tariff increases, and may take additional steps, the Company cannot be certain how its customers and competitors will react to the actions taken. Additional tariffs imposed by the United States, and any related countermeasures by China, including as a result of the heightened tensions between the United States and China over Hong Kong, could increase the Company\u2019s cost of goods and reduce its gross margins. If the Company determines to pass some or all of these new tariff burdens on to its customers as product price increases in the future, the result may be a degradation of the Company\u2019s competitive position and a loss of customers that would adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating performance. However, the ultimate outcome of these tariff actions is not clear at this time, and there can be no assurances that the Company\u2019s mitigation efforts will be successful or that the imposition of any such tariffs or trade actions would not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s revenue, gross margins and operating results.\n\n\nThe Company could be exposed to product liability or other claims for which its product liability or other insurance may be inadequate. \n\n\nA failure of any of the products marketed by the Company may subject it to the risk of product liability claims and litigation arising from injuries allegedly caused by the improper functioning or design of its products. Although the Company currently maintains product liability insurance in amounts which the Company considers adequate, the Company cannot assure that: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nits insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nadequate product liability insurance will continue to be available in the future; or \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nits insurance can be maintained on acceptable terms. \n\n\nTo the extent product liability or other litigation losses are beyond the limits or scope of the Company\u2019s insurance coverage, the Company\u2019s expenses could materially increase. \n\n\nThe Company\u2019s business could be materially and adversely affected if it cannot protect its intellectual property rights or if it infringes on the intellectual property rights of others.\n \n\n\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete effectively depends on its ability to maintain and protect its proprietary rights. The Company owns the Emerson\n\u00ae\n and other trademarks, which are materially important to its business, as well as other trademarks, licenses and proprietary rights that are used for certain of the products that it markets and sells. The Company\u2019s trademarks are registered throughout the world, including the United States and other countries. The laws of some foreign countries in which the Company operates may not protect the Company\u2019s proprietary rights to the same extent as do laws in the United States. The protections afforded by the laws of such countries may not be adequate to protect the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights. \n\n\nThird parties may seek to challenge, invalidate, circumvent or render unenforceable any trademarks, patents or proprietary rights owned by or licensed to the Company. In addition, in the event third-party licensees fail to protect the integrity of the Company\u2019s trademarks, the value of these marks could be materially and adversely affected. The Company\u2019s inability to protect its proprietary rights could materially and adversely affect the license of its trade names, trademarks and other proprietary rights to third parties as well as its ability to sell its products. Litigation has been and may in the future be necessary to enforce the Company\u2019s intellectual \n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\nproperty rights, protect the Company\u2019s trade secrets and determine the scope and validity of such intellectual property rights. Any such litigation, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management\u2019s attention from the operation of the Company\u2019s business. \n\n\nThe Company may receive notices of claims of infringement of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights. Such actions could result in litigation and the Company could incur significant costs and diversion of resources in defending such claims. The party making such claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief. Such relief could effectively block the Company\u2019s ability to make, use, sell, distribute or market its products and services in certain jurisdictions. The Company may also be required to seek licenses to such intellectual property. The Company cannot predict, however, whether such licenses would be available or, if available, that such licenses could be obtained on terms that are commercially reasonable and acceptable to the Company. The failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could delay or preclude the sale, manufacture or distribution of its products and could result in increased costs to the Company.\n\n\nAn information systems interruption or breach in security, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and reputation.\n\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company electronically maintains sensitive data, including intellectual property, its proprietary business information and that of its customers and suppliers, and some personally identifiable information of employees, in its facilities and on its networks. In addition, the Company sells its products through online marketplaces, including Amazon.com, which rely upon third-party online payment platform service providers that maintain personal information collected from customers. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is important to the Company\u2019s operations. A breach of the Company\u2019s security systems and procedures or those of its vendors could result in significant data losses or theft of the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 or the Company\u2019s employees\u2019 intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information.\u00a0 A cybersecurity breach could negatively affect the Company\u2019s reputation.\u00a0\n\n\nBecause the techniques \nsuch as viruses and worms, phishing attacks, distributed denial-of-service attacks, ransomware, \nused to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, hardware, software or applications the Company procures from third parties or uses in its online marketplaces may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to the Company\u2019s systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving its employees. Accordingly, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, or if such measures are implemented, and even with appropriate training conducted in support of such measures, human errors may still occur. It is virtually impossible for the Company to entirely mitigate this risk. A party, whether internal or external, who is able to circumvent the Company\u2019s security measures or those of its vendors could misappropriate information. \nIn addition, cyber insurance may not protect against all of the costs and liabilities arising from a cyber-attack.\n\n\nIf the Company or the online payment platforms it uses fail to reasonably maintain the security of confidential information, the Company may suffer significant reputational and financial losses and the Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and liquidity may be adversely affected. In addition, a system breach could result in other negative consequences, including disruption of internal operations, and may subject the Company to private litigation, government investigations, enforcement actions, and cause the Company to incur potentially significant liability, damages, or remediation costs.\n\n\nThe Company operates its business in jurisdictions where intellectual property theft or compromise is common.\n\n\nCurrently, a majority of the Company\u2019s products are manufactured in China. Subject to contractual confidentiality obligations, the Company is required to share significant product design materials with third-parties necessary for the design and manufacture of our products. The Company cannot be sure that its data or intellectual property will not be compromised through cyber-intrusion, theft or other means, particularly when the data or intellectual property is held by partners in foreign jurisdictions. Should the Company\u2019s intellectual property be compromised, it may be difficult to enforce the Company\u2019s rights in China and other foreign jurisdictions in which the Company operates.\n\n\nFluctuations in the Company\u2019s tax obligations and effective tax rate and realization of deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, may result in volatility of the Company\u2019s operating results.\n\n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in various U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. The Company records tax expense based on its estimates of future payments, which may include reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions, and valuation allowances related to certain net deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards. In addition, tax laws in certain jurisdictions may limit the ability to use net operating loss carryforwards upon a change in control. At any one time, many tax years may be subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may \n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\naffect the ultimate settlement of these issues. In addition, the Company\u2019s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially affected by a variety of factors including but not limited to changes in the mix and level of revenues, varying tax rates in the different jurisdictions in which the Company operates, fluctuations in the valuation allowance, timing of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards, or by changes to existing accounting rules or regulations. Further, tax legislation or changes in tax rules and regulations or the interpretations thereof, including but not limited to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, may be enacted in the future which could negatively affect the Company\u2019s current or future tax structure and effective tax rates.\n\n\nCorporate Governance and Stock Ownership Risks\n\n\nThere is a limited trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock and the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock is subject to volatility.\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s common stock, which trades on the NYSE American, has experienced, and may experience in the future, significant price and volume fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock. For example, the Company believes that recent volatility in the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock reflects market and trading dynamics unrelated to the Company\u2019s underlying business or macro or industry fundamentals. These fluctuations have been accompanied by reports of strong and atypical retail investor interest, including on social media and online forums. The Company may continue to incur rapid and substantial increases or decreases in its stock price that may not coincide in timing with the disclosure of news or developments by or affecting the Company. Accordingly, the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may fluctuate dramatically, and may decline rapidly, regardless of any developments in the Company\u2019s business. The market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to various factors and events, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe ongoing impacts and developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nactual or anticipated variations in operating results and cash flows;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nloss of a key customer, licensee or supplier;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nannouncements or events that affect the Company\u2019s products, customers, competitors or markets;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ngeneral business conditions in the markets and industry in which the Company competes;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe increase in the number of individual holders of the Company\u2019s common stock and their participation in social media platforms targeted at speculative investing; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe level of the Company\u2019s stock repurchase activity; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nconcentration of holdings of the Company\u2019s common stock; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nother events or factors, including those listed under this section entitled \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\n\n\nIn addition, the securities markets have recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies due to, among other factors, the actions of market participants or other actions outside of the Company\u2019s control, including general market volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, regulatory and market conditions, may negatively impact the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to securities class action litigation. The Company may be the target of this type of litigation in the future, which could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention.\n\n\nThe Company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE American rules and, as a result, qualifies for, and relies on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. As a result, the Company\u2019s shareholders do not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\n\n\nNimble Holdings Company Limited (\u201cNimble\u201d), formerly known as The Grande Holdings Limited, through one of its indirect subsidiaries, is the beneficial owner of approximately 72.4% of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock as of March 31, 2022. As a result, the Company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE American Company Guide. Under the NYSE American rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by another person or group of persons acting together is a controlled company and may elect not to comply with certain NYSE American corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\na majority of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors consist of independent directors;\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe Company has a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe Company has a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities.\n\n\nThe Company has elected to use certain of these exemptions and the Company may continue to use all or some of these exemptions in the future for so long as the Company is a controlled company. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors acts as the nominating committee and compensation committee and determines the compensation and benefits of the Company\u2019s executive officers, administers its employee stock and benefit plans, as may be in effect from time to time, and reviews policies relating to the compensation and benefits of its employees. Although all board members have fiduciary obligations in connection with compensation matters, the Company\u2019s lack of an independent compensation committee presents the risk that any executive officers who are also directors may have influence over their personal compensation and benefits levels that may not be commensurate with the Company\u2019s financial performance. Accordingly, shareholders of the Company do not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE American.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe controlling ownership of the Company\u2019s common stock by an indirect subsidiary of Nimble substantially reduces the influence of other stockholders, and the interests of Nimble may conflict with the interests of the Company\u2019s other stockholders.\n \n\n\nNimble, through one of its indirect subsidiaries, is the beneficial owner of approximately 72.4% of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock as of March 31, 2022. As a result, Nimble will be able to exert significant influence over the Company\u2019s business and have the ability to control the approval process for actions by the Company that require stockholder approval, including: the election of the Company\u2019s directors and the approval of mergers, sales of assets or other significant corporate transactions or matters submitted for stockholder approval. Nimble may have interests that differ from your interests and may cause the shares in the Company beneficially owned by Nimble to be voted in a way with which you disagree and that may be adverse to your interests. In addition, several provisions of the Company\u2019s organizational documents and Delaware law may deter or prevent a takeover attempt, including a takeover attempt in which the potential purchaser offers to pay a per share price greater than the current market price of the Company\u2019s common stock. Under the terms of the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation, its board of directors has the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for the Company\u2019s common stock, including transactions that may be in your best interests. \n\n\nThe Company\u2019s bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the federal district courts in Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by the Company\u2019s stockholders, which could limit stockholders\u2019 ability to have certain claims heard in any other judicial forum.\n\n\nPursuant to the Company\u2019s corporate bylaws, as amended (the \u201cbylaws\u201d), unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company; (ii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Company or any stockholder to the Company or the Company\u2019s stockholders; (iii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim against the Company or any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Company or any stockholder arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation or bylaws (as each may be amended from time to time); (iv) any action or proceeding to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation or bylaws (including any right, obligation or remedy thereunder); (v) any action or proceeding as to which the General Corporation Law of Delaware confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and (vi) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any director, officer or other employee of the Company or any stockholder, governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the court\u2019s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. This forum selection clause in the Company\u2019s bylaws does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act, or any other claim for which the federal courts of the United States of America have exclusive jurisdiction. The bylaws further provide, that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In addition, the bylaws provide that any person or entity holding, owning or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of capital stock of the Company shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to these provisions. The forum selection clause in the Company\u2019s bylaws may limit stockholders\u2019 ability to have certain claims heard in any court other than in the Court of Chancery or the federal district courts in Delaware.\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "item7": ">Item\u00a07.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \n\n\nThe following discussion of the Company\u2019s operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The Company\u2019s sales were highly concentrated among three customers - Walmart, Amazon.com and Fred Meyer, where gross product sales to these three customers were in the aggregate approximately 90.5% and 82.1% of the Company\u2019s total gross product sales in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. The increase in net product sales during fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by increased consumer demand for certain of the Company\u2019s products offered by these customers, in particular clock radios as consumers spent more time at home and shopped online, and the Company\u2019s and its core customers\u2019 ability to continue to sell products under difficult economic conditions, including \nthrough online channels\n. Net product sales may be periodically impacted by adjustments made to the Company\u2019s sales allowance and marketing support accrual to record unanticipated customer deductions from accounts receivable or to reduce the accrual by any amounts which were accrued in the past but not taken by customers through deductions from accounts receivable within a certain time period. In the aggregate, these adjustments had the effect of increasing net product sales and operating income by approximately nil and $53,000\u00a0for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. Net product sales are comprised primarily of the sales of houseware and audio products which bear the Emerson\n\u00ae\n brand name. The major elements which contributed to the overall increase in net product sales were as follows: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\ni)\n\n\n\n\nHouseware product net sales decreased $0.9 million, or 35.9%, to $1.7 million in fiscal 2022 as compared to $2.6 million in fiscal 2021, principally driven by a decrease in sales of microwave ovens and by a decrease in sales of toaster ovens. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nii)\n\n\n\n\nAudio product net sales were $6.3 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $4.6 million in fiscal 2021, an increase of $1.7 million, or 36.4%, resulting from increased net sales of clock radios. The Company benefitted from the introduction of new clock radios into the marketplace during fiscal 2022.\n\n\nBusiness operations\n \u2014 \nThe Company expects to continue to expand its existing distribution channels and to develop and promote new products with retailers in the U.S. The Company is also continuing to invest in products and marketing activities to expand its sales through internet and ecommerce channels. These efforts require investments in appropriate human resources, media marketing and development of products in various categories in addition to the traditional home appliances and audio products on which the Company has historically focused. The Company also is continuing its efforts to identify strategic courses of action related to its licensing activities, including seeking new licensing relationships. The Company has engaged each of LMCA and GLSL as an agent to assist in identifying and procuring potential licensees.\n\n\nEmerson\u2019s success is dependent on its ability to anticipate and respond to changing consumer demands and trends in a timely manner, as well as expanding into new markets and sourcing new products that are profitable to the Company. Geo-political factors may also affect the Company\u2019s operations and demand for the Company\u2019s products, which are subject to customs requirements and to tariffs and quotas set by governments through mutual agreements and bilateral actions. The Company expects that current and proposed U.S. tariffs on categories of products that the Company imports from China, and China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs on certain goods \n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\nimported from the United States, as well as modifications to international trade policy, will continue to affect its product costs going forward. If no mitigation steps are taken, or the mitigation is unsuccessful, the combination of tariffs will result in significantly increased annualized costs to the Company as all of the Company\u2019s products are currently manufactured by suppliers in China. Although the Company is monitoring the trade and political environment and working to mitigate the possible effect of tariffs with its suppliers as well as its customers through pricing and sourcing strategies, the Company cannot be certain how its customers and competitors will react to the actions taken. In addition, heightened tensions between the United States and China over Hong Kong and any resulting retaliatory policies may affect our operations in Hong Kong. At this time the Company is unable to quantify possible effects on its costs arising from the new tariffs, which are expected to increase the Company\u2019s inventory costs and associated costs of sales as tariffs are incurred, and some costs may be passed through to the Company\u2019s customers as product price increases in the future. However, if the Company is unable to successfully pass through the additional costs or otherwise mitigate the effects of these tariffs, or if the higher prices reduce demand for the Company\u2019s products, it will have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s product sales and gross margins.\n\n\nStarting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the global COVID-19 pandemic has presented significant challenges and impacted the Company\u2019s business and operating results, and the operations and production capabilities of the Company\u2019s suppliers in China and the distribution capabilities of the Company\u2019s third party logistics provider, including as a result of quarantine or closure. The pandemic has directly and indirectly disrupted certain sales and supply chain activities and affected the Company\u2019s ability to address those challenges. Although the Company has since experienced increased demand in certain of its product categories and favorable impacts on its online channels as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company expects that the pandemic will continue to impact its business and operations over the coming quarters, including with respect to the magnitude and timing of orders by retailers, resellers, distributors and consumers. Additionally, surges in demand and shifts in shopping patterns related to the COVID-19 pandemic have strained the global freight network and availability of shipping containers, which has been further exacerbated by COVID-19 outbreaks and protocols at many port locations, resulting in carrier-imposed capacity restrictions, carrier delays and longer lead times, including shipment receiving and unloading backlogs at many U.S. ports. As a result, the Company\u2019s shipping costs have recently increased by several multiples compared to fiscal 2021 averages. Global component shortages, in particular semiconductor chips, arising from these changes in consumer demand and reduced manufacturing capacity related to the COVID-19 pandemic have also caused and are likely to continue to result in significant price fluctuations and long lead times in the supply of these components. Although the Company is seeking alternate suppliers for these components, developing alternate sources of supply will be time consuming, difficult and costly, and may require the re-tooling of products to accommodate components from different suppliers. In addition to increasing cost trends, the Company\u2019s suppliers are not equipped to hold meaningful amounts of inventory and if shipping container capacity remains limited or unavailable, they could pause manufacturing, which could ultimately impact the Company\u2019s ability to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis. These impacts on the Company\u2019s supply chain have and may continue to impact the Company\u2019s ability to meet product demand, which could result in additional costs, customer dissatisfaction in the event of inventory shortages or may otherwise adversely impact the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\n\n\nIn light of the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on macroeconomic conditions domestically and internationally, along with the uncertainty associated with a potential recovery, the Company has implemented certain cost-reduction actions intended to reduce expenditures in light of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic to the business. However, the environment remains highly uncertain and demand for the Company\u2019s products remains difficult to assess due to many factors including the pace of economic recovery around the world, the status of various government stimulus programs, competitive intensity and retailer actions to continue carefully managing inventory. As a result, the Company is unable at this time to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its operations and financial results, and, depending on the magnitude and duration of the pandemic, including the further spread and severity of COVID-19 cases in areas in which the Company operates and the availability and distribution of effective vaccines, such impact may be material. Accordingly, current results and financial condition discussed herein may not be indicative of future operating results and trends\n.\n\n\nFor more information on risks associated with the Company\u2019s operations, including tariffs and the COVID-19 pandemic, please see the risk factors within Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\nRecent Developments \n\u2014 On April 19, 2022, the US District Court for the District of Delaware granted judgment in favor of the Company in its trademark infringement lawsuit against air conditioning and heating products provider Emerson Quiet Kool and wholesaler Home Easy (the \u201cdefendants\u201d). Among other things, the court order issues an injunction and directs the US Patent and Trademark Office to cancel the defendants\u2019 existing and proposed \u201cEmerson Quiet Kool\u201d trademarks and prohibits defendants from registering or applying to register the same mark or any other mark or name containing the word \u201cEmerson\u201d going forward. The judgment also awards $6.5 million to the Company\n.\n Like any judgment, there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to\u00a0collect\u00a0the\u00a0judgment or, if it is able to collect, how soon it will be able to do so. The Company is pursuing various post-judgment motions against defendants.\u00a0The defendants have filed a notice of appeal of the judgment.\n\n\nLicensing revenue\n \u2014 Licensing revenue in fiscal 2022 was approximately $265,000 as compared to $245,000 for fiscal 2021, an increase of $20,000, or 8.2%, which was driven primarily by the escalation of the annual minimum royalty of the Company\u2019s licensee.\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\nNet revenues\n \u2014The Company\u2019s net revenues were $8.2 million for fiscal 2022 as compared to $7.4 million for fiscal 2021, an increase of $0.8 million, or 10.2%, which was driven primarily by the increase in audio product net sales, offset by the decrease in houseware product net sales. \n\n\nCost of sales\n \u2014 Cost of sales includes the components described in Note 1 \n\u201cCost of Sales\u201d\n of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In absolute terms, cost of sales increased $0.6 million, or 11.8%, to $6.2 million in fiscal 2022 as compared to $5.7\u00a0million in fiscal 2021. The increase in absolute terms for fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily related to the improvement in net product sales partially offset by lower year-over-year gross cost of sales as a percentage of gross sales. The decrease in gross cost of sales as a percentage of gross sales for fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily related to the change in product mix as described above, partially offset by increased year-over-year shipping costs. \nThe amounts presented are based on the change in methodology regarding the Company\u2019s definition of Cost of Sales. See Note 1 \u201cSignificant Accounting Policies\u201d\n \nof the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (\u201cS,G&A\u201d)\n \u2014 S,G&A, as a percentage of net revenues, was 65.8% in fiscal 2022 as compared to 79.1% in fiscal 2021. Fiscal 2022 S,G&A, in absolute terms, was $5.4 million and in fiscal 2021 S,G&A, in absolute terms, was $5.9 million, an increase of $0.5 million, or 8.4%. \nThe decrease in S,G&A was primarily due to reduced legal fees of approximately $249,000 or 16.4%. Legal fees during fiscal 2022 were approximately $1,273,000 as compared to $1,522,000 during fiscal 2021. The majority of the decrease in legal fees concerned the protection of the Emerson\u00ae trademark. The Company also benefitted by reductions in compensation costs of $127,000 and commission fees of $52,000. \n\n\nLoss on settlement of litigation\n\u00a0\u2014 On January 3, 2022, a legal settlement was entered into between the Company and one of its former directors that resolved certain disputes, including certain claims against the former director and an indemnification claim made by the former director. The amount of the settlement was $450,000.\n\n\nInterest income, net\n \u2014 Interest income, net, was $57,000 in fiscal 2022 as compared to $151,000 in fiscal 2021, resulting from a decrease in interest rates earned on the Company\u2019s short term investments during fiscal 2022. \n\n\nIncome from governmental assistance programs\u00a0\n\u2014 During fiscal 2022, the Company\u00a0recorded income of approximately $207,000, related to its \nPaycheck Protection Program (\u201c\nPPP\u201d) loan forgiveness. During fiscal 2021, the Company recorded income of approximately $83,000, related to assistance received from the Hong Kong government under a similar program \ncalled the Employment Support Scheme\n. See \u201cNote 15 -\u00a0Paycheck Protection Program and Employment Support Scheme\u201d.\n\n\nProvision for income tax expense\n \n\u2014 The Company adopted ASU 2019-12 during fiscal 2022 and recorded its non-income based state taxes of approximately $11,000 to S,G&A. In order to conform fiscal 2021 to the current presentation, approximately $15,000 of non-income based state taxes were reclassified to S,G&A. In fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, the Company recorded a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets of approximately $844,000 and $615,000, respectively. See Note 5 \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\n\nNet (loss)\n \u2014 As a result of the foregoing factors, the Company recorded a net loss of $3.6 million for fiscal 2022 as compared to a net loss of $4.0 million for fiscal 2021. \n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\n\nGeneral \n\n\nAs of March 31, 2022, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $25.6 million as compared to approximately $5.2 million at March 31, 2021. Working capital decreased to $28.1 million at March 31, 2022 as compared to $32.1 million at March 31, 2021. The increase in cash and cash equivalents of approximately $20.4 million is set out in \u201cCash Flows\u201d below. \n\n\nCash Flows\n\n\nNet cash used by operating activities was approximately $4.7 million for fiscal 2022, compared to approximately $4.3 million for fiscal 2021, resulting from a $3.6 million loss generated during the period, a $0.6 million increase in accounts receivable, a $0.4 million increase in right of use assets, a $0.2 million decrease in income taxes payable, a $0.2 million increase in the Company\u2019s PPP loan forgiveness and a $0.2 million increase in inventory partially offset by a $0.2 million decrease in prepaid purchases, a $0.2 million increase in amortization of right-of-use assets and a $0.1 million increase in long term lease liabilities. \n\n\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $25.0 million for fiscal 2022, compared to $3.0 million for fiscal 2021, primarily due to a decrease of investments in short term deposits. \n\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was nil for fiscal 2022 for fiscal 2022, compared to $0.2 million for fiscal 2021. \n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\nCredit Arrangements \n\n\nLetters of Credit\n \n\u2014 The Company utilizes the services of one of its banks to issue secured letters of credit on behalf of the Company, as needed, on a 100% cash collateralized basis. At March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021, the Company had no letters of credit outstanding. \n\n\nShort-term Liquidity \n\n\nThe Company\u2019s principal existing sources of cash are generated from operations. The Company believes that its cash on hand and existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support its existing operations over the next 12 months. \n\n\nHistorically, a significant percentage of the Company\u2019s product sales were made under the Direct Import Program. The direct importation of product by the Company to its customers can significantly benefit the Company\u2019s liquidity because this inventory does not need to be financed by the Company. In fiscal 2022, approximately 9% of the Company\u2019s product sales were imported directly to the Company\u2019s customers. In fiscal 2021, less than 1% of the Company\u2019s product sales were imported directly to the Company\u2019s customers.\n\n\nAs of March 31, 2022, there were no capital expenditure or other commitments other than the normal purchase orders used to secure product.\n\n\nPaycheck Protection Program Loan\n\n\nIn April and May of 2020, the Company applied for and received aggregate PPP loan proceeds of approximately $204,000 under the PPP. The PPP loan accrued interest at 1% and matures two years from the date of issuance, with a deferral of payments for the first six months. \nThe Company used all of the PPP loan proceeds for qualifying expenses in accordance with terms of the \nCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security\n Act and applied for forgiveness of the loan to the extent applicable. On July 5, 2021, the Company\u2019s PPP loan was completely forgiven by the Small Business Administration.\n See Note 15 \u201cPaycheck Protection Program and Employment Support Scheme\u201d of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\n\nAs of March 31, 2022, the Company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n\nLegal Matters\n\n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records any potential gains related to legal proceedings only after cash is\u00a0collected. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.\u00a0See Note 11 in the \nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n.\n\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\n\nThe discussion and analysis of the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted within the United States. The preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management considers certain accounting policies related to inventories, trade accounts receivables, impairment of long-lived assets, valuation of deferred tax assets, sales return reserves and sales allowance accruals to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each. \n\n\nRevenue recognition\n:\n\u00a0Sales to customers and related cost of sales are primarily recognized at the point in time when control of goods transfers to the customer. Under the Direct Import Program, title passes in the country of origin. Under the Domestic Program, title passes primarily at the time of shipment. \nUnder both programs, the Company recognizes revenues at the time title passes to the customer as this is when the Company satisfies its performance obligation under the contracts with its customers. \nEstimates for future expected returns are based upon historical return rates and netted against revenues.\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\nRevenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods. Revenue is recorded net of customer discounts, promotional allowances, volume rebates and similar charges. When the Company offers the right to return product, historical experience is utilized to establish a liability for the estimate of expected returns. Sales and other tax amounts collected from customers for remittance to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue.\n\n\nThe Company adopted ASC topic 606 effective April 1, 2018. Sales allowances, marketing support programs, promotions and other volume-based incentives which are provided to retailers and distributors are accounted for on an accrual basis as a reduction to net revenues in the period in which the related sales are recognized. Prior to the adoption of ASC topic 606, the Company followed the provisions of ASC topic 605. The adoption of ASC topic 606 did not have a material impact on revenue recognition as compared to revenue recognition provided under ASC topic 605.\n\n\nIf additional marketing support programs, promotions and other volume-based incentives are required to promote the Company\u2019s products subsequent to the initial sale, then additional reserves may be required and are accrued for when such support is offered.\n \n\n\nInventory. \nInventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out basis and includes inventory purchase costs and allocated overhead. The Company records valuation adjustments for the excess cost of inventory over the estimated net realizable value. Valuation adjustments for slow-moving and obsolete inventory are calculated on an individual product basis based on physical inspection of the product in connection with a physical inventory, review of slow-moving products, forecasted sales, and consideration of active marketing programs. \n\n\nTrade Accounts Receivable.\n The Company extends credit based upon evaluations of a customer\u2019s financial condition and provides for any anticipated credit losses in the Company\u2019s financial statements based upon management\u2019s estimates and ongoing reviews of recorded allowances. If the financial condition of a customer deteriorates, resulting in an impairment of that customer\u2019s ability to make payments, additional reserves may be required. Conversely, reserves are reduced to reflect credit and collection improvements. \n\n\nIncome Taxes.\n The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce the amount of its deferred tax assets to the amount that management estimates is more likely than not to be realized. While management considers future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event that management determines that a deferred tax asset will likely be realized in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, if it is determined that all or part of a net deferred tax asset will likely not be realized in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.\n\n\nSales Return Reserves.\n Management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue. Management analyzes historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand for the Company\u2019s products when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for sales returns. Management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales return reserves in any accounting period. Additional reserves may be required if actual sales returns increase above the historical return rates. Conversely, the sales return reserve could be decreased if the actual return rates are less than the historical return rates, which were used to establish the reserve. \n\n\nSales Allowance and Marketing Support Accruals.\n Sales allowances, marketing support programs, promotions and other volume-based incentives which are provided to retailers and distributors are accounted for on an accrual basis as a reduction to net revenues in the period in which the related sales are recognized in accordance with ASC topic 606, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d. \n\n\nAt the time of sale, the Company reduces recognized gross revenue by allowances to cover, in addition to estimated sales returns as required by ASC topic 606, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d (i)\u00a0sales incentives offered to customers that meet the criteria for accrual and (ii)\u00a0an estimated amount to recognize additional non-offered deductions it anticipates and can reasonably estimate will be taken by customers, which it does not expect to recover. Accruals for the estimated amount of future non-offered deductions are required to be made as contra-revenue items, because that percentage of shipped revenue fails to meet the collectability criteria within ASC topic 606. \n\n\nIf additional marketing support programs, promotions and other volume-based incentives are required to promote the Company\u2019s products subsequent to the initial sale, then additional reserves may be required and are accrued for when such support is offered. \n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\n\n\nAccounting Standards Update 2019-12 \u201cIncome Taxes \n(Topic 740)\n \u2013 Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\u201d (Issued December 2019)\n\n\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, \u201cIncome Taxes (Topic 740) - Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes,\u201d which is intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. This standard is required to take effect in the Company\u2019s first quarter (June 2021) of the Company\u2019s fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. The impact of ASU 2019-12 on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements is limited. The Company is currently only subject to non-income based state taxes\n.\n\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n\n\n \nThe following ASUs were issued by the FASB which relate to or could relate to the Company as concerns the Company\u2019s normal ongoing operations or the industry in which the Company operates.\n\n\nAccounting Standards Update 2016-13 \u201cFinancial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses\u201d (Issued June 2016)\n\n\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 \u201cFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses\u201d to introduce new guidance for the accounting for credit losses on instruments within its scope. ASU 2016-13 requires among other things, the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable supportable forecasts. Many of the loss estimation techniques applied today will still be permitted, although the inputs to those techniques will change to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. In addition, ASU 2016-13 amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2022. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material impact on its financial statements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "item7a": ">Item\u00a07A.\n\n\n\n\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n \n\n\nNot applicable. \n\n\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "companyName": "EMERSON RADIO CORP", "cusip": "291011104"}
