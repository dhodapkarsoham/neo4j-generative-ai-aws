{"item1": ">Item 1. B\nusiness.\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\nGlobal Self Storage, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (\u201cREIT\u201d) that owns, operates, manages, acquires, and redevelops self storage properties (\u201cstores\u201d or \u201cproperties\u201d) in the United States. Our stores are designed to offer affordable, easily accessible, and secure storage space for residential and commercial customers. As of December 31, 2021, the Company owned and operated, or managed, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, thirteen stores located in Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Oklahoma. The Company was formerly registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d) as a non-diversified, closed end management investment company. The Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (\u201cSEC\u201d) order approving the Company\u2019s application to deregister from the 1940 Act was granted on January 19, 2016. On January 19, 2016, the Company changed its name to Global Self Storage, Inc. from Self Storage Group, Inc., changed its SEC registration from an investment company to an operating company reporting under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and listed its common stock on NASDAQ under the symbol \u201cSELF\u201d.\n\n\nThe Company was incorporated on December 12, 1996 under the laws of the state of Maryland. The Company has elected to be treated as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). To the extent the Company continues to qualify as a REIT, it will not generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax, with certain limited exceptions, on its taxable income that is distributed to its stockholders.\n\n\nBusiness Activities\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had 28 total employees and owned and operated, or managed, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, thirteen stores. As of December 31, 2021, these properties totaled 968,308 net leasable square feet and offered \u202d7,011\u202c storage units. In addition to traditional and climate-controlled units, many of the properties feature both covered and outside auto/RV/boat storage. The Company invests in stores by acquiring stores through its wholly owned subsidiaries and operates primarily in one segment: rental operations.\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\n\n\nWe continue to evaluate and enact a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to help enable us to maximize our stores\u2019 financial performance and stockholder value. Our strategies in seeking to maximize our stores\u2019 financial performance and stockholder value include, among others, the following:\n\n\n\u2022\ncontinue to implement and refine our move-in rate management systems in seeking to maximize occupancies and thus revenue derived from our store portfolio;\n\n\n\u2022\ncontinue to implement and refine our existing tenant revenue rate management systems in seeking to maximize revenue per leased square foot from our store portfolio;\n\n\n\u2022\ncontinue to implement and refine our digital, drive-by, and referral marketing programs in seeking to attract more and higher quality (e.g., credit card paying) customers to our stores at a lower net cost; and\n\n\n\u2022\ncontinue to pursue the acquisition of single stores and small portfolios that we believe can add stockholder value. \n\n\nOur stores are generally located in densely populated and high traffic areas near major roads and highways. All of our stores display prominent road signage and most feature LED marquee boards describing the store features and move-in rent specials. Our stores are generally located in areas with strict zoning laws and attentive planning boards which make it difficult for our competition to develop new properties near ours. As we evaluate potential stores for acquisition, we seek stores in areas with these high barriers to entry.\n\n\nMost of our stores compete with other well-managed and well-located competitors and we are subject to general economic conditions, particularly those that affect the spending habits of consumers and moving trends. Because we operate in competitive markets, often where self storage consumers have multiple stores from which to choose, such competition has affected and is likely to continue to affect our store results. We experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels as well, with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to\n \n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nincreased moving activity. We believe that our centralized information networks, national telephone and online reservation system, the brand name \u201cGlobal Self Storage,\u201d and our economies of scale help enable us to meet such challenges effectively.\n \n\n\nIn seeking to maximize the performance of our stores, we employ our proprietary revenue rate management systems which help us to analyze, adjust, and set our move-in and existing tenant rental rates on a real-time basis across our portfolio. Among other technologies, we employ internet data scraping of our local competitors\u2019 move-in rental rates to help enable us to proactively respond and take advantage of changing market conditions across our store portfolio. Our operating results typically depend significantly on our ability to manage our storage units\u2019 rental rates, to respond in a timely manner to prospective tenant inquiries, and to lease available storage units, and on the ability of our tenants to make required storage unit rental payments.\n\n\nWe have registered the trademark and developed the brand \u201cGlobal Self Storage.\u201d We have developed a corporate logo and have incorporated it on all of our on-site signage, advertising and other marketing materials. This branding process has included the creation and development of the www.GlobalSelfStorage.us website, whereby prospective customers can rent a storage unit or learn about the features of any of our self storage properties. We continue to develop the Global Self Storage internet presence through advertising and search engine optimization. We solicit tenant reviews for posting to the \u201cTestimonials\u201d section of our website and encourage others to view these reviews. We have found referrals of current tenants to be a reliable source of new tenants. Existing self storage customers may also pay their storage unit rent online through www.GlobalSelfStorage.us.\n\n\nAttracting high quality, long-term tenants is a top priority for the Company and we strongly believe in tenant quality over tenant quantity. In our marketing efforts, we have seen success in our referral marketing program, through which our tenants may recommend Global Self Storage to their family, friends, and colleagues. We also believe our store managers\u2019 attention to detail \u2013 maintaining security, cleanliness, and attentive customer service \u2013 is essential to attracting high quality tenants.\n\n\nTenant leases at all of our stores are \u201cmonth-to-month\u201d leases. We seek to deliver at least 30 days\u2019 written notice of any rental rate change. Lease rates at each store may be set monthly, semi-annually, annually, or at any other time on a case-by-case basis as determined in the discretion of management. Tenants may be assessed late, administrative, and/or other fees. To date, none of the Company\u2019s stores have experienced any material delinquencies.\n\n\nEach of our stores features a rental and payment center kiosk available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, where prospective tenants can rent a unit and current tenants can pay their rent. All of our stores have on-site property managers who are committed to delivering the finest customer service. We utilize a customer call center to handle telephone inquiries from current and prospective tenants whenever our store managers are not available. They can respond to questions about our properties and storage features, and book reservations. We seek to deliver convenience and high quality customer service to our tenants, as well as maintain clean and secure stores at all times.\n\n\nPlease refer to Item 7 herein for further discussion of, among other things, competitive business conditions, the Company\u2019s competitive position in the self storage industry, methods of competition, and the effect of existing or probable government regulations on the Company\u2019s business.\n \n\n\nOur Acquisition Strategy\n\n\nGeneral\n \n\n\nIn our store acquisition strategy, we will seek to continue to focus on secondary and tertiary cities in the Mid-West, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic parts of the country where we believe there is relatively less self storage space per capita available, generally resulting in greater demand for available self storage square feet; where new self storage development and permitting through the local planning and zoning boards is typically more difficult to secure thus creating barriers to entry for new self storage competition; and where local new supply through new development is generally less prevalent.\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe continue to review available acquisition opportunities with the awareness that, should interest rates rise, it may impact our ability to obtain favorable rates for financing acquisitions. We will seek to continue to employ our strict acquisition underwriting standards and remain a disciplined buyer and only execute acquisitions where we believe that our management techniques and innovations can strengthen our portfolio and increase stockholder value. For future acquisitions, the Company may continue to use various financing and capital raising alternatives including, but not limited to, debt and/or equity offerings, credit facilities, mortgage financing, and joint ventures with third parties.\n\n\nWe conduct or obtain environmental assessments in connection with the acquisition or development of additional stores. Whenever the environmental assessment for one of our stores indicates that a store is impacted by soil or groundwater contamination from prior owners/operators or other sources, we will work with environmental consultants and where appropriate, state governmental agencies, to ensure that the store is either cleaned up, that no cleanup is necessary because the low level of contamination poses no significant risk to public health or the environment, or that the responsibility for cleanup rests with a third party.\n \n\n\nWe continue to actively review a number of store and store portfolio acquisition opportunities and have been working to further develop and expand our current stores. We did not complete any self storage property acquisitions in 2021.\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nOur Financing Strategy\n\n\nOur financing strategy is to minimize the cost of our capital in order to maximize the returns generated for our stockholders.\n \n\n\nOn June 24, 2016, certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries (\u201cTerm Loan Secured Subsidiaries\u201d) entered into a loan agreement and certain other related agreements (collectively, the \u201cTerm Loan Agreement\u201d) between the Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries and Insurance Strategy Funding IV, LLC (the \u201cTerm Loan Lender\u201d). Under the Term Loan Agreement, the Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries borrowed from Term Loan Lender the principal amount of $20 million pursuant to a promissory note (the \u201cTerm Loan Promissory Note\u201d). The Term Loan Promissory Note bears interest at a rate equal to 4.192% per annum and is due to mature on July 1, 2036. Pursuant to a security agreement (the \u201cTerm Loan Security Agreement\u201d), the obligations under the Term Loan Agreement are secured by certain real estate assets owned by the Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries. J.P. Morgan Investment Management, Inc. acted as Special Purpose Vehicle Agent of the Term Loan Lender. We entered into a non-recourse guaranty (the \u201cTerm Loan Guaranty\u201d and together with the Term Loan Agreement, the Term Loan Promissory Note and the Term Loan Security Agreement, the \u201cTerm Loan Documents\u201d) on June 24, 2016 to guarantee the payment to the Term Loan Lender of certain obligations of the Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries under the Term Loan Agreement. We have used some of the proceeds from the Term Loan Agreement to acquire four additional self storage properties.\n \n\n\nOn December 20, 2018, certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries (\u201cCredit Facility Secured Subsidiaries\u201d) entered into a revolving credit loan agreement (collectively, the \u201cCredit Facility Loan Agreement\u201d) between the Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries and TCF National Bank (\u201cCredit Facility Lender\u201d). Under the Credit Facility Loan Agreement, the Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries may borrow from the Credit Facility Lender in the principal amount of up to $10 million pursuant to a promissory note (the \u201cCredit Facility Promissory Note\u201d). The Credit Facility Promissory Note bears an interest rate equal to 3.00% over the One Month U.S. Dollar London Inter-Bank Offered Rate and was due to mature on December 20, 2021. The obligations under the Credit Facility Loan Agreement are secured by certain real estate assets owned by the Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries. We entered into a guaranty of payment on December 20, 2018 (the \u201cCredit Facility Guaranty,\u201d and together with the Credit Facility Loan Agreement, the Credit Facility Promissory Note and related instruments, the \u201cCredit Facility Loan Documents\u201d) to guarantee the payment to the Credit Facility Lender of certain obligations of the Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries under the Credit Facility Loan Agreement. As described in more detail below, the Credit Facility Loan Agreement has been replaced in its entirety by the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement (as defined below) on July 6, 2021.\n\n\nOn December 18, 2019, we completed a rights offering whereby we sold and issued an aggregate of 1,601,291 shares of our common stock (\u201ccommon stock\u201d) at the subscription price of $4.18 per whole share of common stock, pursuant to the exercise of subscriptions and oversubscriptions from our stockholders. We raised aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $6.7 million in the rights offering.\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn May 19, 2020, Midas Management Corporation (\u201cMMC\u201d) (the \u201cBorrower\u201d) entered into a Paycheck Protection Program Term Note (\u201cPPP Note\u201d) with Customers Bank on behalf of itself and Winmill & Co. Incorporated, Bexil Corporation, Tuxis Corporation, and/or their affiliates (collectively with the Company, the \u201cAffiliates\u201d) under the Paycheck Protection Program (the \u201cProgram\u201d) of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the \u201cSBA\u201d). Certain officers and directors of the Company also serve as officers and/or directors of the Affiliates. Pursuant to an arrangement between a professional employer organization and the Affiliates, MMC acts as a conduit payer of compensation and benefits to the Affiliates\u2019 employees including those who are concurrently employed by the Company and its Affiliates. The Borrower received total proceeds of $486,602 from the PPP Note of which approximately $300,000 was attributable to the Company under the SBA\u2019s loan determination formula. In accordance with the requirements of the CARES Act, the Affiliates used the proceeds from the PPP Note primarily for payroll and other eligible costs. Interest accrues on the PPP Note at the rate per annum of 1.00%. In March 2021, the Borrower applied to Customers Bank for forgiveness of the amount due on the PPP Note in an amount equal to the sum of payroll and other eligible costs incurred during the Covered Period, as defined therein, following disbursement under the PPP Note.\n\n\nOn October 8, 2021, the Borrower received the SBA\u2019s final loan review decision which denied forgiveness of the loan in full. On November 4, 2021, the Borrower filed an appeal petition with the SBA\u2019s Office of Hearings and Appeals within the 30 calendar day period after receipt of the final loan review decision. The Borrower's timely filing of the appeal extended the loan deferment period. On January 25, 2022, the SBA\u2019s Office of Hearings and Appeals dismissed Borrower's appeal petition without prejudice and remanded the matter to the SBA for further review of loan forgiveness. The loan deferment period has been extended until the SBA reaches a conclusion on loan forgiveness. We cannot predict how long it will take the SBA to complete its review or provide assurance that we will obtain forgiveness of our portion of the PPP Note in whole or in part. If forgiveness is not granted, we will need to repay the interest on our portion of the PPP Note.\n\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, there has been no material impact to our operations or cash flows due to the PPP Note. If and when the PPP Note is in part or wholly forgiven, and legal release is received, we expect to record a gain in an amount proportionate to our share of payroll costs and other eligible expenses incurred during the Covered Period. We expect the loan forgiveness to reduce such expenses and reduce related reimbursements to MMC and Winco accordingly.\n\n\nOn June 25, 2021, we completed an underwritten public offering whereby we sold and issued an aggregate of 1,121,496 shares of our common stock at the price of $5.35 per share. Subsequently, the over-allotment option was exercised increasing the total number of shares sold and issued to 1,289,720. We raised aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $6.9 million in the public offering after giving effect to the exercise of the over-allotment option.\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn July 6, 2021, certain wholly owned subsidiaries (\u201cAmended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries\u201d) of the Company entered into a first amendment to the Credit Facility Loan Agreement (collectively, the \u201cAmended Credit Facility Loan Agreement\u201d) between the Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries and The Huntington National Bank, successor by merger to TCF National Bank (\u201cAmended Credit Facility Lender\u201d). Under the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement, the Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries may borrow from the Amended Credit Facility Lender in the principal amount of up to $15 million pursuant to a promissory note (the \u201cAmended Credit Facility Promissory Note\u201d). The Amended Credit Facility Promissory Note bears an interest rate equal to 3% plus the greater of the One Month U.S. Dollar London Inter-Bank Offered Rate or one-quarter of one percent (0.25%) and is due to mature on July 6, 2024. As of December 31, 2021, the effective interest rate was 3.25%. The obligations under the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement are secured by certain real estate assets owned by the Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries. The Company entered into an amended and restated guaranty of payment on July 6, 2021 (\u201cAmended Credit Facility Guaranty,\u201d and together with the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement, the Amended Credit Facility Promissory Note and related instruments, the \u201cAmended Credit Facility Loan Documents\u201d) to guarantee the payment to the Amended Credit Facility Lender of certain obligations of the Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries under the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement. The Company and the Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries paid customary fees and expenses in connection with their entry into the Amended Credit Facility Loan Documents. The Company also maintains a bank account at the Amended Credit Facility Lender. As of December 31, 2021, we have no withdrawn proceeds under the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement. We currently intend to strategically withdraw proceeds available under the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement to fund: (i) the acquisition of additional self storage properties, (ii) expansions at existing self storage properties in our portfolio, and/or (iii) joint ventures with third parties for the acquisition and expansion of self storage properties.\n \n\n\nOn January 14, 2022, the Company entered into an At Market Offering Sales Agreement (the \u201cSales Agreement\u201d) with B. Riley Securities, Inc. (the \u201cAge\nnt\u201d) pursuant to which the Company may sell, from time to time, shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to $15,000,000, through the Agent. \nAs of the date of this filing\n, under the Sales Agreement, the Company has sold and issued an aggregate of 65,843 shares of our common stock and raised aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $403,364, less sales commissions of approximately $8,069.\n\n\nOur Third-Party Management Platform\n\n\nOn October 23, 2019, we signed our first self storage client under our third-party management platform. As of December 31, 2021, the property, which was rebranded as \u201cGlobal Self Storage,\u201d had 137,118-leasable square feet and was comprised of 618 climate-controlled and non-climate-controlled units located in Edmond, Oklahoma.\n \n\n\nWe may pursue third-party management opportunities of properties owned by certain affiliates or joint venture partners for a fee, and utilize such relationships with third-party owners as a source for future acquisitions and investment opportunities.\n \n\n\nRegulation\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\nGenerally, self storage properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including those relating to lien sale rights and procedures, public accommodations, insurance, and the environment. Changes in any of these laws, ordinances or regulations could increase the potential liability existing or created by tenants or others on our properties. Laws, ordinances, or regulations affecting development, construction, operation, upkeep, safety and taxation requirements may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, loss of self storage sites or other impairments to operations, which would adversely affect our cash flows from operating activities.\n\n\nUnder the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the \u201cADA\u201d), all places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. For additional information on the ADA, see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u2014Risks Related to Our Business\u2014Costs associated with complying with the ADA may result in unanticipated expenses.\u201d\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInsurance activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as determined by the particular insurance commissioner for each state in accordance with the McCarran-Ferguson Act, as well as subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the privacy regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant thereto.\n\n\nUnder the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (\u201cCERCLA\u201d), and comparable state laws, we may be required to investigate and remediate regulated hazardous materials at one or more of our properties. For additional information on environmental matters and regulation, see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u2014Risks Related to Our Business\u2014Extensive environmental regulation to which we are subject creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures and liabilities.\u201d\n\n\nProperty management activities are often subject to state real estate brokerage laws and regulations as determined by the particular real estate commission for each state.\n\n\nREIT Qualification\n\n\nWe have elected and we believe that we have qualified to be taxed as a REIT under the Code, commencing with our taxable year ended on December 31, 2013. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our net taxable income to the extent that we distribute annually all of our net taxable income to our stockholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT. We believe that we have been organized and have operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code, and we expect that our intended manner of operation will enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. To qualify, and maintain our qualification, as a REIT, we must meet on a continuing basis, through our organization and actual investment and operating results, various requirements under the Code relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our shares. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates and may be precluded from qualifying as a REIT for the subsequent four taxable years following the year during which we failed to qualify as a REIT. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we still may be subject to some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income or assets. In addition, subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT, a portion of our business is conducted through, and a portion of our income is earned by, one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries (\u201cTRSs\u201d), which are subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax at regular rates. Distributions paid by us generally will not be eligible for taxation at the preferential U.S. federal income tax rates that currently apply to certain distributions received by individuals from taxable corporations, unless such distributions are attributable to dividends received by us from a TRS.\n\n\nCompetition\n\n\nWe compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for customers and acquisitions of self storage properties and other assets, including national, regional, and local owners, operators, and developers of self storage properties. We compete based on a number of factors including location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property\u2019s design to prospective tenants\u2019 needs, and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. We believe that the primary competition for potential customers comes from other self storage properties within a three to five mile radius from our stores. We have positioned our properties within their respective markets as high-quality operations that emphasize tenant convenience, security, and professionalism.\n\n\nWe also may compete with numerous other potential buyers when pursuing a possible property for acquisition, which can increase the potential cost of a project. These competing bidders also may possess greater resources than us and therefore be in a better position to acquire a property.\n \n\n\nOur primary national competitors in many of our markets for both tenants and acquisition opportunities include local and regional operators, institutional investors, private equity funds, as well as the other public self storage REITs. These entities also seek financing through similar channels to the Company. Therefore, we will continue to compete for institutional investors in a market where funds for real estate investment may decrease.\n\n\nHuman Capital\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe seek to create a diverse and inclusive work environment that values each employee\u2019s talents and contributions. Our success relies on the general professionalism of our property managers and staff which are contributing factors to our ability to successfully secure rentals, retain tenants and maintain clean and secure self\n \n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nstorage properties. We seek to increase employee retention and well-being and our employees enjoy an attractive benefit package that includes medical, dental, vision, life insurance, 401(k) with matching employer contribution, cash bonuses, and long-term equity compensation. We offer competitive health benefits and encourage our employees to participate in employee health and wellness programs. We also offer individualized counseling to our employees to assist them with their journey towards better health.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe also seek to promote diversity among our employees and management team. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 44% of our non-store (including finance, human resources, accounting, tax, legal, and marketing, but excluding store-level operations) employees and independent contractors were women. As of December 31, 2021, we had 28 employees, which includes employees of our property management platform.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn order to attract and retain diverse top talent, we offer training and development opportunities for our employees. In 2021, we offered training and development for our employees, which included anti-harassment training, cyber security training, and site manager training.  We value the safety of our employees and provide regular training for our employees to increase safety at our properties. During 2021, we continued to make masks and other personal protective equipment available to our employees.\n\n\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are focused on building our company for the long-term to generate sustainable growth. To that end, we have established a cross-functional Environmental, Social, and Governance (\u201cESG\n\u201d\n) committee responsible for establishing our sustainability priorities and objectives. Management regularly evaluates sustainability risks faced by our portfolio and believe the low obsolescence, geographic diversification, and low emissions of our portfolio help to mitigate those risks. Our ESG committee will report annually to our board of directors on the status of our ESG program, our progress against the goals we have set, and provide updates on the various initiatives we have undertaken to improve our sustainability.\n\n\nA key area of focus from a sustainability perspective is minimizing the impact we make on the environment. Self-storage remains a low-environmental impact business as it consumes less energy and water while emitting fewer greenhouse gases than other real estate property types. We continue to look for ways to further reduce our low impact through a variety of initiatives including solar panel installations, HVAC upgrades, high-efficiency LED lighting retrofits, energy management systems, and paper reduction through our online rental platform. Also, in 2021, we began to explore the installation of solar panels at our properties which we expect would reduce energy consumption and costs at such locations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nClimate Change and Environmental Stewardship\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are committed to managing climate-related risks and opportunities in relation to our business. This commitment is a key component of our recognition that we must operate in a responsible and sustainable manner that aligns with our long-term corporate strategy and promotes our best interests along with those of our stakeholders, including our tenants, investors, employees, and the communities in which we operate.\n \n\n\nOur ESG committee will guide our commitment to sustainability and will have primary responsibility for climate-related activities. Our ESG committee will report annually to our board of directors, which oversees all of our sustainability initiatives.\n\n\n \nWe consider potential environmental impacts\u2014both positive and negative\u2014into our decision making across the business. The following features of our properties reflect our commitment to responsible environmental stewardship:\n \n\n\n\u2022\nLow environmental impact.\n Our properties have an inherently light environmental footprint that we further reduce through environmentally friendly capital initiatives.\n\n\n\u2022\nLow obsolescence.\n Our properties are expected to retain functional and physical usefulness over many decades. This contrasts with other real estate types that require frequent reinvestment (i.e., capital \n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nexpenditures) to stay current with tenant preference, remain competitive with newer competition, offset heavier wear-and-tear by users, and maintain structural operating efficiency.\n\n\n\u2022\nHigh structural resilience.\n We operate our properties to avoid deferred maintenance, which may mitigate risks from rising water levels, changing temperatures, and natural disasters.\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nAvailable Information\n \n\n\nThe SEC maintains an Internet site at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. Additional information about the Company, not contained in this annual report or made a part hereof, may be found at www.GlobalSelfStorage.us. \nThe information on our website is not intended to form a part of or be incorporated by reference into this annual report.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "item1a": ">Item 1A. Ris\nk Factors.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with the other information contained in this annual report. Any of these risks described could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, tax status or ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations. If this were to happen, the price of our securities could decline significantly, and you could lose a part or all of your investment.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to our Self Storage Properties and our Business\n\n\nAdverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we do business and more broadly could negatively affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our operating results.\n\n\nOur operating results are dependent upon our ability to achieve optimal occupancy levels and rental rates at our self storage properties. Adverse economic or other conditions, such as during a government shutdown, in the markets in which we do business, may lower our occupancy levels and limit our ability to maintain or increase rents or require us to offer rental discounts. No single customer represents a significant concentration of our revenues. The following adverse developments, among others, in the markets in which we do business may adversely affect the operating performance of our properties:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nperceptions by prospective tenants of our self storage properties of the safety, convenience, and attractiveness of such properties and the areas in which they are located;\n\n\n\u2022\nindustry slowdowns, relocation of businesses and changing demographics may adversely impact the markets in which we invest and in which our self storage properties operate;\n\n\n\u2022\nperiods of economic slowdown or recession, rising interest rates, or declining demand for self storage or the public perception that any of these events may occur could result in a general decline in rental rates or new rentals or an increase in tenant defaults; and\n\n\n\u2022\nactual or perceived oversupply or declining demand for self storage in a particular area.\n\n\nOur operations may be affected by\n \ngeneral economic, political and market conditions.\n\n\nOur operations may be affected by global and national economic, political and market conditions generally. Any of the following events could result in substantial impact to our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nchanges in global, national, regional or local economic, demographic or capital market conditions;\n\n\n\u2022\na recession, slowdown or sustained downturn in the U.S. market, and to a lesser extent, the global economy (or any particular segment thereof);\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\noverall weakening of, or disruptions in, the financial markets; \n\n\n\u2022\nincreases in interest rates, inflationary pressures;\n\n\n\u2022\nsupply chain related disruptions, such as those caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; \n\n\n\u2022\ngeopolitical challenges and uncertainties (including wars and other forms of conflict, terrorist acts and security operations), such as the escalating conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the severe economic sanctions and export controls imposed by the U.S. and other governments against Russia and Russian interests; and\n\n\n\u2022\nchanges in government rules, regulations and fiscal policies, including increases in taxes, changes in zoning laws and increasing costs to comply with environmental laws.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAll of these factors are beyond our control. Any negative changes in these factors could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe outbreak of highly infectious or contagious diseases or another public health crisis, including the novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d), could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, the spread of COVID-19 has caused and a future public health crisis could cause severe disruptions in the U.S. and global economy and financial markets and has created or could create widespread business continuity issues of an as yet unknown magnitude and duration.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted global economic activity and caused significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. The global impact of the pandemic has been widespread and many countries, including the United States, have reacted by instituting quarantines, mandating business and school closures, requiring restrictions on travel\n and issuing \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d and/or \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders, and imposing restrictions on the types of businesses that may continue to operate\n. Such actions have caused disruptions in global supply chains, and have adversely impacted a number of industries.\n \n\n\nWhile the containment measures described above generally do not apply to our business as \nself storage has been identified by the Department of Homeland Security as a Critical Infrastructure Sector and has been deemed an essential business in all states where we have operations,\n such measures may apply to certain of our tenants, employees, vendors, and lenders and there are no guarantees that, despite remaining open, \ntenants will be willing to visit our self storage properties or that\n future measures will not mandate the closure of one or more of our self storage properties\n. Even as efforts to contain the pandemic, including vaccinations, have made progress and many restrictions have been relaxed or lifted, resurgences and new variants of the virus have caused and may continue to cause additional outbreaks and there is substantial uncertainty about the nature and degree of the continued effects of COVID-19 over time.\n\n\nOutbreaks of highly infectious or contagious diseases or another public health crisis, such as COVID-19, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows due to, among other factors:\n\n\n\u2022\nreduced mobility and economic activity resulting from the containment measures mentioned above or otherwise attributable to a public health crisis or the response thereto could result in an economic downturn or prolonged recession, which could negatively impact consumer discretionary spending and could result in a general decline in business activity and demand for self storage and tenant traffic at our self storage properties and such reduction in demand and traffic could adversely affect, among other things, occupancy levels and rental rates at our self storage properties, our revenues, including both rental revenues and revenues from various ancillary products and services, such as moving and packing supplies, and other services, such as tenant insurance, our growth or opportunities for growth, our ability or desire to conduct future acquisitions of self storage properties and/or future or ongoing expansions of our existing self storage properties, and the ability to lease available space at self storage properties that we have expanded or are under ongoing expansion or at properties that we may acquire or have acquired with relatively low occupancy which may also adversely impact the expected performance and success of our strategic endeavors;\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nsuch reduced economic activity and the resulting rise in unemployment and potential disruptions in financial markets resulting therefrom could result in terminations of leases by tenants, tenant bankruptcies and the inability of our tenants to meet their obligations to us in full, or at all, or to otherwise seek modifications of such obligations, and may cause states to put into effect state of emergency orders which may restrict our ability to increase rent or evict delinquent tenants all of which could increase uncollectible receivables and cause reductions in revenue;\n\n\n\u2022\ndifficulty accessing debt and equity capital on attractive terms, or at all, and a severe disruption and instability in the global financial markets or deteriorations in credit and financing conditions may affect our access to capital necessary to fund business operations, potential acquisitions of self storage properties and/or future or ongoing expansions of our existing self storage properties, or other growth opportunities or to address maturing liabilities on a timely basis;\n\n\n\u2022\nthe financial impact, including potential decreases in cash from operations resulting therefrom, could negatively impact our future compliance with the financial covenants in our loan agreements and result in a default and potential acceleration of indebtedness, which could negatively impact our ability to make additional borrowings under loan agreements or otherwise and to pay dividends;\n\n\n\u2022\nthe potential negative impact on the health of our personnel, particularly if a significant number of them are impacted, the interrupted availability of personnel, including our executive officers and other employees, and our potential inability to recruit, attract and retain additional skilled personnel to manage our business and/or self storage properties, and the inability of other third-party vendors we rely on to conduct our business to operate effectively and continue to support our business and operations, including vendors that provide IT services, legal and accounting services, or other operational support services, could result in a deterioration of our business or our ability to ensure business continuity; \n\n\n\u2022\nmoratoriums on construction and macro-economic factors may cause construction contractors to be unable to perform, which may delay the start or completion of certain redevelopment or expansion projects by us and adversely impact our strategic endeavors; and\n\n\n\u2022\nany of the above factors, or a combination thereof, could negatively and materially impact significant estimates and assumptions we use including, but not limited to estimates of expected credit losses and the fair value estimates of our assets and liabilities and may cause us to recognize impairment in value of our tangible or intangible assets.\n\n\nFurther, while we carry comprehensive property and casualty insurance along with other insurance policies that may provide some coverage for any losses or costs incurred in connection with a public health crisis, given the potential novelty of the issue and the potential scale of losses incurred throughout the world, there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover all or any portion of potential losses and costs under these policies.\n\n\nThe factors described above, as well as additional factors that we may not currently be aware of, could materially impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, to the extent any of these risks and uncertainties adversely impact us in the ways described above or otherwise, they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, if in the future there is an outbreak of another highly infectious or contagious disease or other public health crisis, we and our self storage properties may be subject to risks similar to those posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nOur proportionate share of the loan entered into by an affiliate on our behalf under the Paycheck Protection Program may not be forgiven or may subject us to challenges and investigations regarding qualification for the loan.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn May 19, 2020, Midas Management Corporation (\u201cMMC\u201d) (the \u201cBorrower\u201d), a subsidiary of Winmill & Co. Incorporated (\u201cWinco\u201d), entered into a Paycheck Protection Program Term Note (\u201cPPP Note\u201d) with Customers Bank on behalf of itself and the Affiliates under the Paycheck Protection Program (the \u201cProgram\u201d) of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the \u201cSBA\u201d). Certain officers and directors of the Company also serve as officers and directors of Winco, Bexil Corporation, Tuxis Corporation, and their affiliates (collectively with the Company, the \u201cAffiliates\u201d). Pursuant to an\n \n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\narrangement between a professional employer organization and the Affiliates, MMC acts as a conduit payer of compensation and benefits to the Affiliates\u2019 employees including those who are concurrently employed by the Company and its Affiliates. The Borrower received total proceeds of $486,602 from the PPP Note of which approximately $300,000 was attributable to the Company under the SBA\u2019s loan determination formula. In accordance with the requirements of the CARES Act, the Affiliates used the proceeds from the PPP Note primarily for payroll and other eligible costs. Interest accrues on the PPP Note at the rate per annum of 1.00%. In March 2021, the Borrower applied to Customers Bank for forgiveness of the amount due on the PPP Note in an amount equal to the sum of payroll and other eligible costs incurred during the twenty-four weeks (the \u201cCovered Period\u201d), following disbursement under the PPP Note.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn October 8, 2021, the Borrower received the SBA\u2019s final loan review decision which denied forgiveness of the loan in full. On November 4, 2021, the Borrower filed an appeal petition with the SBA\u2019s Office of Hearings and Appeals within the 30 calendar day period after receipt of the final loan review decision. The Borrower's timely filing of the appeal has extended the loan deferment period. On January 25, 2022, the SBA\u2019s Office of Hearings and Appeals dismissed Borrower's appeal petition without prejudice and remanded the matter to the SBA for further review of loan forgiveness. The loan deferment period has been extended until the SBA reaches a conclusion on loan forgiveness. We cannot predict how long it will take the SBA to complete its review or provide assurance that we will obtain forgiveness of our portion of the PPP Note in whole or in part. If forgiveness is not granted, we will need to repay the interest on our portion of the PPP Note.\n\n\n        During the period from May 19, 2020 through the ten-month period following the last day of the Covered Period (the \u201cDeferral Expiration Date\u201d), neither principal nor interest shall be due and payable. On the Deferral Expiration Date, the outstanding principal of the PPP Note or the amount that is not forgiven under the Program shall convert to an amortizing term loan. On May 19, 2022, all accrued interest that is not forgiven under the Program shall be due and payable. Additionally, on December 19, 2020 and continuing on the 19th day of each month thereafter until May 19, 2022 equal installments of principal shall be due and payable, each in an amount determined by the Lender (the \u201cMonthly Principal Amount\u201d). Interest shall be payable at the same time as the Monthly Principal Amount. Any outstanding principal and accrued interest shall be due and payable in full on May 19, 2022. We expect to contribute to the interest payable on the PPP Note in proportion to our share of payroll and other eligible costs used in the original calculation of the loan request.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021, there has been no material impact to our operations or cash flows due to the PPP Note. If and when the PPP Note is, in part or wholly forgiven, and legal release is received, we expect to record a gain in an amount proportionate to our share of payroll costs and other eligible expenses incurred during the Covered Period. We expect any loan forgiveness to reduce such expenses and reduce related reimbursements to MMC and Winco accordingly.\n\n\nAdditionally, the Treasury Department and SBA continue to develop and issue new and updated regulations and guidance regarding the Program\u2019s loan process, including regarding required borrower certifications and requirements for forgiveness of loans made under the Program. We continue to track the regulations and guidance as they are released and assess and re-assess various aspects of its forgiveness application as necessary. Finally, we may be subject to CARES Act-specific lookbacks and audits conducted by the Treasury, SBA or other federal agencies, including oversight bodies created under the CARES Act. These bodies have the ability to coordinate investigations and audits and refer matters to the Department of Justice for civil or criminal enforcement and other actions.\n \n\n\nOur storage leases are relatively short-term in nature, which exposes us to the risk that we may have to re-lease our units and we may be unable to do so on attractive terms, on a timely basis or at all.\n\n\nIf we are unable to promptly re-let our units or if the rates upon such re-letting are significantly lower than expected, then our business and results of operations would be adversely affected. Any delay in re-letting units as vacancies arise would reduce our revenues and harm our operating results. In addition, lower than expected rental rates upon re-letting could adversely affect our revenues and impede our growth.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIncreases in taxes and regulatory compliance costs may reduce our income and adversely impact our cash flows.\n\n\nIncreases in income or other taxes generally are not passed through to tenants under leases and may reduce our net income, funds from operations (\u201cFFO\u201d), cash flows, financial condition, ability to pay or refinance our debt\n \n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nobligations, ability to make cash distributions to stockholders, and the trading price of our securities. Similarly, changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which could result in similar adverse effects.\n\n\nOur property taxes could increase due to various reasons, including a reassessment, which could adversely impact our operating results and cash flow.\n\n\nThe value of our properties may be reassessed for property tax purposes by taxing authorities including as a result of the acquisition of new self storage properties. Accordingly, the amount of property taxes we pay in the future may increase substantially from what we have paid in the past. Increases in property or other taxes generally are not passed through to tenants under leases and may reduce our results of operations and cash flow, and could adversely affect our ability to pay any expected dividends to our stockholders.\n \n\n\nIncreases in operating costs may adversely affect our results of operation and cash flow.\n\n\nIncreases in operating costs, including insurance costs, labor costs, utilities, capital improvements, real estate assessments and other taxes and costs of compliance with REIT requirements and with other laws, regulations and governmental policies could adversely affect our results of operation and cash flow.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe depend upon our on-site personnel to maximize tenant satisfaction at each of our properties, and any difficulties we encounter in hiring, training, and maintaining skilled field personnel may harm our operating performance.\n\n\nWe depend upon our on-site personnel to maximize tenant satisfaction at each of our properties, and any difficulties we encounter in hiring, training and maintaining skilled field personnel may harm our operating performance. The general professionalism of a site\u2019s managers and staff are contributing factors to a site\u2019s ability to successfully secure rentals and retain tenants. If we are unable to successfully recruit, train and retain qualified field personnel, our quality of service could be adversely affected, which could lead to decreased occupancy levels and reduced operating performance.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe face competition from other self storage properties, which may adversely impact the markets in which we invest and in which our self storage properties operate.\n\n\nIncreased competition in the self storage business has led to both pricing and discount pressures. This increased competition could limit our ability to increase revenues in the markets in which we operate. While some markets may be able to absorb an increase in self storage properties due to superior demographics and density, other markets may not be able to absorb additional properties and may not perform as well.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRental revenues are significantly influenced by demand for self storage space generally, and a decrease in such demand would likely have a greater adverse effect on our rental revenues than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio or if we owned a larger number of self storage properties.\n\n\nBecause our portfolio of properties consists of only self storage properties, we are subject to risks inherent in investments in a single industry. A decrease in the demand for self storage space would have a greater adverse effect on our rental revenues than it would if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio. Demand for self storage space has been and could be adversely affected by ongoing weakness in the national, regional and local economies, changes in supply of, or demand for, similar or competing self storage properties in an area and the excess amount of self storage space in a particular market. To the extent that any of these conditions occur, they are likely to affect market rents for self storage space, which could cause a decrease in our rental revenue. Any such decrease could impair our operating results, ability to satisfy debt service obligations and ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFurther, currently we invest in a limited number of self storage properties. As a result, the potential effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash available for distribution to stockholders, resulting from poor performance at one or more of our self storage properties could be more pronounced than if we invested in a larger number of self storage properties.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions, or integrating and operating acquired properties, which may adversely impact our growth.\n\n\nWe expect to make future acquisitions of self storage properties. We may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions that meet our criteria, which may impede our growth. We may encounter competition when we seek to acquire properties, especially for brokered portfolios. Aggressive bidding practices by prospective acquirers have been commonplace and this competition also may be a challenge for our growth strategy and potentially result in our paying higher prices for acquisitions including paying consideration for certain properties that may exceed the value of such properties. Should we pay higher prices for self storage properties or other assets, our potential profitability may be reduced. Also, when we acquire any self storage properties, we will be required to integrate them into our then existing portfolio. The acquired properties may turn out to be less compatible with our growth strategy than originally anticipated, may cause disruptions in our operations or may divert management\u2019s attention away from day-to-day operations, which could impair our results of operations. Our ability to acquire or integrate properties may also be constrained by the following additional risks:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nthe inability to achieve satisfactory completion of due diligence investigations and other customary closing conditions;\n\n\n\u2022\nspending more than the time and amounts budgeted to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties;\n\n\n\u2022\nthe inability to build a captive pipeline of target properties that meet our rigorous underwriting standards; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe inability to accurately estimate occupancy levels, rental rates, operating costs or costs of improvements to bring an acquired property up to the standards established for our intended market position; and \n\n\n\u2022\nencountering delays in the selection, acquisition, development or redevelopment of self storage properties which could adversely affect returns to stockholders and stockholders could suffer delays in the distribution of cash dividends attributable to any such properties.\n\n\nWe may not be able to develop a captive pipeline of acquisition targets without the use of non-refundable deposits.\n\n\nWe may be required to use non-refundable deposits to develop a captive pipeline of acquisition targets. If we are unable to raise the capital necessary to consummate such acquisitions we may be forced to abandon all or some of the acquisitions and forfeit any non-refundable deposits. If this occurs, it could adversely impact our operating results and our ability to pay any expected dividends to our stockholders.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may acquire properties subject to liabilities which may adversely impact our operating results.\n\n\nWe may acquire properties subject to liabilities without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities such as liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination, claims by persons dealing with the former owners of the properties and claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties. The costs associated with these liabilities may adversely impact our operating results.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur investments in development and redevelopment projects may not yield anticipated returns which could adversely impact our economic performance.\n\n\nIn deciding whether to develop or redevelop a particular property, we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property. These assumptions are inherently uncertain, and, if they prove to be wrong, then we may be subject to certain risks including the following:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nwe may not complete development projects on schedule or within projected budgeted amounts;\n\n\n\u2022\nwe may underestimate the costs necessary to bring a property up to the standards established for its intended market position;\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nwe may encounter delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations; \n\n\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to increase occupancy at a newly acquired property as quickly as expected or at all; and\n\n\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to obtain financing for these projects on favorable terms or at all.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe occurrence of such events could adversely affect the investment returns from these development or redevelopment projects and may adversely impact our economic performance.\n\n\nStore ownership through joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest.\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may co-invest with third parties through joint ventures. In any such joint venture, we may not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the stores owned through joint ventures. Investments in joint ventures may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present when a third party is not involved, including the possibility that joint venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. Joint venture partners may have business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. Such investments also have the potential risk of impasse on strategic decisions, such as a sale, in cases where neither we nor the joint venture partner would have full control over the joint venture. In other circumstances, joint venture partners may have the ability without our agreement to make certain major decisions, including decisions about sales, capital expenditures, and/or financing. Any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners could result in litigation or arbitration that could increase our expenses and distract our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and effort on our business. In addition, we might in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our joint venture partners, and the activities of a joint venture could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT, even though we do not control the joint venture.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur performance is subject to risks associated with the real estate industry.\n\n\nAn investment in us is closely linked to the performance of the real estate markets in which we own self storage properties and subject to the risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate, including fluctuations in interest rates, inflation or deflation; declines in the value of real estate; and competition from other real estate investors with significant capital. Prevailing economic conditions affecting the real estate industry may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIlliquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties.\n\n\nWe may be unable to promptly sell one or more properties in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. We cannot give assurances that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements. In acquiring a property, we may agree to transfer restrictions that materially restrict us from selling that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions, such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property. These transfer restrictions may impede our ability to sell a property even if we deem it necessary or appropriate. We may also have joint venture investments in certain of our properties and, consequently, our ability to control decisions relating to such properties may be limited.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAny negative perceptions of the self storage industry generally may result in a decline in our stock price.\n\n\nTo the extent that the investing public has a negative perception of the self storage industry, the value of our securities may be negatively impacted.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCosts associated with complying with the ADA may result in unanticipated expenses.\n\n\nOur self storage properties also are subject to risks related to changes in, and changes in enforcement of, federal, state and local laws, regulations and governmental policies, including fire and safety requirements, health, zoning and tax laws, governmental fiscal policies and the ADA. Local regulations, including municipal or local ordinances, zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers may restrict our use of our properties and may require us to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations at any time with respect to our properties, including prior to acquiring a property or when undertaking renovations of any of our existing properties. Further, compliance with the ADA and other regulations may require us to make unanticipated expenditures that could significantly reduce cash available for distribution to stockholders. A failure to comply with the ADA or similar state laws could lead to government imposed fines on us and/or litigation, which could also involve an award of damages to individuals affected by the noncompliance. Such noncompliance also could result in an order to correct any noncomplying feature, which could result in substantial capital expenditures.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nExtensive environmental regulation to which we are subject creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures and liabilities.\n\n\nUnder environmental regulations such as CERCLA, owners and operators of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigating and remediating certain hazardous substances or other regulated materials on or in such property. Such laws often impose liability, without regard to knowledge or fault, for removal or remediation of hazardous substances or other regulated materials upon owners and operators of contaminated property, even after they no longer own or operate the property. Moreover, the past or present owner or operator of a property from which a release emanates could be liable for any personal injuries or property damages that may result from such releases, as well as any damages to natural resources that may arise from such releases. The presence of such substances or materials, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner\u2019s or operator\u2019s ability to lease, sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nClimate change and regulatory and other efforts to reduce climate change could adversely affect our business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe face a number of risks associated with climate change including both transition and physical risks. The transition risks that could impact our company include those risks related to the impact of U.S. and foreign climate- and ESG-related legislation and regulation, as well as risks arising from climate-related business trends. Moreover, we are subject to risks stemming from the physical impacts of climate change.\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nNew climate change-related regulations or interpretations of existing laws may result in enhanced disclosure obligations that could negatively affect us and materially increase our regulatory burden. Increased regulations generally increase the costs to us, and those higher costs may continue to increase if new laws require additional resources, including spending more time, hiring additional personnel or investing in new technologies.\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nWe also face business trend-related climate risks. Investors are increasingly taking into account ESG factors, including climate risks, in determining whether to invest in companies. Additionally, our reputation and investor relationships could be damaged as a result of our involvement with activities perceived to be causing or exacerbating climate change, as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change.\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nFurther, significant physical effects of climate change including extreme weather events can also have an adverse impact on our properties. Additionally, both transition and physical risks associated with climate change could result in increased operating costs for our properties. As the effects of climate change increase, we expect the frequency and impact of weather and climate related events and conditions to increase as well. These risks may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may become subject to litigation or threatened litigation or other claims that may divert management\u2019s time and attention, require us to pay damages and expenses or restrict the operation of our business.\n\n\nWe may become subject to disputes with commercial parties with whom we maintain relationships or other parties with whom we do business. Any such dispute could result in litigation between us and the other parties.\n \n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhether or not any dispute actually proceeds to litigation, we may be required to devote significant management time and attention to its successful resolution (through litigation, settlement or otherwise), which would detract from our management\u2019s ability to focus on our business. Any such resolution could involve the payment of damages or expenses by us, which may be significant. In addition, any such resolution could involve our agreement with terms that restrict the operation of our business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFrom time to time we may be required to resolve tenant claims and litigation and employment-related claims and litigation by corporate level and field personnel which could result in substantial liabilities to us. We also could be sued for personal injuries and/or property damage occurring at our properties. The liability insurance we maintain may not cover all costs and expenses arising from such lawsuits.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow.\n\n\nWe maintain comprehensive liability, fire, flood, earthquake, wind, extended coverage and rental loss insurance (as deemed necessary or as required by our lenders, if any) with respect to our properties. Certain types of losses, however, may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable, such as losses due to earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, riots, acts of war or terrorism. Should an uninsured loss occur, we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a property. In addition, if any such loss is insured, we may be required to pay significant amounts on any claim for recovery of such a loss prior to our insurer being obligated to reimburse us for the loss, or the amount of the loss may exceed our coverage for the loss.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo the extent we invest in publicly traded REITs, our performance may be subject to the risks of investment in such securities.\n\n\nThe value of our investments in REITs may fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably. Because REITs concentrate their assets in the real estate industry, the performance of REITs is closely linked to the performance of the real estate markets. Property values may fall due to increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from economic, legal, cultural or technological developments, rising interest rates, and rising capitalization rates. REIT prices also may drop because of the failure of borrowers to pay their loans and poor management. In addition, there are specific risks associated with particular sectors of real estate investments such as self storage, retail, office, hotel, healthcare, and multi-family properties. Many REITs utilize leverage, which increases investment risk and could adversely affect a REIT\u2019s operations and market value in periods of rising interest rates as well as risks normally associated with debt financing. In addition, a REIT\u2019s failure to qualify as a REIT under the Code, or failure to maintain exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act could adversely affect our operations and our qualification as a REIT under the Code. The failure of these investments to perform as expected may have a significant effect on our performance and our ability to make distributions to stockholders.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may be unable to make distributions in the future, maintain our current level of distributions or increase distributions over time.\n\n\nThere are many factors that can affect the availability and timing of cash distributions to stockholders and the determination to make distributions will fall within the discretion of our board of directors. Our board of directors\u2019 decisions to pay distributions will depend on many factors, such as our historical and projected results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity, maintenance of our REIT qualification and other tax considerations, capital expenditure and other expense obligations, debt covenants, contractual prohibitions or other limitations and applicable law and such other matters as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time. Actual cash available for distributions may vary substantially from estimates. We may not have sufficient available cash from operations to make a distribution required to qualify for or maintain our REIT status. We may be required to borrow or make distributions that would constitute a return of capital which may reduce the amount of capital we invest in self storage properties. We cannot assure stockholders that we will be able to make distributions in the future, be able to maintain our current level of distributions or that our distributions will increase over time, and our inability to make distributions, or to make distributions at expected levels, could result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security breach through cyber-attacks, cyber-intrusions, or other methods could disrupt our information technology networks and related systems and harm our business.\n\n\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including, but not limited to, financial transactions and records, personally identifiable information, and tenant and lease data. In many cases, we rely significantly on third-party vendors to retain data, process transactions, and provide information technology and other system services. Our networks and operations could be disrupted, and sensitive data could be compromised, by physical or electronic security breaches, targeted against us, our vendors or other organizations, including financial markets or institutions, including by way of or through cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, phishing, employee theft or misuse, or inadequate security controls. We rely on third-party vendors and commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential tenant and other sensitive information. Although we make efforts to protect the security and integrity of our networks and systems, there can be no assurance that these efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful, as such attacks and breaches may be difficult to detect (or not detected at all) and are becoming more sophisticated. In such event, we may experience business interruptions or shutdowns; data loss, ransom, misappropriation, or corruption; theft or misuse of confidential or proprietary information; or litigation and investigation by tenants, governmental or regulatory agencies, or other third parties. Such events could also have other adverse impacts on us, including, but not limited to, regulatory penalties, breaches of debt covenants or other contractual or REIT compliance obligations, late or misstated financial reports, and significant diversion of management attention and resources. As a result, such events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and harm our business reputation.\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nPrivacy concerns could result in regulatory changes that may harm our business.\n\n\nPersonal privacy has become a significant issue in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Many jurisdictions in which we operate have imposed restrictions and requirements on the use of personal information by those collecting such information. Changes to law or regulations affecting privacy, if applicable to our business, could impose additional costs and liability on us and could limit our use and disclosure of such information.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Organization and Structure\n\n\nThe ability of our board of directors to revoke our REIT election without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders.\n\n\nOur board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election without the approval of stockholders if it determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a REIT. If we cease to qualify as a REIT, we would become subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our net taxable income to stockholders, which may have adverse consequences on the total return to our stockholders.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur business could be harmed if key personnel with business experience in the self storage industry terminate their employment with us.\n\n\nOur officers have experience in the self storage industry and our success will depend, to a significant extent, on their services. There is no guarantee that any of them will remain employed with us. We do not generally maintain key person life insurance. The loss of services of one or more members of our senior management could harm our business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThere may be conflicts of interest resulting from the relationships among us, our affiliates, and other related parties.\n\n\nThe outside business interests of our officers may divert their time and attention away from us, and may result in a potential conflict with respect to the allocation of business opportunities, which could harm our business. Our board of directors has adopted policies and procedures designed to mitigate these conflicts of interest, such as\n \n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nallocation procedures for determining the appropriate allocation of such business opportunities. Specifically, if any of our officers or directors who also serves as an officer, director, or advisor of our affiliates becomes aware of a potential transaction related primarily to the self storage business that may represent a corporate opportunity for us and one or more of our affiliates, such officer or director has no duty to present that opportunity to such affiliates and we will have the sole right to pursue the transaction if our board of directors so determines. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers or directors are encouraged to notify our affiliates of such an opportunity.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCertain provisions of Maryland law could inhibit changes in control of our company.\n\n\nCertain \u201cbusiness combination\u201d and \u201ccontrol share acquisition\u201d provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law (\u201cMGCL\u201d), may have the effect of deterring a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change in control under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our common stock. Pursuant to the MGCL, our board of directors has by resolution exempted business combinations between us and any other person. Our bylaws contain a provision exempting from the control share acquisition statute any and all acquisitions by any person of shares of our stock. However, there can be no assurance that these exemptions will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future. Our charter and bylaws and Maryland law also contain other provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or that our stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interest.\n \n\n\nOur rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited, which could limit your recourse in the event of actions not in your best interest.\n\n\nOur charter limits the liability of our present and former directors and officers to us and our stockholders for money damages to the maximum extent permitted under Maryland law. Under current Maryland law, our present and former directors and officers will not have any liability to us or our stockholders for money damages other than liability resulting from:\n\n\n\u2022\nactual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services; or \n\n\n\u2022\nactive and deliberate dishonesty by the director or officer that was established by a final judgment and is material to the cause of action.\n\n\n\tOur charter authorizes us to indemnify our present and former directors and officers for actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. Our bylaws require us to indemnify each present and former director or officer, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law, in connection with any proceeding to which he or she is made, or threatened to be made, a party to or witness in by reason of his or her service to us as a director or officer or in certain other capacities. In addition, we may be obligated to pay or reimburse the expenses incurred by our present and former directors and officers without requiring a preliminary determination of their ultimate entitlement to indemnification. As a result, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our present and former directors and officers than might otherwise exist absent the current provisions in our charter and bylaws or that might exist with other companies, which could limit your recourse in the event of actions not in your best interest.\n\n\nOur charter contains provisions that make removal of our directors difficult, which could make it difficult for our stockholders to effect changes to our management.\n\n\nOur charter provides that, subject to the rights of holders of one or more classes or series of preferred shares, a director may be removed with cause, by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors. Vacancies on our board of directors generally may be filled only by a majority of the remaining directors in office, even if less than a quorum. These requirements make it more difficult to change our management by removing and replacing directors and may prevent a change in our control that is in the best interests of our stockholders.\n\n\nWe may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business without stockholder consent, which may subject us to different risks.\n\n\nWe may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business at any time without the consent of our stockholders, which could result in our making investments and engaging in business\n \n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nactivities that are different from, and possibly riskier than, the investments and businesses described in this document. A change in our investment strategy or our entry into new lines of business may impact our ability to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT, or increase our exposure to other risks or real estate market fluctuations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf other self storage companies convert to a REIT structure or if tax laws change, we may no longer have an advantage in competing for potential acquisitions.\n\n\nBecause we are structured as a REIT, we are a more attractive acquirer of properties to tax-motivated sellers than our competitors that are not structured as REITs. However, if other self storage companies restructure their holdings to become REITs, this competitive advantage will disappear. In addition, new legislation may be enacted or new interpretations of existing legislation may be issued by the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), or the U.S. Treasury Department that could affect the attractiveness of the REIT structure so that it may no longer assist us in competing for acquisitions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur board of directors has the power to issue additional shares of our stock in a manner that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders.\n\n\nOur charter authorizes our board of directors to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares or the number of shares of any class or series without stockholder approval. In addition, our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. Our board of directors could issue additional shares of our common stock or establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise not be in the best interests of our stockholders.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRestrictions on ownership and transfer of our shares may restrict change of control or business combination opportunities in which our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn order for us to qualify as a REIT for each taxable year after our taxable year ended December 31, 2013, no more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares may be owned, directly or constructively, by five or fewer individuals during the last half of any calendar year, and at least 100 persons must beneficially own our shares during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months, or during a proportionate portion of a shorter taxable year. \u201cIndividuals\u201d for this purpose include natural persons, private foundations, some employee benefit plans and trusts, and some charitable trusts. Our charter contains, among other things, such customary provisions related to our current operation as a REIT and such other provisions that are consistent with the corporate governance profile of our public peers, including certain customary ownership limitations that prohibit, among other limitations, any person from beneficially or constructively owning more than 9.8% in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding share of our common stock or all classes and series of our capital stock. These ownership limits and the other restrictions on ownership and transfer of our shares in our charter could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which holders of our common stock might receive a premium for their shares over the then prevailing market price or which holders might believe to be otherwise in their best interests.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Debt Financings\n\n\nDisruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms or at all and have other adverse effects.\n\n\nUncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing or to refinance existing debt maturities on favorable terms (or at all), which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions. A downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing, and may require us to adjust our business plans accordingly. In addition, these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell, as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe depend on external sources of financing that are outside of our control, which could adversely affect our ability to acquire or develop properties, satisfy our debt obligations and/or make distributions to stockholders.\n\n\nWe depend on external sources of financing to acquire properties, to satisfy our debt obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders required to maintain our qualification as a REIT, and these sources of financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. Our access to external sources of financing depends on a number of factors, including the market\u2019s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and our ability to continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If we are unable to obtain external sources of financing, we may not be able to acquire properties when strategic opportunities exist, satisfy our debt obligations or make cash distributions to our stockholders that would permit us to qualify as a REIT or avoid paying U.S. federal income tax on all of our net taxable income.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe terms and covenants relating to our indebtedness could adversely impact our economic performance.\n\n\nThe Amended Credit Facility Loan Documents and Term Loan Documents contain (and any new or amended loan and/or facility we may enter into from time to time will likely contain) customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants that, among other things, require us to comply with a minimum net worth (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility Loan Documents and Term Loan Documents) of at least the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan and a minimum liquidity standard of at least 10% of the outstanding principal balance of the term loan (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility Loan Documents and Term Loan Documents). In the event that we fail to satisfy our covenants, we would be in default under the Amended Credit Facility Loan Documents and Term Loan Documents and may be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources. Under such circumstances, other sources of debt or equity capital may not be available to us, or may be available only on unattractive terms. Moreover, the presence of such covenants could cause us to operate our business with a view toward compliance with such covenants, which might not produce optimal returns for stockholders.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe discontinuation of U.S. dollar London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) may adversely affect our borrowing costs and the costs of any related hedging transactions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe terms of the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement refer to U.S. dollar LIBOR. As announced on March 5, 2021 by the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (\u201cIBA\u201d) and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, the IBA will cease publishing the overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month settings of U.S. dollar LIBOR rates immediately after June 30, 2023. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARCC\u201d), which was convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the New York Federal Reserve Bank, has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as the recommended risk-free alternative rate for U.S. dollar LIBOR. While the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement includes fallback language that would facilitate replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR, there can be no assurance that the benchmark replacement rate plus any spread adjustment will be economically equivalent to U.S. dollar LIBOR. In addition, market practices related to calculation conventions for replacement benchmark rates continue to develop and may vary, and inconsistent conventions may develop among financial products. Inconsistent use of replacement rates or calculation conventions among financial products could expose us to additional financial risks and increased costs. It is not possible to predict all consequences of the IBA\u2019s plans to cease publishing LIBOR, any related regulatory actions and the expected discontinuance of the use of LIBOR as a reference rate for financial contracts. Any transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates could result in financial market disruptions or significant increases in our borrowing costs or the costs of any related hedging, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our common stock.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Qualification as a REIT\n\n\nOur failure to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT would subject us to U.S. federal income tax and applicable state and local taxes, which would reduce the amount of operating cash flow available for distribution to stockholders.\n\n\nWe have elected, and believe that we have been qualified, to be taxed as a REIT commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2013. Qualification for treatment as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and extremely complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to\n \n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nqualify for REIT treatment. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet, on an ongoing basis through actual operating results, various tests regarding the nature and diversification of our assets and our income, the ownership of our outstanding shares and the amount of our distributions. Our compliance with the REIT income and quarterly asset requirements also depends upon our ability to manage successfully the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. Our ability to satisfy these asset tests depends upon an analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals. In addition, we have held and may continue to hold investments in other publicly traded REITs. If any such publicly traded REIT fails to qualify as a REIT with respect to any period during which we hold or have held shares of such REIT, or if our interests in these REITs are otherwise not treated as equity in a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our ability to satisfy the REIT requirements could be adversely affected. Moreover, new legislation, court decisions or administrative guidance may, in each case possibly with retroactive effect, make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a REIT. Thus, while we believe that we have been organized and operated and intend to operate so that we will continue to qualify as a REIT, given the highly complex nature of the rules governing REITs, the ongoing importance of factual determinations and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances, no assurance can be given that we have qualified or will so qualify for any particular year. These considerations also might restrict the types of assets that we can acquire or services that we can provide in the future. We have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the IRS regarding our qualification as a REIT.\n\n\nIn order to qualify as a REIT, among other requirements, we must ensure that at least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year, excluding certain amounts, is derived from certain real property-related sources, and at least 95% of our gross income for each taxable year, excluding certain amounts, is derived from certain real property-related sources and passive income such as dividends and interest. For purposes of these rules, income from the rental of real property is generally treated as qualifying income, whereas service income is generally treated as nonqualifying income. Furthermore, for purposes of these rules, services provided to tenants at a property could cause all income from the property to be nonqualifying if the income from such services, or the costs of providing those services, exceed certain thresholds. We have provided and may continue to provide certain services to our tenants, such as access to insurance. We believe that these services have been provided in a manner that does not cause our rental income to fail to be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the REIT gross income tests. However, if the IRS were to successfully challenge our characterization of these services, our qualification as a REIT could be adversely impacted. In addition, where we have provided services that may generate nonqualifying income, we believe the income attributable to these services and the costs of providing these services are sufficiently small so as not to cause us to fail to satisfy the REIT gross income tests. However, there is limited guidance regarding what costs are taken into account for this purpose. If the IRS were to successfully assert that our income from these services or the costs of providing these services exceeded certain thresholds, we could fail to qualify as a REIT.\n\n\nIf we fail to qualify for treatment as a REIT at any time and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we would be required to pay U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income, and possibly could be required to borrow money or sell assets to pay that tax, thus substantially reducing the funds available for distribution for each year involved. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we would also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost our qualification. In addition, all distributions to stockholders, including capital gain dividends, would be subject to tax as regular dividends to the extent of our earnings and profits.\n\n\nEven if we qualify as a REIT, we may face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow.\n\n\nEven though we believe that we currently qualify for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a REIT, we may face tax liabilities that will reduce our cash flow, including taxes on any undistributed income, state or local income and property and transfer taxes, including real property transfer taxes. In addition, we could, in certain circumstances, be required to pay an excise or penalty tax (which could be significant in amount) in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the Code to maintain our qualification as a REIT. Any of these taxes would decrease operating cash flow to our stockholders. In addition, in order to meet the REIT qualification requirements, or to avert the imposition of a 100% tax that applies to certain gains derived by a REIT from dealer property or inventory, we hold some of our assets and provide certain services to our tenants through one or more TRSs, or other subsidiary corporations that will be subject to corporate-level income tax at regular corporate rates. Any TRSs or other taxable corporations in which we invest will be subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate taxes. Furthermore, if we acquire appreciated assets from a corporation that is or has been a subchapter C corporation in a transaction in which the adjusted tax basis of such assets in the our hands is less than the fair market value of the assets, determined at the time we acquired such assets, and if we subsequently dispose of any such assets during the 5-year period following the acquisition of the\n \n\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nassets from the C corporation, we will be subject to tax at the highest corporate tax rates on any gain from the disposition of such assets to the extent of the excess of the fair market value of the assets on the date that we acquired such assets over the basis of such assets on such date, which are referred to as built-in gains. Payment of these taxes generally could materially and adversely affect our income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and prospects, and could adversely affect the value of our common stock and the ability to make distributions to stockholders.\n\n\nTo maintain our REIT qualification, we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions.\n\n\nIn order to maintain our REIT qualification and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes, we may need to borrow funds to meet the REIT distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. These borrowing needs could result from, among other things, timing differences between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. These sources, however, may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Our access to third-party sources of capital depends on a number of factors, including the market\u2019s perception of our growth potential, current debt levels, the per share trading price of our common stock, and our current and potential future earnings. We cannot assure you that we will have access to such capital on favorable terms at the desired times, or at all, which may cause us to curtail investment activities and/or to dispose of assets at inopportune times, and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and our ability to pay distributions on, and the per share trading price of, our common stock.\n\n\nFailure to make required distributions would subject us to tax, which would reduce the operating cash flow available for distribution to stockholders.\n\n\nFailure to make required distributions would subject us to tax, which would reduce the operating cash flow to our stockholders. In order to qualify as a REIT, we must distribute to our stockholders each calendar year at least 90% of our net taxable income (excluding net capital gain). To the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income (including net capital gain), we would be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our undistributed net taxable income. In addition, we will incur a 4% non-deductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which our distributions in any calendar year are less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal income tax laws. Although we intend to distribute our net taxable income to our stockholders in a manner intended to satisfy the REIT 90% distribution requirement and to avoid the 4% non-deductible excise tax, it is possible that we, from time to time, may not have sufficient cash to distribute 100% of our net taxable income. There may be timing differences between our actual receipt of cash and the inclusion of items in our income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to distribute net taxable income to stockholders in a manner that satisfies the REIT distribution requirements and avoids the 4% non-deductible excise tax.\n\n\nComplying with the REIT requirements may cause us to forgo and/or liquidate otherwise attractive investments.\n\n\nTo qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal tax purposes, we must continually satisfy various requirements concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders, and the ownership of shares. Among other requirements, to qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy certain annual gross income tests and we must ensure that, at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of our total assets consists of cash, cash items, U.S. government securities and qualified real estate assets. The remainder of our investment in securities generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer (other than U.S. government securities, securities of corporations that are treated as TRSs and qualified real estate assets) or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer (other than government securities, securities of corporations that are treated as TRSs and qualified real estate assets). In addition, in general, no more than 5% of the value of our assets can consist of the securities of any one issuer (other than U.S. government securities, securities of corporations that are treated as TRSs and qualified real estate assets), no more than 20% of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more TRSs and no more than 25% of the value of our assets can consist of debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs that are not otherwise secured by real property. If we fail to comply with these asset requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences.\n \n\n\nTo meet these tests, we may be required to take or forgo taking actions that we would otherwise consider advantageous. For instance, in order to satisfy the gross income or asset tests applicable to REITs under the Code, we\n \n\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nmay be required to forgo investments that we otherwise would make. Furthermore, we may be required to liquidate from our portfolio otherwise attractive investments. In addition, we may be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. These actions could reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to stockholders. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our investment performance.\n\n\nWe may be subject to a 100% tax on income from \u201cprohibited transactions,\u201d and this tax may limit our ability to sell assets or require us to restructure certain of our activities in order to avoid being subject to the tax.\n\n\nWe are subject to a 100% tax on any income from a prohibited transaction. \u201cProhibited transactions\u201d generally include sales or other dispositions of property (other than property treated as foreclosure property under the Code) that is held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business by a REIT, either directly or indirectly through certain pass-through subsidiaries. The characterization of an asset sale as a prohibited transaction depends on the particular facts and circumstances.\n\n\nThe 100% tax will not apply to gains from the sale of inventory that is held through a TRS or other taxable corporation, although such income will be subject to tax in the hands of the corporation at regular corporate income tax rates. We have sold items such as locks, boxes, and packing materials to tenants and third parties directly rather than through a TRS, and as a result could be liable for this tax with respect to these sales. To the extent that we continue to sell such inventory items, other than through a TRS, we may be subject to this 100% tax.\n\n\nOur TRSs will be subject to U.S. federal income tax and will be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on certain income or deductions if transactions with such TRSs are not conducted on arm\u2019s length terms.\n\n\nWe conduct certain activities (such as selling packing supplies and locks and renting trucks or other moving equipment) through one or more TRSs.\n\n\nA TRS is a corporation other than a REIT in which a REIT directly or indirectly holds stock, and that has made a joint election with such REIT to be treated as a TRS. If a TRS owns more than 35% of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of another corporation, such other corporation will also be treated as a TRS. Other than some activities relating to lodging and health care properties, a TRS may generally engage in any business, including the provision of customary or non-customary services to tenants of its parent REIT. A TRS is subject to U.S. federal income tax as a regular C corporation.\n\n\nNo more than 20% of the value of a REIT\u2019s total assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRSs. This requirement limits the extent to which we can conduct our activities through TRSs. The values of some of our assets, including assets that we hold through TRSs, may not be subject to precise determination, and values are subject to change in the future. In addition, the Code imposes a 100% tax on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm\u2019s length basis. We intend to structure transactions with any TRS on terms that we believe are arm\u2019s length to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above. There can be no assurances, however, that we will be able to avoid application of the 100% tax.\n\n\nWe may not have cash available to make distributions.\n\n\nOur taxable income may exceed our cash flow for a year, which could necessitate our borrowing funds and/or subject us to tax, thus reducing the cash available for distribution to our stockholders. We intend to make cash distributions each year sufficient to satisfy REIT distribution requirements and to avoid liability for the REIT excise tax. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to do so. Our taxable income may substantially exceed our net income as determined based on GAAP, as well as our cash flow, because, for example, realized capital losses will be deducted in determining GAAP net income but may not be deductible in computing taxable income or because we acquired assets that generate taxable income in excess of economic income or in advance of the corresponding cash flow from the assets. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cTCJA\u201d), which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, we generally will be required to recognize certain amounts in income no later than the time such amounts are reflected on our financial statements. Also, in certain circumstances our ability to deduct interest expenses for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be limited by provisions of the TCJA. If the cash flow we generate in a particular year is less than our taxable income, we may be required to use cash reserves, incur short-term, or possibly long-term, debt or liquidate non-cash assets at rates or at times that are unfavorable in order to make the necessary distributions.\n\n\nOur REIT qualification could be adversely affected by the REIT qualification of any REIT in which we hold an interest.\n\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn connection with our conversion from a regulated investment company (a \u201cRIC\u201d) to a REIT, we disposed of the majority of our assets and acquired government securities and shares of publicly traded REITs. As a result, our qualification as a REIT has depended on the REIT qualification of the publicly traded REITs in which we have invested. Furthermore, we may continue to hold interests in publicly traded REITs, and as a result our REIT qualification may continue to depend on the REIT qualification of any publicly traded REITs in which we continue to hold an interest. We do not generally independently investigate the REIT qualification of such REITs, but rather generally rely on statements made by such REITs in their public filings. In the event that one or more of the publicly traded REITs in which we invested was not properly treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or if our interests in these REITs were otherwise not treated as equity in a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is possible that we may not have met certain of the REIT asset and income requirements, in which case we could have failed to qualify as a REIT. Similarly, if we hold an interest in a publicly traded REIT in the future that fails to qualify as a REIT, such failure could adversely impact our REIT qualification.\n \n\n\nWe could fail to qualify as a REIT if we have not distributed any earnings and profits attributable to a taxable year before we elected to be taxed as a REIT.\n\n\nA corporation does not qualify as a REIT for a given taxable year if, as of the final day of the taxable year, the corporation has any undistributed earnings and profits that accumulated during a period that the corporation was not treated as a REIT. Because we were not treated as a REIT for our entire existence (such period prior to our election to be taxed as a REIT, the \u201cPre-REIT period\u201d), it is possible that we could have undistributed earnings and profits from the Pre-REIT period, in which case we would be required to pay a deficiency dividend in order to comply with this requirement or could fail to qualify as a REIT. We believe that, since December 31, 2013, we have not had any earnings and profits accumulated from the Pre-REIT period because all such earnings and profits were distributed prior to December 31, 2013. In particular, prior to December 31, 2013, we believe that we qualified as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and as a RIC, we distributed our earnings on an annual basis in order to avoid being subject to U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed earnings. However, if it is determined that we have accumulated earnings and profits from the Pre-REIT period, we could be required to pay a deficiency dividend to stockholders after the relevant determination in order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, or we could fail to qualify as a REIT.\n\n\nWe may not have satisfied requirements related to the ownership of our outstanding stock, which could cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT.\n\n\nIn order to qualify as a REIT, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, through the application of certain attribution rules under the Code, by five or fewer individuals, as defined in the Code to include specified entities, during the last half of any taxable year other than the first taxable year during which we qualified as a REIT (the \u201c5/50 Test\u201d). Prior to October 20, 2017, our charter did not contain customary REIT ownership restrictions and therefore did not ensure that we satisfied the 5/50 Test. Effective as of October 20, 2017, our charter was revised to include, among other things, certain customary ownership limitations that prohibit, among other limitations, any person from beneficially or constructively owning more than 9.8% in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding share of our common stock or all classes and series of our capital stock. These provisions are intended to assist us in satisfying the 5/50 Test. With respect to the period between January 1, 2013 and October 20, 2017, we monitored purchases and transfers of shares of our common stock by regularly reviewing, among other things, ownership filings required by the federal securities laws to monitor the beneficial ownership of our shares in an attempt to ensure that we met the 5/50 Test. However, the attribution rules under the Code are broad, and we may not have had the information necessary to ascertain with certainty whether or not we satisfied the 5/50 Test during such period. As a result, no assurance can be provided that we satisfied the 5/50 Test during such period. If it were determined that we failed to satisfy the 5/50 Test, we could fail to qualify as a REIT or, assuming we qualify for a statutory relief provision under the Code, be required to pay a penalty tax.\n\n\nComplying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.\n\n\nThe REIT provisions of the Code may limit our ability to hedge our assets and operations. Under these provisions, any income that we generate from transactions intended to hedge interest rate risk will be excluded from gross income for purposes of the REIT 75% and 95% gross income tests if (i) the instrument (a) hedges interest rate risk on liabilities used to carry or acquire real estate assets or (b) hedges an instrument described in clause (a) for a period following the extinguishment of the liability or the disposition of the asset that was previously hedged by the hedged instrument, and (ii) the relevant instrument is properly identified under applicable Treasury regulations.\n \n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIncome from hedging transactions that do not meet these requirements will generally constitute non-qualifying income for purposes of both the REIT 75% and 95% gross income tests. As a result of these rules, we may have to limit our use of hedging techniques that might otherwise be advantageous or implement those hedges through a TRS. This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our TRS would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear. In addition, losses in our TRS will generally not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried back or forward against past or future taxable income in the TRS.\n\n\nLegislative or regulatory tax changes related to REITs could materially and adversely affect our business.\n\n\nThe U.S. federal income tax laws and regulations governing REITs and their stockholders, as well as the administrative interpretations of those laws and regulations, are constantly under review and may be changed at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. No assurance can be given as to whether, when, or in what form, the U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to us and our stockholders may be enacted. Changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws and interpretations of U.S. federal tax laws could adversely affect an investment in our common stock.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, the TCJA, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, significantly changed U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to businesses and their owners, including REITs and their stockholders, and have lessened the relative competitive advantage of operating as a REIT rather than as a C corporation. For additional discussion, see \u201cRecent U.S. Federal Income Tax Legislation.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe future sales of shares of our common stock may depress the price of our common stock and dilute stockholders\u2019 beneficial ownership.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe cannot predict whether future issuances of shares of our common stock or the availability of shares of our common stock for resale in the open market will decrease the market price of our common stock. Any sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales might occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, future issuances of our common stock may be dilutive to existing stockholders.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAny future offerings of debt, which would be senior to our common stock upon liquidation, and/or preferred equity securities which may be senior to our common stock for purposes of dividend distributions or upon liquidation, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\n\n\nIn the future, we may increase our capital resources by making offerings of debt or preferred equity securities, including trust preferred securities, senior or subordinated notes and preferred stock. Upon liquidation, holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive distributions of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our common stock, or both. Holders of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their stock holdings in us.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may vary substantially.\n\n\nOur common stock is listed on NASDAQ under the symbol \u201cSELF.\u201d The stock markets, including NASDAQ, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations over the past several years. As a result, the market price of our common stock is likely to be similarly volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. Accordingly, no\n \n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nassurance can be given as to the ability of our stockholders to sell their common stock or the price that our stockholders may obtain for their common stock.\n\n\nSome of the factors that could negatively affect the market price of our common stock include:\n\n\n\u2022\nour actual or projected operating results, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity or changes in business strategy or prospects;\n\n\n\u2022\nactual or perceived conflicts of interest with our directors, officers and employees;\n\n\n\u2022\nequity issuances by us, or share resales by our stockholders, or the perception that such issuances or resales may occur;\n\n\n\u2022\nthe impact of accounting principles and policies on our financial positions and results;\n\n\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us or the real estate industry;\n\n\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\n\n\u2022\nadverse market reaction to any increased indebtedness we may incur in the future;\n\n\n\u2022\nadditions to or departures of our key personnel;\n\n\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\n\n\u2022\nour failure to meet, or the lowering of, our earnings estimates or those of any securities analysts;\n\n\n\u2022\nincreases in market interest rates, which may lead investors to demand a higher distribution yield for our common stock and would result in increased interest expenses on our debt;\n\n\n\u2022\nfailure to maintain our REIT qualification or exclusion from registration under the 1940 Act, as amended;\n\n\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the stock market generally; and\n\n\n\u2022\ngeneral market and economic conditions, including the current state of the credit and capital markets.\n\n\nMarket factors unrelated to our performance could also negatively impact the market price of our common stock. One of the factors that investors may consider in deciding whether to buy or sell our common stock is our distribution rate as a percentage of our stock price relative to market interest rates. If market interest rates increase, prospective investors may demand a higher distribution rate or seek alternative investments paying higher dividends or interest. As a result, interest rate fluctuations and conditions in capital markets can affect the market value of our common stock. For instance, if interest rates rise, it is likely that the market price of our common stock will decrease as market rates on interest-bearing securities increase.\n\n", "item7": ">Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of \nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\n\nCAUTIONARY LANGUAGE\n\n\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our selected consolidated historical financial data together with the consolidated pro forma financial data and historical financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report. We make statements in this section that may be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section in this annual report entitled \u201cStatement on Forward-looking Information.\u201d\n\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). Our notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report describe the significant accounting policies essential to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Preparation of our financial statements requires estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions that we have used are appropriate and correct based on information available at the time they were made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect our reported assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the period presented. If there are material differences between these estimates, judgments and assumptions and actual facts, our financial statements may be affected.\n\n\nIn many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require our judgment in its application. There are areas in which our judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result, but there are some areas in which our judgment in selecting among available alternatives would produce a materially different result. See the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements that contain additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures.\n\n\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis Overview\n\n\nThe Company is a self-administered and self-managed REIT that owns, operates, manages, acquires, and redevelops self storage properties (\u201cstores\u201d or \u201cproperties\u201d) in the United States. Our stores are designed to offer affordable, easily accessible and secure storage space for residential and commercial customers. As of December 31, 2021, the Company owned and operated, or managed, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, thirteen stores located in Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Oklahoma. The Company was formerly registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d) as a non-diversified, closed end management investment company. The Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (\u201cSEC\u201d) order approving the Company\u2019s application to deregister from the 1940 Act was granted on January 19, 2016. On January 19, 2016, the Company changed its name to Global Self Storage, Inc. from Self Storage Group, Inc., changed its SEC registration from an investment company to an operating company reporting under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and listed its common stock on NASDAQ under the symbol \u201cSELF\u201d.\n\n\nThe Company was incorporated on December 12, 1996 under the laws of the state of Maryland. The Company has elected to be treated as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). To the extent the Company continues to qualify as a REIT, it will not generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax, with certain limited exceptions, on its taxable income that is distributed to its stockholders.\n\n\nOur store operations generated most of our net income for all periods presented herein. Accordingly, a significant portion of management\u2019s time is devoted to seeking to maximize cash flows from our existing stores, as well as seeking investments in additional stores. The Company expects to continue to earn a majority of its gross income from its store operations as its current store operations continue to develop and as it makes additional store acquisitions. Over time, the Company expects to divest its remaining portfolio of investment securities and use the proceeds to acquire and operate additional stores. The Company expects its income from investment securities to continue to decrease as it continues to divest its holdings of investment securities.\n\n\n36\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n\nOur financing strategy is to minimize the cost of our capital in order to maximize the returns generated for our stockholders. For future acquisitions, the Company may continue to use various financing and capital raising alternatives including, but not limited to, debt and/or equity offerings, credit facilities, mortgage financing, and joint ventures with third parties.\n\n\nOn June 24, 2016, certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries (\u201cTerm Loan Secured Subsidiaries\u201d) entered into a loan agreement and certain other related agreements (collectively, the \u201cTerm Loan Agreement\u201d) between the Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries and Insurance Strategy Funding IV, LLC (the \u201cTerm Loan Lender\u201d). Under the Term Loan Agreement, the Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries borrowed from Term Loan Lender the principal amount of $20 million pursuant to a promissory note (the \u201cTerm Loan Promissory Note\u201d). The Term Loan Promissory Note bears interest at a rate equal to 4.192% per annum and is due to mature on July 1, 2036. Pursuant to a security agreement (the \u201cTerm Loan Security Agreement\u201d), the obligations under the Term Loan Agreement are secured by certain real estate assets owned by the Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries. J.P. Morgan Investment Management, Inc. acted as Special Purpose Vehicle Agent of the Term Loan Lender. We entered into a non-recourse guaranty (the \u201cTerm Loan Guaranty\u201d and together with the Term Loan Agreement, the Term Loan Promissory Note and the Term Loan Security Agreement, the \u201cTerm Loan Documents\u201d) on June 24, 2016 to guarantee the payment to the Term Loan Lender of certain obligations of the Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries under the Term Loan Agreement. We have used some of the proceeds from the Term Loan Agreement to acquire four additional self storage properties.\n \n\n\nOn December 20, 2018, certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries (\u201cCredit Facility Secured Subsidiaries\u201d) entered into a revolving credit loan agreement (collectively, the \u201cCredit Facility Loan Agreement\u201d) between the Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries and TCF National Bank (\u201cCredit Facility Lender\u201d). Under the Credit Facility Loan Agreement, the Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries may borrow from the Credit Facility Lender in the principal amount of up to $10 million pursuant to a promissory note (the \u201cCredit Facility Promissory Note\u201d). The Credit Facility Promissory Note bears an interest rate equal to 3.00% over the One Month U.S. Dollar London Inter-Bank Offered Rate and was due to mature on December 20, 2021. The obligations under the Credit Facility Loan Agreement are secured by certain real estate assets owned by the Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries. We entered into a guaranty of payment on December 20, 2018 (the \u201cCredit Facility Guaranty,\u201d and together with the Credit Facility Loan Agreement, the Credit Facility Promissory Note and related instruments, the \u201cCredit Facility Loan Documents\u201d) to guarantee the payment to the Credit Facility Lender of certain obligations of the Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries under the Credit Facility Loan Agreement. As described in more detail below, the Credit Facility Loan Agreement has been replaced in its entirety by the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement on July 6, 2021.\n\n\nOn December 18, 2019, we completed a rights offering whereby we sold and issued an aggregate of 1,601,291 shares of our common stock (\u201ccommon stock\u201d) at the subscription price of $4.18 per whole share of common stock, pursuant to the exercise of subscriptions and oversubscriptions from our stockholders. We raised aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $6.7 million in the rights offering.\n\n\nOn May 19, 2020, Midas Management Corporation (\u201cMMC\u201d) (the \u201cBorrower\u201d) entered into a Paycheck Protection Program Term Note (\u201cPPP Note\u201d) with Customers Bank on behalf of itself and Winmill & Co. Incorporated, Bexil Corporation, Tuxis Corporation, and/or their affiliates (collectively with the Company, the \u201cAffiliates\u201d) under the Paycheck Protection Program (the \u201cProgram\u201d) of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the \u201cSBA\u201d). Certain officers and directors of the Company also serve as officers and/or directors of the Affiliates. Pursuant to an arrangement between a professional employer organization and the Affiliates, MMC acts as a conduit payer of compensation and benefits to the Affiliates\u2019 employees including those who are concurrently employed by the Company and its Affiliates. The Borrower received total proceeds of $486,602 from the PPP Note of which approximately $300,000 was attributable to the Company under the SBA\u2019s loan determination formula. In accordance with the requirements of the CARES Act, the Affiliates used the proceeds from the PPP Note primarily for payroll and other eligible costs. Interest accrues on the PPP Note at the rate per annum of 1.00%. In March 2021, the Borrower applied to Customers Bank for forgiveness of the amount due on the PPP Note in an amount equal to the sum of payroll and other eligible costs incurred during the Covered Period, as defined therein, following disbursement under the PPP Note.\n\n\nOn October 8, 2021, the Borrower received the SBA\u2019s final loan review decision which denied forgiveness of the loan in full. On November 4, 2021, the Borrower filed an appeal petition with the SBA\u2019s Office of Hearings and Appeals within the 30 calendar day period after receipt of the final loan review decision. The Borrower's timely filing\n \n\n\n37\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nof the appeal has extended the loan deferment period. On January 25, 2022, the SBA\u2019s Office of Hearings and Appeals dismissed Borrower's appeal petition without prejudice and remanded the matter to the SBA for further review of loan forgiveness. The loan deferment period has been extended until the SBA reaches a conclusion on loan forgiveness. We cannot predict how long it will take the SBA to complete its review or provide assurance that we will obtain forgiveness of our portion of the PPP Note in whole or in part. If forgiveness is not granted, we will need to repay interest on our portion of the PPP Note.\n\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, there has been no material impact to our operations or cash flows due to the PPP Note. If and when the PPP Note is, in part or wholly forgiven, and legal release is received, we expect to record a gain in an amount proportionate to our share of payroll costs and other eligible expenses incurred during the Covered Period. We expect the loan forgiveness to reduce such expenses and reduce related reimbursements to MMC and Winco accordingly.\n\n\nOn June 25, 2021, we completed an underwritten public offering whereby we sold and issued an aggregate of 1,121,496 shares of our common stock at the price of $5.35 per share. Subsequently, the over-allotment option was exercised increasing the total number of shares sold and issued to 1,289,720. We raised aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $6.9 million in the public offering after giving effect to the exercise of the over-allotment option.\n\n\nOn July 6, 2021, certain wholly owned subsidiaries (\u201cAmended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries\u201d) of the Company entered into a first amendment to the Credit Facility Loan Agreement (collectively, the \u201cAmended Credit Facility Loan Agreement\u201d) between the Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries and The Huntington National Bank, successor by merger to TCF National Bank (\u201cAmended Credit Facility Lender\u201d). Under the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement, the Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries may borrow from the Amended Credit Facility Lender in the principal amount of up to $15 million pursuant to a promissory note (the \u201cAmended Credit Facility Promissory Note\u201d). The Amended Credit Facility Promissory Note bears an interest rate equal to 3% plus the greater of the One Month U.S. Dollar London Inter-Bank Offered Rate or one-quarter of one percent (0.25%) and is due to mature on July 6, 2024. As of December 31, 2021, the effective interest rate was 3.25%. The obligations under the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement are secured by certain real estate assets owned by the Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries. The Company entered into an amended and restated guaranty of payment on July 6, 2021 (\u201cAmended Credit Facility Guaranty,\u201d and together with the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement, the Amended Credit Facility Promissory Note and related instruments, the \u201cAmended Credit Facility Loan Documents\u201d) to guarantee the payment to the Amended Credit Facility Lender of certain obligations of the Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries under the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement. The Company and the Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries paid customary fees and expenses in connection with their entry into the Amended Credit Facility Loan Documents. The Company also maintains a bank account at the Amended Credit Facility Lender. As of December 31, 2021, we have no withdrawn proceeds under the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement. We currently intend to strategically withdraw proceeds available under the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement to fund: (i) the acquisition of additional self storage properties, (ii) expansions at existing self storage properties in our portfolio, and/or (iii) joint ventures with third parties for the acquisition and expansion of self storage properties.\n \n\n\nOn January 14, 2022, the Company entered into an At Market Offering Sales Agreement (the \u201cSales Agreement\u201d) with B. Riley Securities, Inc. (the \u201cAge\nnt\u201d) pursuant to which the Company may sell, from time to time, shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to $15,000,000, through the Agent. \nAs of the date of this filing\n, under the Sales Agreement, the Company has sold and issued an aggregate of 65,843 shares of our common stock and raised aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $403,364, less sales commissions of approximately $8,069.\n\n\nW\ne continue to actively review a number of store and store portfolio acquisition opportunities and have been working to further develop and expand our current stores. We did not make any acquisitions in the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, we may pursue third-party management opportunities of properties owned by certain affiliates or joint venture partners for a fee, and utilize such relationships with third-party owners as a source for future acquisitions and investment opportunities. As of December 31, 2021, we managed one third-party owned property, which was rebranded as \u201cGlobal Self Storage,\u201d had 137,118-leasable square feet and was comprised of 618 climate-controlled and non-climate-controlled units located in Edmond, Oklahoma.\n\n\n38\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition to actively reviewing a number of store and portfolio acquisition opportunities, we have been working to further develop and expand our current stores.\n \n\n\nIn 2021, the Company began reviewing plans to convert certain commercially-leased space to 3,000 leasable square feet of all-climate-controlled units at the Lima, OH property. In July 2021, the Company completed such conversion, resulting in a new total of 756 units and 96,883 leasable square feet at the Lima, OH property. Upon completion, total area occupancy was approximately 94.8%. As of \nDecember 31, 2021\n, the Lima, OH store\u2019s total area occupancy was approximately 95.7%. This conversion did not constitute a significant renovation or expansion because it only added approximately 3,000 leasable square feet of self storage to the property. As such, our Lima, OH property remained a same store property.\n\n\nWe expect we will have sufficient cash from current sources to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months because our capital resources currently exceed our projected expenses for the next twelve months. However, we may opt to supplement our equity capital and increase potential returns to our stockholders through the use of prudent levels of borrowings.  We may use debt when the available terms and conditions are favorable to long-term investing and well-aligned with our business plan. In light of the novel coronavirus (\u201c\nCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic\n and its impact on the global economy, we are closely monitoring overall liquidity levels and changes in our business performance (including our properties) to be in a position to enact changes to ensure adequate liquidity going forward.\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had capital resources totaling approximately $21.5 million, comprised of $3.0 million of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, $3.5 million of marketable securities, and $15.0 million available for withdrawal under the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement. Capital resources derived from retained cash flow have been and are currently expected to continue to be negligible. Retained operating cash flow represents our expected cash flow provided by operating activities, less stockholder distributions and capital expenditures to maintain stores. These capital resources allow us to continue to execute our strategic business plan, which includes funding acquisitions, either directly or through joint ventures; expansion projects at our existing properties; and broadening our revenue base and pipeline of potential acquisitions through developing Global MaxManagement\nSM\n, our third-party management platform. Our board of directors regularly reviews our strategic business plan, including topics and metrices like capital formation, debt versus equity ratios, dividend policy, use of capital and debt, funds from operations (\u201cFFO\u201d) and adjusted funds from operations (\u201cAFFO\u201d) performance, and optimal cash levels.\n\n\nWe expect that the results of our operations will be affected by a number of factors. Many of the factors that will affect our operating results are beyond our control. The Company and its properties could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to an epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic \nhas continued to impact the U.S. and global economies. The U.S. financial markets have experienced disruption and constrained credit conditions within certain sectors. Although more normalized activities have resumed, at this time the Company cannot predict the full extent of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company and the COVID-19 pandemic could have a delayed adverse impact on the Company's financial results. The Company will continue to monitor the pandemic's effects and will adjust its operations as necessary.\n \n\n\nAs of the date of this annual report, our properties continue to operate and we are in compliance with federal, state and local COVID-19 guidelines and mandates. In addition, we continue practicing social distancing and enhanced cleaning and disinfectant activities to protect our employees and tenants. We have long provided online leasing and payment options, as well as on-site contactless solutions using kiosks that can facilitate rentals and even automatically dispense locks. Our kiosks are available 24/7 at each of our stores where prospective tenants can select and rent a unit, or current tenants can pay their rent.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nResults of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2020\n\n\nRevenues\n\n\nTotal revenues increased from $9,196,524 during the year ended December 31, 2020 to $10,508,830 during the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 14.3% or $\u202d1,312,306\u202c.

These costs primarily consisted of consulting costs in connection with business development, capital raising, and future potential store acquisitions, and expenses related to our third party management platform marketing initiatives. The majority of these expenses are non-recurring and fluctuate based on business development activity during the time period.\n\n\nOperating Income\n\n\nOperating income increased from $1,220,212 during the year ended December 31, 2020 to $2,684,960 during the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 120.0% or $\u202d1,464,748, which was primarily due to increased total revenues.\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOther income (expense)\n\n\nInterest expense on loans decreased from $1,180,341 during the year ended December 31, 2020 to $1,046,461 during the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of 11.3% or $133,880. This increase was primarily attributable to decreased borrowings under our Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n\nDividend and interest income was $76,021 during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $79,331 during the year ended December 31, 2020.\n \n\n\nThe Company recognizes changes in the fair value of its investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values in net income and, as such, recorded an unrealized gain of $1,566,731 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $155,139 during the year ended December 31, 2020.\n \n\n\nNet income (loss)\n\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, net income was $3,281,251 or $0.33 per fully diluted share. For the year ended December 31, 2020, net income was $274,341 or $0.03 per fully diluted share.\n \n\n\nNon-GAAP Measures\n\n\nFunds from Operations (\u201cFFO\u201d) and FFO per share are non-GAAP measures defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\u201cNAREIT\u201d) and are considered helpful measures of REIT performance\n \n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nby REITs and many REIT analysts. NAREIT defines FFO as a REIT\u2019s net income, excluding gains or losses from sales of property, and adding back real estate depreciation and amortization. FFO and FFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. FFO is not a substitute for GAAP net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends, because it excludes financing activities presented on our statements of cash flows. In addition, other REITs may compute these measures differently, so comparisons among REITs may not be helpful. However, the Company believes that to further understand the performance of its stores, FFO should be considered along with the net income and cash flows reported in accordance with GAAP and as presented in the Company\u2019s financial statements.\n\n\nAdjusted FFO (\u201cAFFO\u201d) and AFFO per share are non-GAAP measures that represents FFO and FFO per share excluding the effects of business development, capital raising, and acquisition related costs and non-recurring items, which we believe are not indicative of the Company\u2019s operating results. AFFO and AFFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. AFFO is not a substitute for GAAP net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends, because it excludes financing activities presented on our statements of cash flows. We present AFFO because we believe it is a helpful measure in understanding our results of operations insofar as we believe that the items noted above that are included in FFO, but excluded from AFFO, are not indicative of our ongoing operating results. We also believe that the analyst community considers our AFFO (or similar measures using different terminology) when evaluating us. Because other REITs or real estate companies may not compute AFFO in the same manner as we do, and may use different terminology, our computation of AFFO may not be comparable to AFFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies. However, the Company believes that to further understand the performance of its stores, AFFO should be considered along with the net income and cash flows reported in accordance with GAAP and as presented in the Company\u2019s financial statements.\n\n\nWe believe net operating income or \u201cNOI\u201d is a meaningful measure of operating performance because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to, among other things, capital allocations, determining current store values, evaluating store performance, and in comparing period-to-period and market-to-market store operating results. In addition, we believe the investment community utilizes NOI in determining operating performance and real estate values, and does not consider depreciation expense because it is based upon historical cost. NOI is defined as net store earnings before general and administrative expenses, interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.\n\n\nNOI is not a substitute for net income, net operating cash flow, or other related GAAP financial measures, in evaluating our operating results.\n\n\nSame-Store Self Storage Operations\n\n\nWe consider our same-store portfolio to consist of only those stores owned and operated on a stabilized basis at the beginning and at the end of the applicable periods presented. We consider a store to be stabilized once it has achieved an occupancy rate that we believe, based on our assessment of market-specific data, is representative of similar self storage assets in the applicable market for a full year measured as of the most recent January 1 and has not been significantly damaged by natural disaster or undergone significant renovation or expansion. We believe that same-store results are useful to investors in evaluating our performance because they provide information relating to changes in store-level operating performance without taking into account the effects of acquisitions, dispositions or new ground-up developments. At December 31, 2021, we owned nine same-store properties and three non-same-store properties. The Company believes that by providing same-store results from a stabilized pool of stores, with accompanying operating metrics including, but not limited to, variances in occupancy, rental revenue, operating expenses, NOI, etc., stockholders and potential investors are able to evaluate operating performance without the effects of non-stabilized occupancy levels, rent levels, expense levels, acquisitions or completed developments. Same-store results should not be used as a basis for future same-store performance or for the performance of the Company\u2019s stores as a whole.\n\n\nSame-store occupancy for the three months and year ended December 31, 2021 decreased by 100 basis points to 94.1% from 95.1% for the same period in 2020.\n \n\n\nWe grew our top-line results by increasing same-store revenues by 15.0% for the three months ended December 31, 2021 versus the three months ended December 31, 2020, and by 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus the year ended December 31, 2020. Same-store cost of operations increased by 6.4% for the three months\n \n\n\n41\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nended December 31, 2021 versus the three months ended December 31, 2020, and increased by 4.4% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 versus the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Same-store NOI increased by 20.1% for the three months ended December 31, 2021 versus the three months ended December 31, 2020, and increased 15.5% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 versus the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The increase in same-store NOI was due primarily to an increase in revenues.\n \n\n\nWe believe that our results were driven by, among other things, our internet and digital marketing initiatives which helped maintain our overall average same-store occupancy in the 94% range as of December 31, 2021. Also, contributing to our results were our customer service efforts which we believe were essential in building local brand loyalty resulting in powerful referral and word-of-mouth market demand for our storage units and services. Another significant contributing factor to our results was our success in controlling \nstore-level cost of operations, maximizing tenant occupancy, and limiting the decrease in revenues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic\n.\n\n\nThese results are summarized as follows:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSAME -

These increases were \nattributable to, among other things, consistent rent collections, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, increased rental rates\n, and the results of our revenue rate management program of raising existing tenant rates. Same store average overall square foot occupancy for all of the Company\u2019s same-stores combined decreased by 100 basis points to 94.1% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 from 95.1% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\n \n\n\nWe believe that our focus on high occupancy helps us to maximize rental income at our properties. We seek to maintain an average square foot occupancy level at or above 90% by regularly adjusting the rental rates and promotions offered to attract new tenants as well as adjusting our online marketing efforts in seeking to generate sufficient move-in volume to replace tenants that vacate. Demand may fluctuate due to various local and regional factors, including the overall economy. Demand is generally higher in the summer months than in the winter months and, as a result, rental rates charged to new tenants are typically higher in the summer months than in the winter months.\n\n\nDuring the period from late March 2020 through May 2020, we experienced reduced activity with fewer move-ins and move-outs, and received periodic tenant requests for the waiver of late fees due to COVID-19 related hardships. However, we have seen increased demand for self storage since June 2020, as various areas of the United States emerged from stay at home orders. These trends may be temporary or even reverse, to the extent they are driven by short-term factors such as stay at home orders and delays in our auction process. We temporarily suspended our existing tenant rental rate increase program, but have since restarted it at all of our properties as of July 2020. This temporary suspension impacted our revenue. Because existing tenant rental rate increases have contributed significantly to increases in rental income in recent years, further suspension of these increases may have a material adverse impact on our revenue growth. Also, it is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic could change consumer behavior, either due to economic recession, uncertainty, or dislocation, as well as other factors, which could increase customer sensitivity and propensity to move-out in response to rate increases, either in the short or longer term. Other\n \n\n\n43\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\neffects of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as movement from urban areas to more suburban and rural areas, has driven increased demand for self storage in the secondary and tertiary markets that we operate.\n \n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we observed no material degradation in rent collections. However, we believe that our bad debt losses (which are reflected as a reduction in revenues) could increase from historical levels, due to (i) cumulative stress on our customers\u2019 financial capacity and (ii) reduced rent recoveries from auctioned units.\n \n\n\nWe may experience a change in the move-out patterns of our long-term customers due to economic uncertainty and the significant increase in unemployment recently. This could lead to lower occupancies and rent \u201croll down\u201d as long-term customers are replaced with new customers at lower rates.\n \n\n\nIf and when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, we currently expect rental income growth, if any, to come from a combination of the following: (i) continued existing tenant rent increases, (ii) higher rental rates charged to new tenants, (iii) lower promotional discounts, and (iv) higher occupancies. Our future rental income growth will likely also be dependent upon many factors for each market that we operate in, including, among other things, demand for self storage space, the level of competitor supply of self storage space, and the average length of stay of our tenants. Increasing existing tenant rental rates, generally on an annual basis, is a key component of our revenue growth. We typically determine the level of rental increases based upon our expectations regarding the impact of existing tenant rate increases on incremental move-outs. We currently expect existing tenant rent increases for 2022, if any, to be similar to those for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n\nDue to the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is difficult to predict trends in move-in, move-out, in place contractual rents, and occupancy levels. Current trends, when viewed in the short-term, are volatile and not necessarily predictive of our revenues going forward because they may be subject to many short-term factors. Such factors include, among others, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, initial move-in rates, seasonal factors, unit size and geographical mix of the specific tenants moving in or moving out, the length of stay of the tenants moving in or moving out, changes in our pricing strategies, and the degree and timing of rate increases previously passed to existing tenants.\n\n\nImportantly, we continue to refine our ongoing revenue rate management program which includes regular internet data scraping of local competitors\u2019 prices. We do this in seeking to maintain our competitive market price advantage for our various sized storage units at our stores. This program helps us in seeking to maximize each store\u2019s occupancies and our self storage revenue and NOI. We believe that, through our various marketing initiatives, we can continue to attract high quality, long term tenants who we expect will be storing with us for years. As of December 31, 2021, our average tenant duration of stay was approximately 3.3 years, up from approximately 3.0 years as of December 31, 2020.\n\n\nAnalysis of Same-Store Cost of Operations\n\n\nSame-store cost of operations increased 6.4% or $45,222 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 versus the three months ended December 31, 2020, and increased 4.4% or $127,048 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 versus the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. This increase in same-store cost of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 was due primarily to increased expenses for landscaping from snow removal, repairs and maintenance, credit card fees, real estate taxes, utilities, IT maintenance and support, and travel.\n \n \n\n\nEmployment.\n  On-site store manager, regional manager and district payroll expense decreased 10.7% or $24,381 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 versus the three months ended December 31, 2020, and decreased 3.5% or $31,722 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. This decrease was due primarily to routine employee departures. We currently expect inflationary increases in compensation rates for existing employees and other increases in compensation costs as we potentially add new stores as well as district, regional, and store managers.\n\n\nReal Estate Property Tax.\n  Store property tax expense increased 6.4% or $18,032 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 versus the three months ended December 31, 2020, and increased 2.2% or $24,306 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. The increase in property tax expense\n \n\n\n44\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nduring the year ended December 31, 2021 is primarily due to increased property assessment valuations and the loss of our Class 8 tax incentive granted to SSG Dolton LLC. See the section titled \u201cProperty Tax Expenses at Dolton, IL\u201d for additional detail. We currently expect same-store property tax expenses to increase during 2022, primarily due to an expected phaseout of the Class 8 tax incentive granted to SSG Dolton LLC and increased property assessment valuations.\n\n\nAdministrative.\n  We classify administrative expenses as bank charges related to processing the stores\u2019 cash receipts, credit card fees, repairs and maintenance, utilities, landscaping, alarm monitoring and trash removal. Administrative expenses increased 21.7% or $24,972 in the three months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020, and increased 23.2% or $107,464 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. We experienced an increase in administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2021 due primarily to increased repairs and maintenance, utilities, credit card fees, and landscaping expense. Credit card fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2021 due to a higher proportion of rental payments being received through credit cards, which is one of the results of our initiatives in building a higher quality overall tenant base. We currently expect moderate increases in other direct store costs in 2022.\n\n\nRepairs and maintenance expense increased 100.7% or $19,510 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 versus the three months ended December 31, 2020, and increased 31.7% or $26,184 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 due primarily to certain one-time repairs completed during the year ended 2021.\n \n\n\nOur utility expenses are currently comprised of electricity, oil, and gas costs, which vary by store and are dependent upon energy prices and usage levels. Changes in usage levels are driven primarily by weather and temperature. Also, affecting our utilities expenses over time is our ongoing LED light replacement program at all of our stores which has already resulted in lower electricity usage. Utility expense increased 12.4% or $4,243 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 versus the three months ended December 31, 2020, and increased 8.5% or $13,206 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due \nto rising costs for energy and higher energy usage at most of our stores during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021 versus the same periods in 2020\n. It is difficult to estimate future utility costs because weather, temperature, and energy prices are volatile and unpredictable. However, based upon current trends and expectations regarding commercial electricity rates, we currently expect inflationary increases in rates combined with lower usage resulting in higher net utility costs in 2022.\n\n\nLandscaping expenses, which include snow removal costs, decreased 29.4% or $7,395 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 versus the three months ended December 31, 2020, and increased 60.4% or $49,048 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. \nThe increase in landscaping expense in the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 versus the same period in 2020 is primarily due to higher snow removal expenses in 2021. \nLandscaping expense levels are dependent upon many factors such as weather conditions, which can impact landscaping needs including, among other things, snow removal, inflation in material and labor costs, and random events. We currently expect inflationary increases in landscaping expense in 2022, excluding snow removal expense, which is primarily weather dependent and unpredictable.\n\n\nMarketing.  \nMarketing expense is comprised principally of internet advertising and the operating costs of our 24/7 kiosk and telephone call and reservation center. Marketing expense varies based upon demand, occupancy levels, and other factors. Internet advertising, in particular, can increase or decrease significantly in the short term in response to these factors. Marketing expense increased 8.4% or $4,133 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 versus the three months ended December 31, 2020, and decreased 8.7% or $17,014 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. \nThe decrease in marketing expense in the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 versus the same period in 2020 is\n \nprimarily due to decreased marketing costs and internet advertising expenses \nduring the year ended 2021. Based upon current trends in move-ins, move-outs, and occupancies, we currently expect marketing expense to increase in 2022.\n\n\nGeneral. \n Other direct store costs include general expenses incurred at the stores. General expenses include items such as store insurance, business license costs, and the cost of operating each store\u2019s rental office including supplies and telephone and data communication lines. General expenses increased 89.7% or $23,044 in the three months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020, and increased 17.4% or $31,505 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to increased expenses for travel and IT maintenance and support.\n \n\n\n45\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLien Administration.  \nLien administration expenses decreased 17.4% or $576 in the three months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020, and decreased 16.6% or $2,489 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. Decreased tenants\u2019 stored items auctions contributed to the decreased expenses. We currently expect moderate increases in other direct store costs in 2022.\n\n\nCombined Same-Store and Non Same-Store Self Storage Operations\n\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we owned nine same-store properties and three non same-store properties. The non same-store properties are McCordsville, IN, Millbrook, NY, and West Henrietta, NY.\n\n\nCombined same-store and non same-store average overall square foot occupancy at the end of the three months and year ended December 31, 2021 decreased by 100 basis points to 93.1% from 94.1% for the same period in 2020. Combined same-store and non same-store occupancy includes all of our properties as of the indicated date, including those that have recently undergone significant expansion or redevelopment, such as our expansions at West Henrietta, NY and Millbrook, NY and our conversion at McCordsville, IN. As a result of the Millbrook, NY expansion construction, certain units at the existing Millbrook, NY property were required to be temporarily vacated.\n \n\n\nWe grew our top-line results by increasing combined same-store and non same-store (\u201cCombined store\u201d) revenues by 16.2% for the three months ended December 31, 2021 versus the three months ended December 31, 2020, and by 14.3% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 versus the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Combined store cost of operations increased by 6.4% for the three months ended December 31, 2021 versus the three months ended December 31, 2020, and increased by 5.3% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 versus the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Combined store NOI increased by 22.1% for the three months ended December 31, 2021 versus the three months ended December 31, 2020, and by 20.1% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 versus the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\n \n\n\nWe believe that our results were driven by, among other things, our internet and digital marketing initiatives which helped maintain our overall average occupancy in the 93% range as of December 31, 2021. Also, contributing to our strong results were our customer service efforts which we believe were essential in building local brand loyalty resulting in referral and word-of-mouth market demand for our storage units and services. Another significant contributing factor to our results was our success in controlling store-level cost of operations, maximizing tenant occupancy, and limiting the decrease in revenues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nThese results are summarized as follows:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCOMBINED SAME -

These increases were \nattributable to, among other things, consistent rent collections, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, increased rental rates\n, and the results of our revenue rate management program of raising existing tenant rates.\n \n\n\nWe believe that our focus on high occupancy helps us to maximize rental income at our properties. We seek to maintain an average square foot occupancy level at or above 90% by regularly adjusting the rental rates and promotions offered to attract new tenants as well as adjusting our online marketing efforts in seeking to generate sufficient move-in volume to replace tenants that vacate. Demand may fluctuate due to various local and regional factors, including the overall economy. Demand is generally higher in the summer months than in the winter months and, as a result, rental rates charged to new tenants are typically higher in the summer months than in the winter months.\n\n\nDuring the period from late March 2020 through May 2020, we experienced reduced activity with fewer move-ins and move-outs, and received periodic tenant requests for the waiver of late fees due to COVID-19 related hardships. However, we have seen increased demand for self storage since June 2020, as various areas of the United States emerged from stay at home orders. These trends may be temporary or even reverse, to the extent they are driven by short-term factors such as stay at home orders and delays in our auction process. We temporarily suspended our existing tenant rental rate increase program, but have since restarted it at all of our properties as of July 2020. This temporary suspension has impacted our revenue. Because existing tenant rental rate increases have contributed significantly to increases in rental income in recent years, further suspension of these increases may have a material adverse impact on our revenue growth. Also, it is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic could change consumer behavior, either due to economic recession, uncertainty, or dislocation, as well as other factors, which could increase customer sensitivity and propensity to move-out in response to rate increases, either in the short or longer term. Other effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as movement from urban areas to more suburban and rural areas, has driven increased demand for self storage in the secondary and tertiary markets that we operate.\n \n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we observed no material degradation in rent collections. However, we believe that our bad debt losses (which are reflected as a reduction in revenues) could increase from historical levels, due to (i) cumulative stress on our customers\u2019 financial capacity and (ii) reduced rent recoveries from auctioned units.\n \n\n\nWe may experience a change in the move-out patterns of our long-term customers due to economic uncertainty and the significant increase in unemployment recently. This could lead to lower occupancies and rent \u201croll down\u201d as long-term customers are replaced with new customers at lower rates.\n \n\n\nIf and when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, we currently expect rental income growth, if any, to come from a combination of the following: (i) continued existing tenant rent increases, (ii) higher rental rates charged to new tenants, (iii) lower promotional discounts, and (iv) higher occupancies. Our future rental income growth will likely also be dependent upon many factors for each market that we operate in, including, among other things, demand for self storage space, the level of competitor supply of self storage space, and the average length of stay of our tenants. Increasing existing tenant rental rates, generally on an annual basis, is a key component of our revenue growth. We typically determine the level of rental increases based upon our expectations regarding the impact of existing tenant rate increases on incremental move-outs. We currently expect existing tenant rent increases for 2022, if any, to be similar to those for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n\nDue to the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is difficult to predict trends in move-in, move-out, in place contractual rents, and occupancy levels. Current trends, when viewed in the short-term, are volatile and not necessarily predictive of our revenues going forward because they may be subject to many short-term factors. Such factors include, among others, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, initial move-in rates, seasonal factors, unit size and geographical mix of the specific tenants moving in or moving out, the length of stay of the tenants moving in or moving out, changes in our pricing strategies, and the degree and timing of rate increases previously passed to existing tenants.\n\n\nImportantly, we continue to refine our ongoing revenue rate management program which includes regular internet data scraping of local competitors\u2019 prices. We do this in seeking to maintain our competitive market price advantage for our various sized storage units at our stores. This program helps us in seeking to maximize each store\u2019s\n \n\n\n48\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\noccupancies and our self storage revenue and NOI. We believe that, through our various marketing initiatives, we can continue to attract high quality, long term tenants who we expect will be storing with us for years. As of December 31, 2021, our average tenant duration of stay was approximately 3.0 years, up from approximately 2.7 years as of December 31, 2020.\n\n\nAnalysis of Combined Same-Store and Non Same-Store Cost of Operations\n\n\nCombined same-store and non same-store cost of operations increased 6.4% or $57,125 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 versus the three months ended December 31, 2020, and increased 5.3% or $190,177 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 versus the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. The year over year increase in combined same-store and non same-store cost of operations was due primarily to increased store level expenses relating to, amongst other categories, real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, landscaping, credit card fees, and utilities.\n \n\n\nEmployment.\n  On-site store manager payroll expense decreased 6.1% or $17,505 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 versus the three months ended December 31, 2020, and increased 0.7% or $7,953 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2021, was due primarily to wage increases, which was offset by routine employee departures. We currently expect inflationary increases in compensation rates for existing employees and other increases in compensation costs as we potentially add new stores as well as district and regional managers.\n\n\nReal Estate Property Tax.\n  Store property tax expense increased 8.0% or $25,652 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 versus the three months ended December 31, 2020, and increased 3.3% or $41,646 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. The increase in property tax expense during the year ended 2021 versus 2020 is primarily due to increased property assessment valuations and the loss of our Class 8 tax incentive granted to SSG Dolton LLC. See the section titled \u201cProperty Tax Expenses at Dolton, IL\u201d for additional detail. We currently expect store property tax expenses to increase during 2022, primarily due to the phaseout of the Class 8 tax incentive granted to SSG Dolton LLC and higher assessed property values.\n\n\nAdministrative.\n  We classify administrative expenses as bank charges related to processing the stores\u2019 cash receipts, credit card fees, repairs and maintenance, utilities, landscaping, alarm monitoring and trash removal. Administrative expenses increased 15.1% or $24,746 in the three months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020, and increased 20.6% or $131,051 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. We experienced an increase in administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 due primarily to increased repairs and maintenance, utilities, credit card fees, and landscaping expense. Credit card fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2021 due to a higher proportion of rental payments being received through credit cards, which is one of the results of our initiatives in building a higher quality overall tenant base. We currently expect moderate increases in other direct store costs in 2022.\n\n\nRepairs and maintenance expense increased 42.9% or $14,980 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 versus the three months ended December 31, 2020, and increased 20.4% or $24,307 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. Contributing to the increase in repair and maintenance expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, is certain one-time repairs completed during the year ended 2021.\n \n\n\nOur utility expenses are currently comprised of electricity, oil, and gas costs, which vary by store and are dependent upon energy prices and usage levels. Changes in usage levels are driven primarily by weather and temperature. Also, affecting our utilities expenses over time is our ongoing LED light replacement program at all of our stores which has already resulted in lower electricity usage. Utility expense increased 15.2% or $7,363 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 versus the three months ended December 31, 2020, and increased 6.8% or $15,166 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. \nThe increase in utility expense in the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 versus the same period in 2020 is \nprimarily due \nto rising costs for energy and higher energy usage at most of our stores during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021 versus the same periods in 2020\n. It is difficult to estimate future utility costs because weather, temperature, and energy prices are volatile and unpredictable. However, based upon current trends and expectations regarding commercial electricity rates, we currently expect inflationary increases in rates combined with lower usage resulting in higher net utility costs in 2022.\n\n\n49\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLandscaping expenses, which include snow removal costs, decreased 29.9% or $9,539 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 versus the three months ended December 31, 2020, and increased 52.2% or $56,458 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. \nThe increase in landscaping expense in the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 versus the same period in 2020 is \nprimarily due to \nhigher snow removal expenses in 2021\n. Landscaping expense levels are dependent upon many factors such as weather conditions, which can impact landscaping needs including, among other things, snow removal, inflation in material and labor costs, and random events. We currently expect inflationary increases in landscaping expense in 2022, excluding snow removal expense, which is primarily weather dependent and unpredictable.\n\n\nMarketing.  \nMarketing expense is comprised principally of internet advertising and the operating costs of our 24/7 kiosk and telephone call and reservation center. Marketing expense varies based upon demand, occupancy levels, and other factors. Internet advertising, in particular, can increase or decrease significantly in the short term in response to these factors. Marketing expense decreased 1.6% or $1,188 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 versus the three months ended December 31, 2020, and decreased 14.2% or $42,364 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. \nThe decrease in marketing expense in the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 versus the same period in 2020 is \nprimarily due to \ndecreased marketing costs and internet advertising expenses \nduring the year ended 2021. Based upon current trends in move-ins, move-outs, and occupancies, we currently expect marketing expense to increase in 2022.\n\n\nGeneral. \n Other direct store costs include general expenses incurred at the stores. General expenses include items such as store insurance, business license costs, and the cost of operating each store\u2019s rental office including supplies and telephone and data communication lines. General expenses increased 64.9% or $26,232 in the three months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020, and increased 14.6% or $36,570 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to increased expenses for travel and IT maintenance and support.\n \n\n\nProperty Tax Expenses at Dolton, IL\n\n\nLate in the third quarter of 2017, our Dolton, IL property was reassessed by the municipality and separately, our Class 8 tax incentive renewal hearing was held. As a result of those two events, our Dolton, IL property was reassessed at approximately 52% higher and the Class 8 tax incentive was not renewed. These events were applied retroactively to take effect on January 1, 2017. The combined impact was an increase in property tax expenses from $105,000 during 2016 to $210,000 during 2017, $240,000 during 2018, $395,000 during 2019, $399,000 during 2020, and $417,000 during 2021. The Class 8 tax incentive phases out over the years 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021. We currently expect the property tax expenses at our Dolton, IL property to increase by approximately 20% in 2022. Both the property tax reassessment and our Class 8 tax incentive renewal status are currently under appeal. However, there is no guarantee that either the assessment will be reduced or our Class 8 tax incentive status will be reinstated.\n\n\nAnalysis of Global Self Storage FFO and AFFO\t\n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe following tables present a reconciliation and computation of net income to funds from operations (\u201cFFO\u201d) and adjusted funds from operations (\u201cAFFO\u201d) and earnings per share to FFO and AFFO per share (unaudited):\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThree Months\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThree Months\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTwelve Months\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTwelve Months\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEnded\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEnded\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEnded\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEnded\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDecember 31, 2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDecember 31, 2020\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDecember 31, 2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDecember 31, 2020\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,379,643\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n315,785\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,281,251\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n274,341\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEliminate items excluded from FFO:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnrealized gain on marketable equity securities\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(775,542\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(127,737\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(1,566,731\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(155,139\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepreciation and amortization\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n409,669\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n461,859\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,631,609\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,989,761\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFFO attributable to common stockholders\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,013,770\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n649,907\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3,346,129\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2,108,963\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjustments:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompensation expense related to stock-based awards\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n54,098\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n26,273\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n194,372\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n126,035\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness development, capital raising, and property acquisition costs\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n34,896\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n470\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n45,531\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n10,998\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAFFO attributable to common stockholders\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,102,764\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n676,650\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,586,032\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,245,996\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarnings per share attributable to common stockholders -

During 2020, we completed three expansion / conversion projects at our properties located in Millbrook, NY, McCordsville, IN, and West Henrietta, NY.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn 2019, the Company broke ground on the Millbrook, NY expansion, which added approximately 11,800 leasable square feet of all-climate-controlled units. Upon completion in February 2020, the Millbrook, NY store's area occupancy dropped from approximately 88.6% to approximately 45.5%. Lease-up of the Millbrook, NY expansion has gone faster than expected. As of December 31, 2021, the Millbrook, NY store\u2019s total area occupancy stood at 96.3%.\n \n\n\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the Company began reviewing plans to convert certain commercially-leased space to all-climate-controlled units at the McCordsville, IN property. In April 2020, the Company commenced such conversion, which resulted in a new total of 535 units and 76,360 leasable square feet at the McCordsville, IN property. Upon completion in June 2020, the McCordsville, IN store's total area occupancy dropped from what would have been approximately 97.4% to approximately 79.1%. As of December 31, 2021, the McCordsville, IN store\u2019s total area occupancy stood at 89.3%. There is no guarantee that we will experience demand for the McCordsville, IN conversion or that we will be able to successfully lease-up the conversion to the occupancy level of our other properties.\n\n\n51\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur West Henrietta, NY store expansion project, completed in August 2020, added approximately 7,300 leasable square feet of drive-up storage units. Upon completion of the expansion project, West Henrietta, NY\u2019s total area occupancy dropped from approximately 89.6% to approximately 77.9%. As of December 31, 2021, the West Henrietta, NY store\u2019s total area occupancy stood at 84.4%. There is no guarantee that we will experience demand for the West Henrietta, NY expansion or that we will be able to successfully lease-up the expansion to the occupancy level of our other properties.\n\n\nIn 2021, the Company began reviewing plans to convert certain commercially-leased space to 3,000 leasable square feet of all-climate-controlled units at the Lima, OH property. In July 2021, the Company completed such conversion, resulting in a new total of 756 units and 96,883 leasable square feet at the Lima, OH property. Upon completion, total area occupancy was approximately 94.8%. As of \nDecember 31, 2021\n, the Lima, OH store\u2019s total area occupancy was approximately 95.7%. This conversion did not constitute a significant renovation or expansion because it only added approximately 3,000 leasable square feet of self storage to the property. As such, our Lima, OH property remained a same store property.\n\n\nAnalysis of Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses)\n\n\nUnrealized gains on the Company\u2019s investment in marketable equity securities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were $1,566,731 and $155,139, respectively. In accordance with the adoption of ASU 2016-01, as of January 1, 2018, the Company recognizes changes in the fair value of its investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values in net income. Previously, changes in fair value of the Company\u2019s investments in equity securities were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. As we continue to acquire and/or develop additional stores, as part of the funding for such activities, we plan to liquidate our investment in marketable equity securities and potentially realize gains or losses. As of December 31, 2021, our cumulative unrealized gain on marketable equity securities was $2,727,695. There were no realized gains or losses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\n \n\n", "item7a": ">Item 7A.
