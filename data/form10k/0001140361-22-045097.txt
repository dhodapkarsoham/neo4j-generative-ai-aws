See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for financial information concerning each business segment.\n4\nTable of Contents\nInternational Operations\nSee Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for financial information regarding the Company\u2019s domestic and international operations. See Note 1, subheading \u201cForeign Operations and Related Derivative Financial Instruments,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, along with the information under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d below, for information regarding risks related to the Company\u2019s foreign operations.\nResearch and Development\nThe Company commits significant resources to new product research and development in each of its business segments.\u00a0 Fishing conducts its product research, design, engineering and software development activities at its locations in Mankato and Little Falls, Minnesota; Alpharetta, Georgia; Toronto, Canada; and Eufaula, Alabama.\u00a0 Diving maintains research and development facilities in Zurich, Switzerland and Casarza Ligure, Italy.\u00a0 Research and development activities for Watercraft Recreation are performed in Old Town, Maine and Racine, Wisconsin.\u00a0 Product research, design and innovation for Camping products are conducted at the Company's Binghamton, New York, Racine, Wisconsin, Manchester, New Hampshire, and Old Town, Maine locations.\nThe Company expenses research and development costs as incurred, except for software development for new electronics products and bathymetry data collection and processing.\u00a0 These software development and bathymetry data collection and processing costs are capitalized once technological feasibility is established and then amortized over the expected useful life of the software or database. The amounts expensed by the Company in connection with research and development activities for each of the last three fiscal years are set forth in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Operations included elsewhere in this report.\nIndustry and Competitive Environment\nThe Company believes its products compete favorably on the basis of product innovation, product performance and marketing support and, to a lesser extent, price.\nFishing:\n\u00a0 Minn Kota\u2019s primary competitors in the electric trolling motors business are Motor Guide\u00ae and Lowrance\n\u2122\n, owned by Brunswick Corporation, and Garmin\n\u2122\n.

Competition in both businesses is focused on technological innovation, product quality and durability as well as product features and benefits for fishing.\nHumminbird\u2019s main competitors in the market for on-boat electronics are Garmin\n\u2122\n, Lowrance\n\u2122\n, and Raymarine\u00ae.\u00a0 Competition in this business is primarily focused on the quality of sonar imaging and display, easy to use graphical interfaces as well as the integration of mapping and GPS technology.\u00a0 Humminbird's competitors in marine cartography include Navionics\u00ae, owned by Garmin, and C-Map\u00ae, owned by Brunswick Corporation.\u00a0 Competition in this business focuses primarily on quality of data and quantity of available charts for inland lakes and ocean shoreline.\nCannon\u2019s main competitors in the downrigger market are Big Jon Sports\u00ae, Walker and Scotty\u00ae. Competition in this business primarily focuses on ease of operation, speed and durability.\nCamping:\n\u00a0 The Company\u2019s Camping brands and products compete in the sporting goods and specialty segments of the Camping market. Competitive brands with a strong position in the sporting goods channel include Coleman\u00ae and private label brands. The Company also competes with specialty companies such as Kelty\u00ae, The North Face\u00ae, Marmot\u00ae and Big Agnes\u00ae on the basis of materials and innovative designs for consumers who want performance products priced at a value.\nThe Company\u2019s portable outdoor cooking systems compete in the specialty and higher end performance backpacking and camping markets.\u00a0 The primary competitor in portable outdoor cooking systems is MSR\u00ae.\u00a0 Competition in this market is based on product size and weight, ease of use, reliability and performance.\nThe Company\u2019s competitors in the commercial tent market include Anchor Industries\u00ae and Aztec Tents for tension, frame and canopy tents.\u00a0 Competition in the commercial tent business is based on price, quality, structure, styling, ease of installation and technical support.\nThe Company sells military tents via third party distributors who hold supply contracts primarily with the U.S. Government, as well as to international governments.\u00a0 Such supply contracts can be for commercial off-the-shelf products in addition to products required to be built to unique specifications.\u00a0 Competitors in the military tent business include HDT\u00ae, Alaska Structures\u00ae, Camel, Outdoor Venture, and Diamond Brand.\n5\nTable of Contents\nWatercraft Recreation:\n\u00a0 The Company primarily competes in this segment in the kayak and canoe product categories of the paddlesports market. The Company\u2019s main competitors in this market are Hobie Cat\u00ae, Pelican International Inc., Wenonah Canoe, Jackson Kayak and Legacy Paddlesports\u2122, each of which competes on the basis of their product\u2019s design, performance, quality and price.\nDiving:\n\u00a0 The main competitors in the Diving segment include Aqua Lung\u00ae, Suunto\u00ae, Atomic Aquatics, Oceanic, Cressi and Mares\u00ae.\u00a0 Competitive advantage in the life support product category of this segment, which consists of regulators, dive computers, and buoyancy compensators, is a function of product innovation, performance, quality and safety. Competition in the general diving product category of fins, masks, snorkels and wetsuits is characterized by low barriers to entry and numerous competitors who compete on the basis of product innovation, performance, quality and price.\nBacklog\nUnfilled orders for future delivery of products varies as a result of numerous factors impacting the Company (including those described in the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d below) and because of the non-binding nature of such orders, the Company does not believe that backlog information is material to the understanding of its business.\nEmployees and Human Capital Resources\nAt September\u00a030, 2022, the Company had approximately 1,500 regular, full-time employees, of which approximately 1,200 were employed in the United States and approximately 300 were employed outside of the United States. \u00a0Approximately 55 or 4% were represented by a collective bargaining agreement, all of whom are located at our facilities in Batam, Indonesia.  In recent years, we have not experienced any significant work slowdowns, stoppages, or other labor disruptions.  The Company considers its employee relations to be excellent. Temporary employees are utilized primarily to manage peaks in the seasonal manufacturing of products.\nThe Company remains committed to areas of work place safety, product quality and customer satisfaction. Successful execution of our mission is dependent on attracting, developing and retaining key employees and members of our management team, as well as providing competitive pay and benefits.\nPatents, Trademarks and Proprietary Rights\nThe Company holds patents for various of\u00a0the products it sells and regularly files applications for patents.\u00a0 The Company has numerous trademarks and trade names which it considers important to its business, many of which are noted in this report. Historically, the Company has vigorously defended its intellectual property rights and expects to continue to do so.\nSupply Chain and Sourcing of Materials\nThe Company manufactures some products that use parts or materials that, due to geographical distance, limited supplier capacity or availability or competing demands for such parts or materials, are only available in a cost effective manner from a single vendor or require the Company to place orders several months in advance of required delivery.\nHistorically, the Company attempted to mitigate product availability and these supply chain risks when possible through the purchase of safety stock, use of forecast-based supply contracts, and, to a lesser extent, with just in time inventory deliveries or supplier-owned inventory located close to the Company\u2019s manufacturing locations.\u00a0 In doing so, the Company strived to balance the businesses\u2019 need to maintain adequate inventory levels with the cost of holding such inventory by manufacturing to forecast for high volume products, utilizing build-to-order strategies wherever possible, and by having contract-manufactured products delivered to customers directly from the supplier.\u00a0 The Company also seeks to manage its inventory through on-going product design and logistical initiatives with its suppliers to reduce lead times.\nSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been significant widely-documented supply chain and logistics disruptions across industries, including those in which the Company operates.  While the Company expects that these supply chain disruptions will continue into fiscal 2023, the Company remains focused on evaluating and pursuing additional options (beyond building inventory) to manage its supply chain and meet consumer demand for its products.  Supply chain disruptions are dynamic and may impact the cost of goods sold for future sales of product or the Company\u2019s ability to fill demand for its products, especially given the volatility and changing circumstances brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic environment. \nSeasonality\n6\nTable of Contents\nThe Company\u2019s products in each of its business segments are primarily warm-weather, outdoor recreation-related, which has historically resulted in seasonal variations in sales and profitability for the Company. This seasonal variability was traditionally due to customers\u2019 increasing their inventories in the quarters ending March and June, which is the typical primary selling season for the Company\u2019s outdoor recreation products, with lower inventory volumes during the quarters ending September and December. \nDue to the timing of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Company\u2019s primary-selling season during fiscal 2020 was interrupted resulting in a significant shift in sales volumes during the 2020 fiscal year toward the last fiscal quarter of that year versus the typical primary selling season which usually occurs during the second and third fiscal quarters, as noted above.  During fiscal years 2021 and 2022, as described above under \"Supply Chain and Sourcing of Materials,\" the Company was impacted by supply chain disruptions that impacted sales and operating profit towards the latter half of fiscal 2022.  Accordingly, because of the ongoing supply chain disruption and the current macroeconomic conditions (including related to rising prices and inflationary conditions), the Company cannot predict at this time whether it will experience typical seasonality in demand for its products during fiscal 2023 and beyond.\nTypically and prior to the impact of COVID-19 as noted above, the Company had mitigated the seasonality of its businesses somewhat by encouraging customers to purchase and take delivery of products more evenly through the year.\u00a0 The following table shows, for the past three fiscal years, the total consolidated net sales and operating profit or loss of the Company for each quarter, as a percentage of the total year.  See \u201cCoronavirus (COVID-19)\u201d in Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information of the impact of COVID-19 on the Company\u2019s seasonality for fiscal 2021 and 2022.\n\u00a0\nFiscal Year\n\u00a0\n2022\n2021\n2020\nQuarter Ended\nNet\nSales\nOperating\nProfit\nNet\nSales\nOperating\nProfit\u00a0\nNet\n\u00a0 Sales\nOperating\nProfit\nDecember\n21\u00a0\n%\n21\u00a0\n%\n22\u00a0\n%\n22\u00a0\n%\n22\u00a0\n%\n10\u00a0\n%\nMarch\n26\u00a0\n%\n23\u00a0\n%\n27\u00a0\n%\n32\u00a0\n%\n27\u00a0\n%\n45\u00a0\n%\nJune\n27\u00a0\n%\n36\u00a0\n%\n29\u00a0\n%\n34\u00a0\n%\n23\u00a0\n%\n17\u00a0\n%\nSeptember\n26\u00a0\n%\n20\u00a0\n%\n22\u00a0\n%\n12\u00a0\n%\n28\u00a0\n%\n28\u00a0\n%\n\u00a0\n100\u00a0\n%\n100\u00a0\n%\n100\u00a0\n%\n100\u00a0\n%\n100\u00a0\n%\n100\u00a0\n%\n\u00a0\nEnvironment and Climate Change\nThe Company is subject to various supranational, federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances, regulations, and other requirements of governmental authorities.\u00a0 We believe we comply with such laws and regulations.\u00a0 Expenditures on environmental compliance have not had, and we believe in the future, are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.\u00a0 We do not believe that any direct or indirect consequences of legislation related to climate change will have a material adverse effect on our operating costs, facilities or products.  However, risk of environmental liability and charges associated with maintaining compliance with environmental laws is inherent in the nature of the Company\u2019s business and there is no assurance that material liabilities or charges could not arise.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company maintains a website at www.johnsonoutdoors.com.

Additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our future business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such cases, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nOperational Risk Factors\nOur net sales and profitability depend on our ability to continue to conceive, design and market products that appeal to our consumers.\nOur business depends on our ability to continue to conceive, design, manufacture and market new products and upon continued market acceptance of our product offering. As described elsewhere in this Report, product research and development is an important component of our success and our market strategy.  Rapidly changing consumer preferences and trends make it difficult to predict how long consumer demand for our existing products will continue or what new products will be successful. A decline in consumer demand for our products, our failure to develop new products on a timely basis in anticipation of changing consumer preferences or the failure of our new products to achieve and sustain consumer acceptance could reduce our net sales and profitability.\nIntellectual property disputes relating to our products could increase our costs.\nOur industry is susceptible to litigation regarding patent infringement and infringement of other intellectual property rights. We could be either a plaintiff or a defendant in trademark, patent and/or other intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims and claims of breach of license from time to time. The prosecution or defense of any intellectual property litigation is both costly and disruptive of the time and resources of our management and product development teams, even if the claim or defense against us is without merit. The scope of any patent or other intellectual property to which we have or may obtain rights also may not prevent others from developing and selling competing products.\u00a0 The validity and breadth of claims covered in patents and other intellectual property involve complex legal and factual questions, and the resolution of such claims may be highly uncertain, lengthy and expensive.\u00a0 In addition, our patents or other intellectual property may be held invalid upon challenge, or others may claim that we have improperly or invalidly sought patent or other intellectual property protection for our technology, thus exposing us to direct or counter claims in any patent or intellectual property proceeding. We could also be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs to resolve intellectual property litigation.  Furthermore, we may rely on trade secret law to protect technologies and proprietary information that we cannot or have chosen not to patent. Trade secrets, however, are difficult to protect. Although we attempt to maintain protection through confidentiality agreements with necessary personnel, contractors and consultants, we cannot guarantee that such contracts will not be breached. In the event of a breach of a confidentiality agreement or the divulgence of proprietary information, we may not have adequate legal remedies to maintain our trade secret protection. Litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights, even if ultimately successful, could be costly and could divert management\u2019s attention away from the Company\u2019s business.\u00a0 Any of these negative events could adversely affect our profitability or operating results.\nProduct recalls and other claims could affect our financial position and results of operations.\nAs a manufacturer and distributor of consumer products, we could be required to repurchase or recall one or more of our products if they are found to not meet quality or safety standards or be defective.\u00a0 A repurchase or recall of our products could be costly to us and could damage the reputation of our brands.\u00a0 If we were required to remove, or voluntarily remove our products from the market, our reputation could be tarnished and we might have large quantities of finished products that we could not sell.\u00a0 As a result, product recalls could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may experience difficulties in integrating strategic acquisitions.\nWe have, as part of our strategy, historically pursued strategic acquisitions.\u00a0 The pursuit of future growth through acquisitions involves significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\u00a0 Risks associated with integrating strategic acquisitions include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs relating to the integration of acquired businesses may increase our expenses and reduce our profitability;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving planned cost savings and synergies may increase our expenses;\n8\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nunanticipated management or operational problems or liabilities may adversely affect our profitability and financial condition; and/or\n\u2022\nbreaches of the representations or warranties or other violations of the contractual obligations required by the acquisition agreement of other parties to the acquisition transaction and any contractual remedies related thereto may not adequately protect or compensate us.\nWe are dependent upon certain key members of management.\nOur success will depend to a significant degree on the abilities and efforts of our senior management. Moreover, our success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified management, marketing, technical and sales personnel. These people are in high demand and often have competing employment opportunities. The labor market for skilled employees is highly competitive and we may lose key employees or be forced to increase their compensation to retain these people. Employee turnover could significantly increase our recruitment, training and other related employee costs. The loss of key personnel, or the failure to attract qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely on our credit facilities to provide us with sufficient working capital to operate our business.\nBecause of the historic seasonal nature of our business, we have from time to time relied upon our credit facilities to provide us with adequate working capital to operate our business.\u00a0 To the extent we again become more dependent upon our credit facilities to fund our operations, if our lenders reduce or terminate our access to amounts under our credit facilities, we may not have sufficient capital to fund our working capital needs and/or we may need to secure additional capital or financing to fund our working capital requirements or to repay outstanding debt under our credit facilities.\u00a0 We can make no assurance that we will be successful in ensuring our availability of amounts under our credit facilities when they are needed or in connection with raising additional capital and that any amount, if raised, will be sufficient to meet our cash flow requirements.\u00a0 In the event we do not have available cash balances on hand for funding future operations, and if we are not able to maintain our borrowing availability under our credit facilities at that time and/or raise additional capital when needed, we may be forced to sharply curtail our efforts to manufacture and promote the sale of our products or to curtail our operations.\u00a0 \nOur debt covenants may limit our ability to complete acquisitions, incur debt, make investments, sell assets, merge or complete other significant transactions.\n\u00a0\nOur credit facilities and certain other of our debt instruments include limitations on a number of our activities in the event of a default, and in some cases regardless of whether a default has occurred, including our ability to:\n\u00a0\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on our assets or make guarantees;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments or loans; or\n\u2022\ndispose of or sell assets, make acquisitions above certain amounts or enter into a merger or similar transaction.\nAlthough in recent periods we have not had to borrow funds under our credit facilities, we still are required to comply with certain restrictive covenants in our credit facilities, any of which may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best long term interests.\u00a0 Additionally, a breach of any of the restrictive covenants in our credit facilities could result in a default under these facilities.\u00a0 If a default occurs while we have borrowing amounts outstanding, the lenders under our credit facilities may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable, to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings and to exercise any other rights they have under the facilities or applicable law.\nWe may be subject to disruptions or failures in our information technology systems and network infrastructures that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and network infrastructures to operate our business. We also hold data in various company-owned and third party data center facilities upon which our business depends. A disruption, infiltration, breach or failure of these information technology systems or any of these data centers as a result of software or hardware malfunctions, system implementations or upgrades, computer viruses, third-party security breaches, employee error, theft or misuse, malfeasance, power disruptions, natural disasters or accidents could cause breaches of data security, loss of intellectual property and critical data and the release and misappropriation of sensitive competitive information. Any of these events could result in the loss of key information, impair our production and supply chain processes, harm our competitive position, damage our reputation with customers, cause us to incur significant costs to remedy any damages and ultimately materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n9\nTable of Contents\nWhile we have implemented a number of protective measures, such measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent or fully address the adverse effect of such events.\nRegulatory Risk Factors\nUncertainty over global tariffs, or the financial impact of tariffs, may negatively affect our results.\nChanges in U.S. domestic and global tariff frameworks over the last three years have increased our costs of producing goods and resulted in additional risks to our supply chain. More tariff changes are also possible. We have developed strategies to mitigate, in part, previously implemented and, in some cases, proposed tariff increases, but there is no assurance we will be able to continue to mitigate the impact of tariff increases in substantial part on our financial and operating results. Further, uncertainties about future tariff changes could result in mitigation actions undertaken by us that could prove to be detrimental to our business and our relationships with our customers and suppliers.  The scope of the tariffs and the rates at which they are implemented may continue to fluctuate and change in an unpredictable manner that further complicates our ability to implement mitigation actions. \nThe effective tax rate of the Company may be negatively impacted by future changes to tax laws in global jurisdictions in which we operate.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings could have a material impact on our effective tax rate. Many countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws. Certain proposals could include recommendations that could increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business. Any changes in the taxation of our activities in such jurisdictions may result in a material increase in our effective tax rate. \nWe are subject to environmental, climate change, safety and human rights regulations and legislation.\nWe are subject to supranational, federal, state, local and foreign laws and other legal requirements related to the generation, storage, transport, treatment and disposal of materials as a result of our manufacturing and assembly operations. These laws include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (as amended), the Clean Air Act (as amended) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (as amended), as well as similar laws in foreign jurisdictions.\u00a0 Risk of environmental liability and changes associated with maintaining compliance with environmental laws is inherent in the nature of our business and there is no assurance that material liabilities or changes would not arise.\nWe are also subject to various supranational, federal, state and local environmental, laws, ordinances, regulations and other legislation or requirements of governmental authorities as it relates to climate change.\n \nWe believe we comply with such laws and regulations. \n \nWe do not believe that any direct or indirect consequences of legislation related to climate change will have a material adverse effect on our operating costs, facilities, or products.\n \nHowever, evolving regulatory and legislative measures related to protecting against climate change could ultimately pose a risk to our business by influencing the buying patterns of our customers or increasing internal compliance costs.\n \nThe Company is also subject to the requirement of Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and SEC rules related thereto to conduct due diligence and disclose and report on whether certain minerals and metals, known as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d are contained in the Company\u2019s products and whether they originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo (\u201cDRC\u201d) and adjoining countries. We may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we implement.\nOur failure to adequately protect personal information could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA wide variety of local, state, national, and international laws, directives and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer, and other processing of personal data (including with respect to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and U.S. state laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act). These data protection and privacy-related laws and regulations continue to evolve and may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions and increased costs of compliance. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or to protect such data, could result in enforcement actions against us, including fines, imprisonment of company officials and public censure, claims for damages by end-customers and other affected individuals, damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill (both in relation to existing end-customers and prospective end-customers), any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance, and business. Changing definitions of personal data and personal information, within the European Union, the United States, and elsewhere may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or \n10\nTable of Contents\nexpand our business, including limiting strategic partnerships that may involve the sharing of data. The evolving data protection regulatory environment may require significant management attention and financial resources to analyze and modify our information technology infrastructure to meet these changing requirements all of which could reduce our operating margins and impact our operating results and financial condition.\nMarket and Economic Risk Factors\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted worldwide economic conditions and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our operations and business.\nOur operations are exposed to risks associated with pandemics, epidemics or other public health emergencies, such as the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).  Outbreaks such as these have resulted, and can continue to result, in governments around the world implementing stringent or restrictive measures to help control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, \"shelter in place\" and \"stay at home\" orders, travel restrictions, business curtailments, school closures, and other measures.  Depending on the timing of these actions, and the scope of the economic activity they impact, we may experience negative impacts on our operations, supply chain, transportation networks, customers and employees and any of such events can impact or adjust the historic seasonality or buying patterns for our products.  Further, any health pandemic (or any worsening thereof), including COVID-19 or a similar pandemic, may result in public health measures that may cause an economic downturn that adversely affects demand for our products, and negatively impacts our business or results of operations through the temporary closure of our operating locations or those of our customers or suppliers.  The pandemic (or the continuing worsening of it) may also impact the buying patterns and demand for our products (either positively or negatively) by our customers including by generally limiting or discouraging various leisure and travel activities that may adversely impact consumer use of certain of our products.\nAs we have previously disclosed in our public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, during the latter half of fiscal 2020 and throughout fiscal 2021, we saw favorable impact of COVID-19 on our results due to increased participation in fishing, camping and watercraft recreation and related demand for our products, largely driven by consumer desire to engage in socially distant and safe activities in the great outdoors.  It is not certain any previously experienced favorable impacts will continue or will recur in the future, especially as demand for outdoor recreation products moderate.  Additionally, even where demand may be strong, we face the potential for supply chain constraints and disruptions (including as it relates to the timing, sourcing, availability and cost of raw materials and components) given the overall increased stress on global supply chains and the need to operate with appropriate safety measures in operating environments.  The extent to which COVID-19 or another similar pandemic may continue to adversely or favorably impact our business depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, including new information concerning the severity of the outbreak, the effectiveness of actions globally to contain or mitigate its effects, including government actions to stimulate the economy and prevent further downturns, and the impact of these events on the timing, sourcing, availability and cost of raw materials and components for production of our products.  The current level of uncertainty over the economic and operational impacts of any pandemic (including COVID-19 or similar health pandemic) and the impact of such a pandemic on our supply chain requirements means the related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.  \nCompetition, consolidation and financial distress in our markets could reduce our net sales, profitability and cash flows.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets. We compete with several large domestic and foreign companies such as Brunswick,  Garmin, and Aqua Lung, with private label products sold by many of our retail customers and with other producers of outdoor recreation products. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, stronger brand recognition and greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than us. In addition, due to limited barriers to entry in some of the product industries we engage in, we may face competition from new participants in our markets or from existing participants developing and introducing new products into our market segments. Further, we experience price competition for our products, and competition for shelf space at retailers, all of which may increase in the future. Consolidation of our retail markets could result in fewer but larger retail customers, which may further result in lower selling prices or reduced sales volumes of our products or greater competition for shelf space in these retail markets.  Further, financial distress or bankruptcies in our retail markets could negatively impact our operating results and cash flows.\u00a0 If we cannot compete in our product markets successfully in the future, our net sales, profitability and cash flows will likely decline.\nGeneral economic conditions affect the Company\u2019s results.\nOur revenues are affected by economic conditions and consumer confidence worldwide, but especially in the United States and Europe.\u00a0 In times of economic uncertainty, consumers tend to defer expenditures for discretionary items, which affects demand for our products.\u00a0 Moreover, our businesses are cyclical and seasonal in nature, and their success is impacted by general economic conditions and specific economic conditions affecting the regions and markets we serve, the overall level of \n11\nTable of Contents\nconsumer confidence in the economy and discretionary income levels.\u00a0 Any substantial deterioration in general economic conditions that diminishes consumer confidence or discretionary income can reduce our sales and adversely affect our financial results.\u00a0 Moreover, declining economic conditions create the potential for future impairments of goodwill and other intangible and long-lived assets that may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\u00a0 Various uncertainties tied to economic conditions, including significant adverse changes in business climate, adverse actions by regulators, unanticipated competition, loss of key customers, a downturn in the economy or in discretionary income levels or changes in consumer preferences could impact the expected cash flows to be generated by an asset or group of assets, and may result in an impairment of those assets.  The impact of weak consumer credit markets, corporate restructurings, layoffs, prolonged high unemployment rates, declines in the value of investments and residential real estate, higher fuel prices and increases in federal and state taxation all can negatively affect our operating results.\nAs noted above, because a substantial majority of our net revenue is generated through discretionary spending by consumers for our outdoor recreation products, a downturn in the economy resulting from prolonged supply chain disruptions or labor shortages, a significant increase in inflation rates (including in connection with rising interest rates through government action to fight inflationary trends), or a reduction in consumer confidence in the U.S. economy may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as consumers generally reduce their discretionary spending during such periods.  Inflation rates have increased and may continue to rise or stay elevated for some time, all of which negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending patterns. Additionally, inflationary trends and uncertainties in the economic climate in the United States and elsewhere could have a similar negative impact on the rate and amounts of purchases by our current and potential customers, create price inflation for our products, or otherwise have a negative impact on our expenses, gross margins and revenues, all of which could hinder our growth.\nA limited number of our shareholders can exert significant influence over the Company.\nAs of September\u00a030, 2022, Helen P. Johnson-Leipold, members of her family and related entities (hereinafter the Johnson Family), held approximately 75% of the voting power of both classes of our common stock taken as a whole. This voting power would permit these shareholders, if they chose to act together, to exert significant influence over the outcome of shareholder votes, including votes concerning the election of directors, by-law amendments, possible mergers, corporate control contests and other significant corporate transactions.\u00a0 Moreover, certain members of the Johnson Family have entered into a voting trust agreement covering approximately 99% of our outstanding class B common shares.\u00a0 This voting trust agreement permits these shareholders, if they continue to choose to act together, to exert significant influence over the outcome of shareholder votes, including votes concerning the election of directors, by-law amendments, possible mergers, corporate control contests and other significant corporate transactions.\nOur shares of common stock are thinly traded and our stock price may be volatile.\nBecause our common stock is thinly traded, its market price may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market in general or the stock prices of similar companies, which are exchanged, listed or quoted on NASDAQ or another stock exchange. We believe there are approximately 5,301,000 shares of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates as of September\u00a030, 2022. Thus, our common stock will be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership, and as a result, the trading price for our shares of common stock may be more volatile. Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of our common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price for our stock than would be the case if our public float were larger.\nOur stock price is volatile and our shareholders may not be able to resell shares of Class A Common Stock at or above the price they paid.\nThe trading price of our Class A Common Stock is highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nannouncements relating to our earnings trends or with respect to any cost-cutting actions or other strategic transactions involving Johnson Outdoors;\n\u2022\nannouncements relating to, and disruptions in, the sourcing, timing, availability and cost of raw materials and components necessary for the production of our products;\n\u2022\nannouncements relating to product development efforts of Johnson Outdoors or competitors; \n\u2022\nannouncements relating to the receipt, modification or termination of customer or supplier contracts, including with respect to any government contracts or grants;\n\u2022\nprevailing economic conditions;\n\u2022\nbusiness disruptions caused by weather events, pandemics, or other natural disasters; \n\u2022\ndisputes concerning Johnson Outdoors' or its competitors' intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n12\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nsales of our Class A Common Stock by our executive officers and directors or our significant shareholders in the future;\n\u2022\nthe lack of an active, liquid, and orderly market in our Class A Common Stock;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our quarterly operating results; and\n\u2022\nthe issuance of new or changed securities analysts' reports or recommendations regarding the shares of our Class A Common Stock\nIn addition, the stock markets in general, and the markets for equity securities in companies principally operating in the outdoor leisure or recreational product markets, have experienced periods of high volatility that have been often unrelated to the operating performance of the issuer. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price or liquidity of our Class A Common Stock.\nSources of and fluctuations in market prices of raw materials can affect our operating results.\nThe primary raw materials we use in manufacturing our products are metals, resins, electronic components, and packaging materials. These materials are generally available from a number of suppliers, but traditionally we have chosen to concentrate our sourcing with a limited number of vendors for each commodity or purchased component. Under normal circumstances, we believe our sources of raw materials are reliable and adequate for our needs. However, many materials and components continue to be subject to shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations due to deterioration of the global supply chain.  The development of future sourcing issues related to the availability of these materials as well as significant fluctuations in the market prices of these materials may have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nOur profitability is also affected by significant fluctuations in the prices of the raw materials and components we use in our products, including the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on raw materials and purchased components.\u00a0 We may not be able to pass along any price increases in our raw materials or other component costs to our customers.\u00a0 As a result, an increase in the cost of raw materials, labor or other costs associated with the manufacturing of our products could increase our costs of sales and reduce our gross margins.\nFinancial distress in supply chain and shortage of raw materials or components of supply.\nDeteriorating industry conditions can adversely affect our supply base.\u00a0 Lower production levels at our major suppliers and volatility in certain raw material and energy costs may result in severe financial distress among many companies within our supply base, which may result in issues impacting the sourcing, timing, availability and cost of raw materials and components necessary to manufacture our products.\u00a0 Financial distress within our supply base and/or our suppliers\u2019 inability to obtain credit from lending institutions could lead to commercial disputes and possible supply chain interruptions to our business.\u00a0 In addition, potential adverse industry conditions may require us to provide financial assistance or other measures to ensure uninterrupted production of key components or materials used in the production of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our existing and future revenues and net income.  For example, our inventory levels have increased significantly in recent periods as we attempt to build inventory with the goal of mitigating and/or preparing for a continuing disruption of the supply chain, originally starting as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, but continuing as a result of global economic conditions, including due to rising interest rates, inflationary pressures and the conflict in the Ukraine.\nWe are currently experiencing supply shortages and cost increases for certain components and raw materials that are crucial to our manufacturing process.  Continued higher levels of consumer demand or growth in demand for our outdoor recreation products may exacerbate these pressures, and, therefore, depending upon the severity of, and any continuing adverse impact to, global economic conditions affecting the cost and availability of raw materials and components used in our products, these supply chain challenges described above may continue for the foreseeable future, and may continue to adversely impact our margins for some time.  As noted above, we have chosen to take action to increase our inventories and purchase commitments in an attempt to ensure we have adequate inventory levels to meet customer expectations and demand for our products.  Nonetheless not all necessary components to build inventory have been readily available at reasonable prices or at all.    \nAdditionally, in the event of catastrophic acts of nature such as fires, tsunamis, hurricanes and earthquakes or a rapid increase in production demands, either we, or our suppliers may experience supply shortages of raw materials or components.\u00a0 This could be caused by a number of factors, including a lack of production line capacity or manpower or working capital constraints.\u00a0 As our industry consolidates its supply base in order to manage the costs of purchased goods and services, there is greater dependence on fewer sources of supply for certain components and materials used in our products, which could increase the possibility of a supply shortage of any particular component.\u00a0 If we or one of our own suppliers experience a supply shortage, we may become unable to produce the affected products if we cannot procure the components from another source.\u00a0 Such production interruptions could impede a ramp-up in production and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n13\nTable of Contents\nWe consider the production capacities and financial condition of suppliers in our selection process, and expect that they will meet our delivery requirements.\u00a0 However, there can be no assurance that strong demand, capacity limitations, shortages of raw materials, labor disputes, freight capacity or other problems will not result in any shortages or delays in the supply of components to us.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results.\nWe have significant foreign operations, for which the functional currencies are denominated primarily in euros, Swiss francs, Hong Kong dollars and Canadian dollars. As the values of the currencies of the foreign countries in which we have operations increase or decrease relative to the U.S. dollar, the sales, expenses, profits, losses, assets and liabilities of our foreign operations, as reported in our consolidated financial statements, increase or decrease, accordingly. Approximately 13% of our revenues for the year ended September\u00a030, 2022 were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Approximately 4% were denominated in euros and approximately 6% were denominated in Canadian dollars with the remaining 3% denominated in various other foreign currencies. We may mitigate a portion of the impact of fluctuations in certain foreign currencies on our operations through the purchase of foreign currency swaps, forward contracts and options to hedge known commitments denominated in foreign currencies or to reduce the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on foreign currency borrowings.\nBecause we rely on foreign suppliers and we sell products in foreign markets, we are susceptible to numerous international business risks that could increase our costs or disrupt the supply of our products.\nOur international operations subject us to risks, including:\n\u00a0\n\u2022\neconomic and political instability;\n\u2022\nrestrictive actions by foreign governments, including with respect to tariffs or trade policies;\n\u2022\nopportunity costs and reputational damage related to the presence of counterfeit versions of the Company\u2019s products in such foreign markets;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nchanges in tariffs, import duties or import or export restrictions;\n\u2022\ntimely shipping of product and unloading of product, including the timely rail/truck delivery to our warehouses and/or a customer\u2019s warehouse of our products;\n\u2022\ncomplications in complying with the laws and policies of the United States affecting the importation of goods, including tariffs, duties, quotas and taxes;\n\u2022\nrequired compliance with U.S. laws that impact the Company\u2019s operations in foreign jurisdictions that do not impact local operating companies; and\n\u2022\ncomplications in complying with trade and foreign tax laws.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nCyber security vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions, services and data.\u00a0\nIncreased global cyber security vulnerabilities, threats, computer viruses and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks, as well as cyber security failures resulting from human error and technological errors, pose a risk to our systems, products and data as well as potentially to our employees\u2019, customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 data and systems that may ultimately impact us. We attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, monitoring and testing, and maintenance of protective systems and contingency plans, but we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats. There is no assurance the impact from such threats will not be material to our financial results or reputation and it could result in security breaches, theft, lost or corrupted data, misappropriation of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, loss of trade secrets and commercially valuable information, production downtimes and operational disruptions, any of which may adversely affect our profitability or operating results.\nFuture terror attacks, war, natural disasters or other catastrophic events beyond our control could negatively impact our business.\nTerror attacks, war or other civil disturbances, natural disasters and other catastrophic events could lead to economic instability and decreased demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\u00a0 In the past, terrorist attacks have caused instability in global financial markets and the industries in which we compete and have negatively affected spending on consumer discretionary products.\u00a0 In addition, our facilities are located throughout the world and could be subject to damage from terrorism incidents or from fires, floods, earthquakes or other natural \n14\nTable of Contents\nor man-made disasters.\u00a0 Terrorist incidents could also lead to increased border security which could in turn negatively impact our global supply chain by causing shipping delays or shortages in key materials or components, increasing the cost of such goods or requiring us to keep greater inventories, any of which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nOur business is susceptible to adverse weather conditions or events.\nOur success is in part affected by adverse weather conditions, including fires, floods, tornadoes, severe cold and other natural disasters. Such events have the tendency to create fluctuations in demand for our products which may increase our expenses and reduce our profitability.\u00a0 Moreover, our profitability is affected by our ability to successfully manage our inventory levels and demand for our products, which, in part depends upon the efficient operation of our production and delivery systems. These systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from the aforementioned natural disasters.\u00a0 Such natural disasters could adversely impact our ability to meet delivery requirements of our customers, which may result in our need to incur extra costs to expedite production and delivery of product to meet customer demand. Any of these events could negatively impact our profitability.", "item7": ">ITEM 7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nUnless otherwise stated, all monetary amounts in this Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, other than per share amounts, are stated in thousands.\nExecutive Overview\nThe Company designs, manufactures and markets high quality recreational products for the outdoor enthusiast. Through a combination of innovative products, strong marketing, a talented and passionate workforce and efficient distribution, the Company seeks to set itself apart from the competition in its markets. Its subsidiaries operate as a network that promotes innovation and leverages best practices and synergies, following the strategic vision set by executive management and approved by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors.\nCoronavirus (COVID-19)\u00a0\n17\nTable of Contents\nThe COVID-19 pandemic drove consumer desire to engage in socially distant and safe activities outdoors. As a result, increased participation in Fishing, Camping and Watercraft Recreation also increased demand for our products across Company segments beginning in fiscal 2020 and continuing throughout fiscal 2022.  As global travel restrictions also eased, we experienced increased participation and resulting increased product demand in the Diving segment beginning in fiscal 2021 and continuing through fiscal 2022. \nIn addition to this increase in demand for Company products, COVID-19 and the resulting macroeconomic dynamics have also caused widely-documented supply chain and logistics disruptions across industries.  Specifically, the adverse supply chain and logistics constraints and disruptions have impacted the timing, sourcing, availability and cost of raw materials and components that are necessary to manufacture our outdoor recreation products, especially in our Fishing segment due to the electronic components used in those products.  Because certain electronic components that are necessary for manufacturing our higher volume products in that segment have been most impacted by the supply chain and logistics disruptions, there has been limited availability of those materials and components, as well as increased pricing and inflationary pressures on such components when they have become available, all of which impacted our margins during fiscal 2022.  The Company has attempted to mitigate these disruptions by purchasing significantly higher levels of certain raw material and component inventory as they have been available, in many cases at higher price points than what was historically paid, to enable the Company to complete finished product orders as soon as the missing raw material and component inventory items become available.  Nonetheless, shortages throughout fiscal 2022 have impacted the Fishing segment's ability to complete products for shipping, which has ultimately resulted in decreased sales volumes in the Fishing segment over the prior year, despite continued demand for our Fishing products, as evidenced by outstanding orders. \nAdditionally, the Company's buying actions have subsequently resulted in decreased margins and the Company carrying significantly higher levels of inventory for a number of its materials, components and products at the end of fiscal 2022.  Though the Company continues to believe the inventory that it has built and which exists on its balance sheet is useable and salable in the ordinary course of business, it continues to monitor the current reserve balances for obsolete and excess inventory.  However, any changes in consumer demand for the Company's outdoor recreation products, changes in economic conditions, or changes in customer inventory levels or competitive conditions could have a favorable or unfavorable effect on required reserve balances in the future.      \nBecause the Company expects that supply chain disruptions, as well as inflationary pricing conditions for raw materials and components necessary to manufacture product, will continue into fiscal 2023, the Company remains focused on evaluating and pursuing additional options (beyond building inventory) to meet the demand for its products.  During fiscal 2023 the Company expects to closely monitor customer demand and proactively manage its higher than normal inventory levels.  Nonetheless, these supply chain and logistics disruptions and inflationary pricing conditions remain fluid and will likely adversely impact the cost of goods sold for future sales of product.\nHighlights\nThe Company's fiscal 2022 and 2021 each comprised 52 weeks, whereas the fiscal year ended October 2, 2020 comprised 53 weeks.  The Company\u2019s fiscal 2022 revenues decreased by 1% from the prior year.  While consumer and customer demand for the Company's products remained strong throughout fiscal 2022 as evidenced by outstanding order volumes, sales volumes were negatively impacted by product availability caused by the supply chain disruptions described above, particularly in Fishing, the Company's largest segment.  This sales volume decrease and lower gross margins resulting from higher costs of sales were the primary drivers of the $44,973 decrease in operating profit in fiscal 2022 over fiscal 2021.\n\u00a0\nResults of Operations\nSummary consolidated financial results from continuing operations for the fiscal years presented were as follows:\n\u00a0\n18\nTable of Contents\n(thousands, except per share data)\n2022\n2021\n2020\nNet sales\n$\n743,355\u00a0\n$\n751,651\u00a0\n$\n594,209\u00a0\nGross profit\n271,332\u00a0\n334,125\u00a0\n264,993\u00a0\nOperating expenses\n205,022\u00a0\n222,842\u00a0\n193,923\u00a0\nOperating profit\n66,310\u00a0\n111,283\u00a0\n71,070\u00a0\nInterest income, net\n(654)\n(221)\n(1,270)\nOther income, net\n8,076\u00a0\n(1,418)\n(1,362)\nIncome tax expense\n14,397\u00a0\n29,541\u00a0\n18,469\u00a0\nNet income\n44,491\u00a0\n83,381\u00a0\n55,233\u00a0\nThe Company\u2019s internal and external sales and operating profit (loss) by business segment for each of the three most recent completed fiscal years were as follows:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2022\n2021\n2020\nNet sales:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFishing\n$\n526,582\u00a0\n$\n553,000\u00a0\n$\n449,878\u00a0\nCamping\n70,355\u00a0\n62,921\u00a0\n41,592\u00a0\nWatercraft Recreation\n67,940\u00a0\n66,603\u00a0\n41,857\u00a0\nDiving\n78,874\u00a0\n69,447\u00a0\n60,873\u00a0\nOther / Eliminations\n(396)\n(320)\n9\u00a0\n\u00a0\n$\n743,355\u00a0\n$\n751,651\u00a0\n$\n594,209\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2022\n2021\n2020\nOperating profit (loss):\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFishing\n$\n65,433\u00a0\n$\n122,490\u00a0\n$\n95,884\u00a0\nCamping\n13,415\u00a0\n14,025\u00a0\n4,406\u00a0\nWatercraft Recreation\n6,173\u00a0\n9,173\u00a0\n(329)\nDiving\n4,705\u00a0\n1,530\u00a0\n(2,576)\nOther / Eliminations\n(23,416)\n(35,935)\n(26,315)\n\u00a0\n$\n66,310\u00a0\n$\n111,283\u00a0\n$\n71,070\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSee Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report for the definition of segment net sales and operating profit.\nFiscal 2022 vs. Fiscal 2021\nNet Sales\nNet sales in fiscal 2022 decreased by 1% to $743,355 compared to $751,651 in fiscal 2021.  Foreign currency exchange had an unfavorable impact of less than 1% on the current year\u2019s sales versus the prior year.\nNet sales for the Fishing business decreased by $26,418, or 5% during fiscal 2022 from fiscal 2021.\u00a0 While customer and consumer demand was strong, the decrease over the prior year was driven by significant supply chain disruptions and the resulting unavailability of certain necessary components (especially as it related to electronic components) experienced in the current year, which impacted the ability to complete product build and fill customer orders.  Specifically, due to the technical and electronic nature of the product categories, the Fishing segment has been the most susceptible to the previously discussed supply chain issues, as discussed in \"Coronavirus (COVID-19)\" above.  \nCamping net sales increased $7,434, or 12%, in 2022 from 2021.\u00a0 Increased sales of Eureka and Jetboil products as a result of continued participation in outdoor recreation activities were the primary driver of the increase year over year.  \nNet sales in the Watercraft Recreation business increased $1,337, or 2%.  Continued new product success drove the overall increase over the prior year.  \n19\nTable of Contents\nDiving net sales increased $9,427, or 14%, year over year.  Prior year sales were negatively impacted due to the negative effects of COVID-19 on demand due to restrictions in destination travel and tourism.  As several regions around the world have re-opened, sales volumes have increased along with the increase in tourism, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact on sales in these segment of approximately 4.5% in 2022 versus the prior year period.\nCost of Sales\n\u00a0\nCost of sales was $472,023, or 63.5% of net sales, on a consolidated basis for fiscal 2022 compared to $417,526, or 55.5% of net sales, in the prior year.\u00a0 Despite the decrease in sales over the prior fiscal year, the increase in cost of sales was primarily driven by significant increases in materials costs between years.  The Company continues to manage disruptions in its supply chain to ensure the availability of necessary components, parts and other raw materials, in some cases at significantly higher price points than what was historically paid, to try to meet sales demand for our products across segments. \nGross Profit\n\u00a0\nGross profit of $271,332 was 36.5% of net sales on a consolidated basis for the year ended September\u00a030, 2022 compared to $334,125, or 44.5% of net sales in the prior year. \nGross profit in the Fishing business decreased by $66,217 from the prior year due primarily to the 5% decrease in net sales year over year, as well as significant increases in materials costs, as discussed above.  \nCamping gross profit increased by $1,857 from 2021 due primarily to increased sales volumes, pricing actions and a favorable mix of products sold in the current year as compared to the prior year.\nGross profit in the Watercraft Recreation segment decreased by $2,525 from 2021, despite increased sales in 2022 versus the prior year, primarily due to increased materials and freight costs.\nThe $4,169 increase in gross profit in the Diving segment was due primarily to increased sales volumes and pricing actions during fiscal 2022 as compared to the prior year.\nOperating Expenses\n\u00a0\nOperating expenses decreased from the prior year by $17,820.\u00a0 The decrease was primarily due to the impact of overall lower sales volume-driven expenses, as well as lower variable and deferred compensation expense incurred in fiscal 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year.  \nOperating expenses for the Fishing segment decreased by $9,160 from fiscal 2021 levels.\u00a0 The decrease was due primarily to lower sales volume related expenses between years.  \nCamping operating expenses increased by $2,467 from the prior year due primarily to increased sales volume related expenses and increased people costs.  \nIn the Watercraft Recreation segment, operating expenses increased $475 from their levels in fiscal 2021 due primarily to increased sales volume related expenses in 2022.\nOperating expenses for the Diving business increased by $993 year over year due primarily to increased sales volume related expenses between periods.\nThe Company's fiscal 2022 general corporate expenses of $23,722 decreased $12,595 from $36,317 in fiscal 2021.  The year over year decrease reflects lower people costs, including $11,200 of lower deferred compensation expenses, as well as lower incentive compensation and lower health insurance costs from the prior year.\nOperating Results\n\u00a0\nThe Company\u2019s operating profit was $66,310 in fiscal 2022 compared to an operating profit of $111,283 in fiscal 2021.\u00a0 Fishing operating profit decreased by $57,057 to $65,433 from $122,490 in the prior year due primarily to higher costs of goods and also lower sales volumes between years, stemming from supply chain disruptions, which were particularly acute in electronics.\u00a0 The operating profit for Camping was $13,415 compared to $14,025 in 2021 which decrease was primarily a result of the higher operating expenses between periods.\u00a0 The operating profit for the Watercraft Recreation business was $6,173 in fiscal 2022 compared to $9,173 in fiscal 2021 due to the factors noted above on changes in sales volumes and operating \n20\nTable of Contents\nexpenses.\u00a0 Operating profit for the Diving business increased by $3,175 in fiscal 2022 from fiscal 2021, due primarily to increased sales volumes and pricing actions.  \nOther Income and Expenses\n\u00a0\nInterest expense of $153 was relatively flat as compared to the prior year expense of $145. Interest income of $807 increased from prior year interest income of $366 due to the increase in deposit interest rates year over year.\u00a0 Net other expense of $8,076 in fiscal 2022 decreased from net other income of $1,418 in fiscal 2021.\u00a0 The current year net other expense included currency losses of $1,741 and market losses net of dividend income of $5,878 on deferred compensation plan assets.  In the prior year, net other income included $5,329 of market gains and dividends on the deferred compensation plan assets, partially offset by $215 of currency losses and pension termination expense of $2,526.\u00a0 The dividends and market gains and losses on deferred compensation plan assets recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in \u201cOther expense (income), net\u201d are offset as compensation expense in \u201cOperating expenses.\u201d\nPretax Income and Income Taxes\n\u00a0\nThe Company realized pretax income of $58,888 in fiscal 2022 compared to $112,922 in fiscal 2021. The Company recorded income tax expense of $14,397 in 2022, which equated to an effective tax rate of 24.4%, compared to $29,541 in 2021, which equated to an effective tax rate of 26.2%.\u00a0 \nNet Income\n\u00a0\nThe Company recognized net income of $44,491, or $4.37 per diluted common share, in fiscal 2022 compared to $83,381, or $8.21 per diluted common share, in fiscal 2021 based on the factors discussed above.\nFiscal 2021 vs. Fiscal 2020\nNet Sales\nNet sales in 2021 increased by 26% to $751,651 compared to $594,209 in 2020.  Foreign currency exchange had a favorable impact of less than 1%, on the fiscal 2021 sales versus the prior year.\nNet sales for the Fishing business increased by $103,122, or 23% during 2021 from 2020.\u00a0 The increase over fiscal 2020 was driven by continued new product success and increased participation in fishing, principally as a result of the effect of COVID-19 on consumer recreation and leisure choices, resulting in higher demand across all product lines in this segment.  \nCamping net sales increased $21,329, or 51%, in 2021 from 2020.\u00a0 Increased sales of consumer tents and Jetboil products as a result of increased participation in outdoor recreation activities were the primary driver of the increase year over year.  \nNet sales in the Watercraft Recreation business increased $24,746, or 59% from 2020 to 2021.  Increased demand as a result of increased participation in watercraft recreation activities during the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with new product success, drove the overall increase between years.\nDiving net sales increased $8,574, or 14%, year over year.  Fiscal 2020 sales were negatively impacted due to the effects of COVID-19 on demand globally due to restrictions in destination travel and tourism.  As travel restrictions started to lift throughout fiscal 2021, tourism began to recover, resulting in increased demand and sales in this segment between years.  In addition, foreign currency translation favorably impacted sales by approximately 3.3% in 2021 versus 2020.\nCost of Sales\n\u00a0\nCost of sales was $417,526, or 55.5% of net sales, on a consolidated basis for fiscal 2021 compared to $329,216, or 55.4% of net sales, in fiscal 2020.  Higher sales volumes between years were the primary driver of the increase in the cost of sales between periods. Favorable product mix and pricing between fiscal years offset the impact of approximately $7,200 of additional tariffs on Chinese goods and components during fiscal 2021, as well as increased freight costs over fiscal 2020.  \nGross Profit\n\u00a0\nGross profit of $334,125 was 44.5% of net sales on a consolidated basis for the year ended October 1, 2021 compared to $264,993, or 44.6% of net sales in fiscal 2020. \n21\nTable of Contents\nGross profit in the Fishing business in fiscal 2021 increased by $39,676 from fiscal 2020 due primarily to the 23% increase in net sales year over year. Favorable product mix and improved absorption of overhead costs during fiscal 2021 partially offset approximately $5,900 of additional tariff costs on Chinese sourced goods and components and higher freight costs incurred during fiscal 2021 versus fiscal 2020.\nCamping gross profit increased by $11,497 from 2020 due primarily to increased sales volumes, pricing actions and a favorable mix of products sold in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020.\nGross profit in the Watercraft Recreation segment increased by $12,289 from fiscal 2020 due primarily to increased sales volumes in fiscal 2021 versus the prior year and the resulting improvement in absorption of overhead costs.\nThe $5,463 increase in gross profit in the Diving segment was due primarily to increased sales volumes, pricing actions and favorable product mix during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020.\nOperating Expenses\n\u00a0\nOperating expenses increased in fiscal 2021 from fiscal 2020 by $28,919.\u00a0 The increase was driven primarily by higher sales volume related costs incurred in fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year.  Additionally, increased headcount and compensation costs further increased expenses year over year.\nOperating expenses for the Fishing segment increased by $13,069 from fiscal 2020 levels.\u00a0 The increase was due primarily to higher sales volume related expenses, as well as increased people costs between years.  \nCamping operating expenses increased by $1,879 in fiscal 2021 from the prior year due primarily to increased sales volume related expenses.  \nIn the Watercraft Recreation segment, operating expenses increased $2,787 in fiscal 2021 from their levels in fiscal 2020 due primarily to increased sales volume related expenses in 2021, partially offset by decreased spending rate on advertising and promotions.  \nOperating expenses for the Diving business increased by $1,357 year over year due primarily to increased sales volume related expenses, as well as increased people costs between periods.\nThe Company's 2021 general corporate expenses of $36,317 increased $9,827 from $26,490 in 2020.  The year over year increase reflects higher people costs including $2,900 of higher deferred compensation expenses and higher health insurance costs over the prior year as well as higher professional services expense.\nOperating Results\n\u00a0\nThe Company\u2019s operating profit was $111,283 in fiscal 2021 compared to an operating profit of $71,070 in fiscal 2020.\u00a0 Fishing operating profit increased by $26,606 to $122,490 from $95,884 in the prior year due primarily to higher sales volumes between years.\u00a0 The operating profit for Camping was $14,025 compared to $4,406 in 2020 which increase was also primarily a result of higher sales volumes between periods.\u00a0 The operating profit for the Watercraft Recreation business was $9,173 in fiscal 2021 compared to a loss of $329 in fiscal 2020 due to the factors noted above on changes in sales volumes and operating expenses.\u00a0 Operating profit for the Diving business increased by $4,106 in fiscal 2021 from fiscal 2020, due to recovery from the impact of COVID-19 and demand for our Diving products and the other factors discussed above.  \nOther Income and Expenses\n\u00a0\nInterest expense in fiscal 2021 of $145 was relatively flat as compared to the prior year expense of $143. Interest income of $366 decreased from fiscal 2020 year interest income of $1,413 due to the decrease in deposit interest rates year over year.\u00a0 Net other income of $1,418 in fiscal 2021 increased slightly from net other income of $1,362 in fiscal 2020.\u00a0 Fiscal 2021 net other income included currency losses of $215 and market gains and dividends of $5,329 on deferred compensation plan assets, partially offset by pension termination expense of $2,526.  In fiscal 2020, net other income included $269 of currency losses and $2,454 of market gains and dividends on the deferred compensation plan assets.\u00a0 The dividends and market gains and losses on deferred compensation plan assets recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in \u201cOther income, net\u201d are offset as compensation expense in \u201cOperating expenses.\u201d\nPretax Income and Income Taxes\n\u00a0\n22\nTable of Contents\nThe Company realized pretax income of $112,922 in fiscal 2021 compared to $73,702 in fiscal 2020. The Company recorded income tax expense of $29,541 in fiscal 2021, which equated to an effective tax rate of 26.2%, compared to $18,469 in fiscal 2020, which equated to an effective tax rate of 25.1%.\u00a0 \nNet Income\n\u00a0\nThe Company recognized net income of $83,381, or $8.21 per diluted common share, in fiscal 2021 compared to $55,233, or $5.47 per diluted common share, in fiscal 2020 based on the factors discussed above.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company believes its existing balances of cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchase requirements, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next twelve months. The Company currently anticipates the cash used for future dividends will come from its current cash and cash generated from ongoing operating activities.\nThe Company considers all short-term investments in interest-bearing bank accounts, and all securities and other instruments with an original maturity of three months or less, to be equivalent to cash.  Short-term investments in prior years consisted of certificates of deposit, with original maturities greater than three months but less than one year, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company\u2019s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade.\nThe Company\u2019s cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, are summarized in the following table:\nYear Ended\n(thousands)\nSeptember 30\n2022\nOctober 1\n2021\nOctober 2\n2020\nCash (used for) provided by :\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOperating activities\n$\n(62,144)\n$\n58,318\u00a0\n$\n61,493\u00a0\nInvesting activities\n(31,678)\n(21,381)\n(15,587)\nFinancing activities\n(12,233)\n(9,033)\n(7,107)\nEffect of foreign currency rate changes on cash\n(4,590)\n107\u00a0\n1,256\u00a0\n(Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n(110,645)\n$\n28,011\u00a0\n$\n40,055\u00a0\nOperating Activities\nThe following table sets forth the Company\u2019s working capital position at the end of each of the years shown:\n(thousands, except share data)\nSeptember 30\n2022\nOctober 1\n2021\nCurrent assets\n$\n480,316\u00a0\n$\n491,264\u00a0\nCurrent liabilities\n114,713\u00a0\n137,570\u00a0\nWorking capital\n$\n365,603\u00a0\n$\n353,694\u00a0\nCurrent ratio\n4.2:1\n3.6:1\nCash flows used for operations in fiscal 2022 totaled $62,144, and cash provided by operations totaled $58,318 and $61,493 in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively.  The change in operating cash flow from the prior year is due primarily to a decrease in net income, as well as increases in inventory levels and other working capital changes.\nDepreciation and amortization charges were $14,234, $13,401 and $14,926 in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows used for investing activities were $31,678, $21,381, and $15,587 in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.  There were no sales or purchases of short-term investments in fiscal 2022, 2021 or 2020.  Expenditures for property, plant and equipment were $31,690, $21,409 and $15,600 in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  The increase from the prior year is due primarily to additional capacity investments made in the current year.  In general, the Company\u2019s ongoing capital expenditures are primarily related to tooling for new products, facilities investments and information systems improvements.\n23\nTable of Contents\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows used for financing activities totaled $12,233 in fiscal 2022 compared to $9,033 and $7,107 in 2021 and 2020, respectively, and were primarily for the payment of dividends of $12,056 and $8,400 in 2022 and 2021, respectively.  In 2020, dividend payments totaled $6,773.  \nContractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company has contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments under its operating leases and open purchase orders.\u00a0 There have been no changes outside of the ordinary course of business in the specified contractual obligations during the year ended September\u00a030, 2022.\nThe Company utilizes letters of credit primarily as security for the payment of future claims under its workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Letters of credit outstanding at September\u00a030, 2022 and October\u00a01, 2021 were $173 and $181, respectively, and were included in the Company\u2019s total loan availability.\u00a0 The Company had no unsecured revolving credit facilities at its foreign subsidiaries as of September\u00a030, 2022 or October\u00a01, 2021.\nThe Company has no other off-balance sheet arrangements.  \nMarket Risk Management\nCoronavirus outbreak\nAs disclosed in our prior filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and elsewhere herein, in December 2019, a new strain of coronavirus (\"COVID-19\"), began to spread globally, leaving no region or part of the world unaffected by the pandemic it has created.  Governments and health authorities took measures to prevent the spread of this virus (including in certain cases requiring or recommending a vaccine or imposing testing requirements), all of which impacted the Company's business and operations. To the extent that COVID-19 continues to persist or recur, among other things, the ability of the Company\u2019s suppliers to manufacture and deliver the products that it sells to the Company, the ability of the Company to manufacture and deliver its products to its customers, the Company's ability to display its products at trade shows and similar events, the Company's ability to conduct meetings with its customers and prospective customers, and, if a significant number of its employees at a particular facility or location were to contract coronavirus, the Company\u2019s ability to conduct its day-to-day operations could be adversely impacted. The financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the Company will depend on future developments, including related to any supply chain disruptions, that the Company cannot reasonably predict or estimate at this time, but any of which could materially and adversely affect its results for an unknown but possibly extended period.  See the section \"Risk Factors\" identified in Part I, Item 1A in this Form 10-K for more information.  \nForeign Exchange Risk\nThe Company has significant foreign operations, for which the functional currencies are denominated primarily in euros, Swiss francs, Hong Kong dollars and Canadian dollars. As the values of the currencies of the foreign countries in which the Company has operations increase or decrease relative to the U.S. dollar, the sales, expenses, profits, losses, assets and liabilities of the Company\u2019s foreign operations, as reported in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements, increase or decrease, accordingly.\u00a0 Approximately 13% of the Company\u2019s revenues for the fiscal year ended September\u00a030, 2022 were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\u00a0 Approximately 4% were denominated in euros and approximately 6% were denominated in Canadian dollars, with the remaining 3% denominated in various other foreign currencies.\u00a0 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can cause unexpected financial losses or cash flow needs.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company operates in a seasonal business and experiences significant fluctuations in operating cash flow as working capital needs increase in advance of the Company\u2019s primary selling and cash generation season, and decline as accounts receivable are collected and cash is accumulated.\u00a0 \nCommodities\nCertain components used in the Company\u2019s products are exposed to commodity price changes. The Company manages this risk through instruments such as purchase orders and non-cancellable supply contracts. Primary commodity price exposures include costs associated with metals, resins and packaging materials.\n24\nTable of Contents\nImpact of Inflation\nThe Company anticipates that changing costs of basic raw materials (including due to inflationary conditions in the economy) may impact future operating costs and, accordingly, the prices of its products. The Company is involved in continuing programs to mitigate the impact of cost increases through changes in product design and identification of sourcing and manufacturing efficiencies. Price increases and, in certain situations, price decreases are implemented for individual products, when appropriate.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost.\u00a0 \nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe Company\u2019s management discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.\u00a0 The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of its assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related footnote disclosures.\u00a0 On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates for product returns, bad debts, inventories, long lived assets and goodwill, income taxes, warranty obligations, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, litigation and other subjective matters impacting the financial statements.\u00a0 The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\u00a0 Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.\u00a0 Management has discussed these policies with the Audit Committee of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAllowances for doubtful accounts are estimated by the individual operating companies based on estimates of losses related to customer accounts receivable balances.\u00a0 Estimates are developed by using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses, adjusting for current economic conditions and, in some cases, evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss. The establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances. Though the Company considers these balances adequate and proper, changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which the Company operates and any specific customer collection issues the Company identifies could have a favorable or unfavorable effect on required reserve balances.\nInventories\nThe Company values inventory at the lower of cost (determined using the first-in first-out method) or net realizable value. Management\u2019s judgment is required to determine the reserve for obsolete or excess inventory. Inventory on hand may exceed future demand either because the product is outdated or because the amount on hand is more than will be used to meet future needs. Inventory reserves are estimated by the individual operating companies using standard quantitative measures based on criteria established by the Company. The Company also considers current forecast plans, as well as market and industry conditions in establishing reserve levels. Though the Company considers these reserve balances to be adequate, changes in economic conditions, customer inventory levels or competitive conditions could have a favorable or unfavorable effect on required reserve balances.\nDeferred Taxes\nThe Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should the Company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets Impairment\n25\nTable of Contents\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired.\u00a0 Generally, annual impairment tests are performed by the Company in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.\nIn assessing the recoverability of the Company\u2019s goodwill, the Company estimates the fair value of the businesses to which the goodwill relates.\u00a0 Fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis.\u00a0 If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its net book value, no impairment exists. When fair value is less than the carrying value of the net assets and related goodwill, an impairment charge is recognized based on the excess of carrying amount over its fair value.\u00a0 The Company did not recognize any goodwill impairment charges in 2022, 2021 or 2020. \nThe discounted cash flow analysis used to estimate fair value requires a number of key estimates and assumptions.\u00a0 The Company estimates the future cash flows of the reporting units based on historical and forecasted revenues and operating costs and applies a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for purposes of the valuation.\u00a0 This discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital, which includes certain assumptions made by management such as market capital structure, market betas, the risk-free rate of return and the estimated costs of borrowing.\u00a0 Changes in these key estimates and assumptions, or in other assumptions used in this process, could materially affect our impairment analysis in a given year.\nIn assessing the recoverability of the Company\u2019s other indefinite lived intangible assets, the Company estimates the fair value of the various intangible assets.\u00a0 The fair value of trademarks and patents is estimated using the relief from royalty method.\u00a0 If the fair value of an intangible asset exceeds its net book value, no impairment exists. When fair value is less than the carrying value of the intangible asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount of the difference.\u00a0 \nA number of factors, many of which the Company has no ability to control, could affect its financial condition, operating results and business prospects and could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions that the Company uses in preparing its financial statements.\u00a0 These factors include:\u00a0 a prolonged global economic crisis, a significant decrease in demand for the Company\u2019s products, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator and successful efforts by the Company\u2019s competitors to gain market share.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of\nThe Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as unplanned negative cash flow indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If such assets are determined to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Application of alternative assumptions, such as changes in the estimate of future cash flows, could produce significantly different results. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change.\nWarranties\nThe Company accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services. Warranty reserves are estimated using standard quantitative measures based on criteria established by the Company. Estimates of costs to service its warranty obligations are based on historical experience, expectation of future conditions and known product issues. To the extent the Company experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims, revisions to the estimated warranty reserve would be required. The Company engages in product quality programs and processes, including monitoring and evaluating the quality of its suppliers, to help minimize warranty obligations.", "item7a": ">ITEM 7A.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInformation with respect to this item is included in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the heading \u201cMarket Risk Management.\u201d", "companyName": "Johnson Outdoors Inc", "cusip": "478160104"}
