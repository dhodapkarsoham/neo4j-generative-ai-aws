{"item1": ">Item\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0Business\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\nBank of Hawaii Corporation (the \u201cParent\u201d) is a Delaware corporation and a bank holding company (\u201cBHC\u201d) headquartered in Honolulu, Hawaii.\u00a0\u00a0The Parent\u2019s principal operating subsidiary, Bank\u00a0of Hawaii (the \u201cBank\u201d), was organized on December\u00a017, 1897, and is chartered by the State of Hawaii.\u00a0\u00a0The Bank\u2019s deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the \u201cFDIC\u201d) and the Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\nThe Bank, directly and through its subsidiaries, provides a broad range of financial products and services primarily to customers in Hawaii, Guam, and other Pacific Islands.\u00a0\u00a0References to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d refer to the Parent and its subsidiaries and are consolidated for financial reporting purposes.\u00a0\u00a0The Bank\u2019s subsidiaries are identified in Exhibit 21.1 to this Form 10-K and include, among others, Bank of Hawaii Leasing,\u00a0Inc., Bankoh Investment Services,\u00a0Inc., and Pacific Century Life Insurance Corporation.\u00a0\u00a0The Bank\u2019s subsidiaries are engaged in equipment leasing, securities brokerage, investment advisory services, and providing credit insurance.\n\n\nWe are organized into three business segments for management reporting purposes: Consumer Banking, Commercial Banking, and Treasury and Other.\u00a0\u00a0See Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d) and Note\u00a013 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\n\n\nOur annual report on Form\u00a010-K, quarterly reports on Form\u00a010-Q, current reports on Form\u00a08-K, and all amendments to those reports can be found free of charge on our website at www.boh.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d).\u00a0\u00a0The SEC maintains a website, www.sec.gov, which contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.\u00a0\u00a0Our Corporate Governance Guidelines; charters of the Audit and Risk Committee, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee; and our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics are available on our website at

96813.\n\n\nCompetition\n\n\nThe Company operates in a highly competitive environment subject to intense competition from traditional financial service providers including banks, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage companies, finance companies, mutual funds, brokerage firms, insurance companies, and other non-traditional providers of financial services including financial service subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies.\u00a0\u00a0Some of our competitors are not subject to the same level of regulation and oversight that is required of banks and BHCs, and receive favorable tax treatment.\u00a0\u00a0As a result, some of our competitors may have lower cost structures.\u00a0\u00a0Also, some of our competitors, through delivery channels such as the Internet, may be based outside of the markets that we serve.\u00a0\u00a0By emphasizing our extensive branch network, exceptional service levels, and knowledge of local trends and conditions, the Company believes it has developed a competitive advantage in its market.\n\n\nSupervision and Regulation\n\n\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal and state governmental authorities.\u00a0\u00a0The regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors, customers, and the integrity of the U.S. banking system and capital markets.\u00a0\u00a0The following information describes some of the more significant laws and regulations applicable to us.\u00a0\u00a0The descriptions below are qualified in their entirety by reference to the applicable laws and regulations.\u00a0\u00a0Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently raised in Congress, in state legislatures, and with the various bank regulatory agencies.\u00a0\u00a0Changes in applicable laws or regulations, or a change in the way such laws or regulations are interpreted by regulatory agencies or courts, may have a material impact on our business, operations, and earnings.\n\n\nThe Parent\n\n\nThe Parent is registered as a BHC under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the \u201cBHC Act\u201d), and is subject to the supervision of and to examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (the \u201cFRB\u201d).\u00a0\u00a0The Parent is also registered as a financial institution holding company under the Hawaii Code of Financial Institutions (the \u201cCode\u201d) and is subject to the registration, reporting, and examination requirements of the Code.\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe BHC Act prohibits, with certain exceptions, a BHC from acquiring direct or indirect beneficial ownership or control of either a company that is not a bank, or more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank, without the FRB\u2019s prior approval.\u00a0\u00a0A BHC is generally prohibited from engaging in any activity other than banking, managing or controlling banks or other subsidiaries authorized under the BHC Act, or an activity that the FRB has determined to be so closely related to those activities as to be a proper incident to one of them.\n\n\nUnder FRB policy, a BHC is expected to serve as a source of financial and management strength to its subsidiary bank(s).\u00a0\u00a0A BHC is also expected to commit resources to support its subsidiary bank(s) in circumstances where it might not do so absent such a policy.\u00a0\u00a0Under this policy, a BHC is expected to maintain reliable funding and contingency plans to stand ready to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary bank(s) during periods of financial adversity and to maintain the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary bank(s).\n\n\nUnder the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the \u201cRiegle-Neal Act\u201d) banks and BHCs from any state are permitted to acquire banks located in any other state, subject to certain conditions, including certain nationwide and state-imposed deposit concentration limits.\u00a0\u00a0Banks also have the ability, subject to certain restrictions, to acquire branches outside their home states by acquisition or merger under the Riegle-Neal Act.\u00a0\u00a0The establishment of new interstate branches is also possible in those states with laws that expressly permit de novo branching.\u00a0\u00a0Because the Code permits de novo branching by out-of-state banks, those banks may establish new branches in Hawaii.\n\n\nBank of Hawaii\n\n\nThe Bank is subject to extensive federal, state, territorial and foreign regulations that significantly affect its business and activities.\u00a0\u00a0The Bank is subject to supervision of the FRB and examination by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the \u201cCFPB\u201d), and the State of Hawaii Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs\u2019 (\u201cDCCA\u201d) Division of Financial Institutions.\u00a0\u00a0These regulatory bodies have broad authority to implement standards and to initiate proceedings designed to prohibit depository institutions from engaging in activities that may represent \u201cunsafe\u201d or \u201cunsound\u201d banking practices or constitute violations of applicable laws, rules, regulations, administrative orders, or written agreements with regulators.\u00a0\u00a0The standards relate to, among other compliance matters, operations and management, asset quality, interest rate exposure, capital, executive compensation, and consumer protection.\u00a0\u00a0The regulatory bodies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards, including the assessment of civil monetary penalties and restitution, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, and other actions, up to and including revocation of a bank\u2019s charter for the most severe infractions, or putting such a bank into receivership if it is not financially viable.\n\n\nBankoh Investment Services,\u00a0Inc., the broker-dealer and investment adviser subsidiary of the Bank, is incorporated in Hawaii and is regulated by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the DCCA\u2019s Insurance Division.\u00a0\u00a0Pacific Century Life Insurance Corporation is incorporated in Arizona and is primarily regulated by the State of Arizona Department of Insurance.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe Dodd Frank Act\n\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) and its regulations, among other things, mandated capital and liquidity requirements, established standards for mortgage lenders, regulated executive and incentive-based compensation, imposed various consumer protections and numerous other provisions.\u00a0\u00a0Provisions also limit or place significant burdens and costs on activities traditionally conducted by banking organizations, such as arranging and participating in swap and derivative transactions, proprietary trading and investing in private equity and other funds.\n\n\nSeveral provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act were significantly changed by enactment of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act in May 2018, notably by eliminating the requirement for institutions like the Company to perform and publicly disclose periodic stress tests.\u00a0\u00a0The Company continues to monitor and implement rules, regulations, and interpretations of the Dodd-Frank Act as they are adopted and modified, and to evaluate their application to our current and future operations.\n\n\nCapital Requirements\n\n\nIn July 2013, the FRB, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the \u201cOCC\u201d) and the FDIC adopted new capital rules (the \u201cRules\u201d).\u00a0\u00a0These Rules were designed to help ensure that banks maintain strong capital positions by increasing both the quantity and quality of capital held by U.S. banking organizations.\u00a0\u00a0The Rules reflect, in part, certain standards initially adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2010 (which are commonly called \u201cBasel III\u201d standards) as well as requirements by the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (\u201cFDICIA\u201d) identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions: \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d \u201cadequately capitalized,\u201d \u201cundercapitalized,\u201d \u201csignificantly undercapitalized,\u201d and \u201ccritically undercapitalized.\u201d\n\n\nThe federal banking agencies are authorized by FDICIA to impose progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the capital category in which an institution is classified.\u00a0\u00a0These \u201cprompt corrective actions\u201d can include: requiring an insured depository institution to adopt a capital restoration plan guaranteed by the institution\u2019s parent company; placing limits on asset growth and restrictions on activities, including restrictions on transactions with affiliates; restricting the interest rates the institution may pay on deposits; prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt; prohibiting the holding company from making capital distribution without prior regulatory approval; and ultimately appointing a receiver for the institution.\n\n\nA \u201cwell capitalized\u201d institution must have a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier\u00a01 Capital Ratio of at least 8%, a Total Capital Ratio of at least 10%, a Tier\u00a01 Leverage Ratio of at least 5%, and not be subject to a capital directive order.\u00a0\u00a0As of December\u00a031, 2021, the Bank was classified as \u201cwell capitalized.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0The classification of a depository institution under one of the categories set out above is primarily for the purpose of applying the prompt corrective actions, and is not intended to be, nor should it be interpreted as, a representation of the overall financial condition or the prospects of that financial institution.\u00a0\u00a0See Note\u00a011 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\n\n\nDividend Restrictions\n\n\nThe Parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank.\u00a0\u00a0The Parent\u2019s principal source of funds to pay dividends on its common stock and to service its liabilities is dividends from the Bank.\u00a0\u00a0Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends the Bank may pay to the Parent without regulatory approval.\u00a0\u00a0The FRB is authorized to determine the circumstances when the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit such payments.\u00a0\u00a0The right of the Parent, its shareholders, and creditors to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of its subsidiaries is also subject to the prior claims of creditors of those subsidiaries.\u00a0\u00a0For information regarding the limitations on the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to the Parent, see Note\u00a011 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n\nTransactions with Affiliates and Insiders\n\n\nTransactions between the Bank and any affiliate are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act.\u00a0\u00a0An affiliate of the Bank is any company or entity which controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the Bank which is not a subsidiary of the Bank.\u00a0\u00a0Under federal law, the Bank is subject to restrictions that limit the transfer of funds or other items of value to the Parent, and any other non-bank affiliates in \u201ccovered transactions.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0In general, covered transactions include making loans to an affiliate, the purchase of or investment in the securities issued by an affiliate, the purchase of assets from an affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate as collateral security for a loan or extensions of credit to any person or company, the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate, or certain transactions with an affiliate that involve the borrowing or lending of securities and certain derivative transactions with an affiliate.\n\n\nUnless an exemption applies, covered transactions by the Bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10% of the Bank\u2019s capital and surplus, and with respect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate, they are limited to 20% of the Bank\u2019s capital and surplus.\u00a0\u00a0Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve Regulation W also require that certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving other non-affiliated persons.\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve Regulation O place restrictions and certain reporting requirements on any extension of credit made by a member bank to (a) an executive officer, director, or principal shareholder of the bank, or any company of which the bank is a subsidiary, and of any other subsidiary of that company, and (b) a company controlled by such a person, or to a political or campaign committee that benefits or is controlled by such a person (collectively referred to as \u201cinsiders\u201d).\u00a0\u00a0These restrictions include limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such loans can be made.\u00a0\u00a0There is also an aggregate limitation on all loans to insiders and their related interests.\u00a0\u00a0Certain restrictions also extend to extensions of credit made to an executive officer, directors, or principal shareholder of a bank (or to a related interest of such person) by a correspondent bank.\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Volcker Rule\n\n\nIn December 2013, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, the SEC, and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission issued final rules to implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act commonly known as the \u201cVolker Rule.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0The Volcker Rule, as amended on August 20, 2019, generally prohibits U.S. banks from engaging in proprietary trading and restricts those banking entities from sponsoring, investing in, or having certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds.\u00a0\u00a0The prohibitions under the Volcker Rule are subject to a number of statutory exemptions, restrictions, and definitions.\u00a0\u00a0The Volcker Rule has not had a material impact on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements, but we continue to evaluate its application to our current and future operations.\n\n\nFDIC Insurance\n\n\nThe FDIC provides insurance coverage for certain deposits held by the Bank through the Deposit Insurance Fund, which the FDIC maintains by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium.\u00a0\u00a0The Bank is assessed deposit insurance premiums by the FDIC using a risk-based assessment rate and an adjusted average total assets.\u00a0\u00a0The Bank\u2019s FDIC insurance assessment was $6.5 million in 2021, $5.8 million in 2020, and $5.2 million in 2019.\n\n\nA depository institution\u2019s deposit insurance may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution\u2019s financial condition is unsafe or unsound, or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, or has violated any applicable rule, regulation, or order or condition enacted or imposed by a regulatory agency.\u00a0\u00a0Termination of the Bank\u2019s deposit insurance would end its ability to function as a commercial bank in Hawaii.\n\n\nDepositor Preference\n\n\nIn the event of the \u201cliquidation or other resolution\u201d of an insured depository institution, claims of insured and uninsured depositors for deposits payable in the United States (including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors), plus certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured creditors including, in the case of the Bank, the Parent.\n\n\nOther Safety and Soundness Regulations\n\n\nThe federal banking agencies also have adopted guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards.\u00a0\u00a0These guidelines establish general standards for internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings standards, compensation, fees and benefits.\u00a0\u00a0In general, the guidelines require appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines before capital becomes impaired.\n\n\nCommunity Reinvestment and Consumer Protection Laws\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 \n\n\n\n\nCommunity Reinvestment.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (\u201cCRA\u201d) requires the appropriate federal banking agency, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess the bank\u2019s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the bank, including low and moderate income neighborhoods.\u00a0\u00a0Under the CRA, institutions are assigned a rating of \u201coutstanding,\u201d \u201csatisfactory,\u201d \u201cneeds to improve,\u201d or \u201csubstantial non-compliance.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0The regulatory assessment of the bank\u2019s record is made available to the public.\u00a0\u00a0Further, these assessments are considered by regulators when evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open, close, or relocate a branch or facility.\u00a0\u00a0The Bank\u2019s current CRA rating is \u201coutstanding\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 \n\n\n\n\nConsumer Protection Laws.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn addition to the CRA, the Bank is subject to a number of federal laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population in connection with its lending activities.\u00a0\u00a0These include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.\n\n\nFederal banking regulators, pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, have enacted regulations limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic consumer information to non-affiliated third parties.\u00a0\u00a0The regulations require disclosure of privacy policies and allow consumers to prevent certain personal information from being shared with non-affiliated third parties.\u00a0\u00a0The Fair and Accurate Credit Transaction Act (\u201cFACT Act\u201d) requires financial institutions to develop and implement an identity theft prevention program to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft \u201cred flags\u201d to reduce the risk that customer information will be misused to conduct fraudulent financial transactions.\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA number of other federal and state consumer protection laws extensively govern the Bank\u2019s relationship with its customers.\u00a0\u00a0These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act and these laws\u2019 respective state-law counterparts, as well as state and territorial usury laws and laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices. \n \nThese and other laws subject the Bank to substantial regulatory oversight and, among other things, require disclosures of the cost of credit and terms of deposit accounts, provide substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, provide financial privacy protections, prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive practices, and restrict the Bank\u2019s ability to raise interest rates.\n\n\nThe CFPB was created under the Dodd-Frank Act as an agency responsible for promulgating and enforcing regulations designed to protect consumers including adding prohibitions on unfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices.\u00a0\u00a0The CFPB, along with other prudential regulators and the Department of Justice, have also expanded the focus of their regulatory examinations and investigations to include \u201cfair and responsible banking.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Fair and responsible banking strives to provide equal credit opportunities to all applicants of a community, to prohibit discrimination by lenders on the basis of certain borrower characteristics, and to ensure that a bank\u2019s practices are not deceptive, unfair, or take unreasonable advantage of consumers or businesses.\u00a0\u00a0The enhanced focus encompasses the entire loan life cycle, including post-closing activities such as collections and servicing, and pre-application activities such as marketing and loan solicitation and origination.\n\n\nViolations of applicable consumer protection laws and regulations can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorneys\u2019 fees.\u00a0\u00a0Federal bank regulators, state attorneys general and state and local consumer protection agencies may also seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies, including regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, and civil money penalties.\u00a0\u00a0Failure to comply with consumer protection requirements may also result in our failure to obtain required bank regulatory approvals for transactions the Bank may wish to pursue, or prohibit us from engaging in such transactions even if approval is not required.\n\n\nBank Secrecy Act / Anti-Money Laundering Laws\n\n\nThe Bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001.\u00a0\u00a0The USA PATRIOT Act created new laws, regulations, and penalties, imposed significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, and expanded the application of those laws outside the U.S.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally, like all U.S. companies and individuals, the Company is prohibited from transacting business with certain individuals and entities named on the Office of Foreign Asset Control\u2019s list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons.\n\n\nThe Bank has been required to implement policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report potential money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of its customers.\u00a0\u00a0The Company maintains procedures and systems to identify its customers, and to monitor and block transactions related to prohibited persons and entities.\u00a0\u00a0Violations of these requirements can result in substantial civil and criminal sanctions.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the federal financial institution regulatory agencies consider the effectiveness of a financial institution\u2019s anti-money laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and BHC acquisitions.\n\n\nHuman Capital Management\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, we employed 2,056 full-time equivalent employees, of which 1,952 are located in the State of Hawaii, with the remainder located in Guam and other Pacific Islands.\u00a0\u00a0None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company values the contributions of all of its employees and is committed to building an active and connected employee community within the Company.\u00a0\u00a0Key areas of focus for the Company include: \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDiversity and Inclusion: The Company believes that a diverse and inclusive workforce fosters an environment where everyone can thrive and be successful.\u00a0\u00a0As of December 31, 2021, approximately 87% of our workforce are minorities (non-Caucasian) and approximately 63% of our workforce are female, which accounts for 45% and 56% of our senior leaders and managers, respectively.\u00a0\u00a0We conduct an external pay equity study periodically to evaluate that a gender pay gap does not exist.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEmployee Development and Training: The Company is committed to providing all employees with the opportunity to grow, connect and thrive within the Company.\u00a0\u00a0We foster a seamlessly collaborative, digitally connected workplace to support changing needs.  We enhance people leadership capability to deliver exceptional employee experience and develop our workforce of tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0Skills and professional development training is provided to employees at all levels, with additional development sessions specifically targeted to managers and leaders.\u00a0\u00a0Key initiatives included the launch of an enhanced Advanced Leaders program to elevate leadership capabilities, the development of a new and competitive Leadership Development Program, the first all virtual Pathways to Professional Excellence cohort with the largest enrollment of 35 employees and an improved online performance management process that allows the employee to own the first step of the performance review process.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo help maintain Hawaii\u2019s special culture of \n\u2018ohana\n and working together toward common goals, renewed attention was paid to engaging teammates during the pandemic, especially those working remotely.\u00a0\u00a0Based on employee feedback from surveys, special online sessions were created in 2021 to connect with employees and encourage collaboration.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cExec Connect\u201d launched in April 2021, giving employees opportunities to interact with members of the Executive Committee.\u00a0\u00a0Employees hear about high level strategies and share their own concerns and observations.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cExec Connect\u201d was a hit, and proved especially valuable in welcoming new employees, allowing them to familiarize themselves with key executives and other employees.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cRecruit Connect\u201d launched in July 2021 to help teammates identify job opportunities within the Company and find out more about them.  In some cases, sessions led to referred candidates joining the Bank, and to current employees finding a new career path.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cManager Excellence Forums\u201d launched in January 2021 as a platform connecting managers so that they can learn from and support one another when facing real management issues, and discuss practical solutions.\u00a0\u00a0Manager engagement has been key to navigating the pandemic environment, and these forums help managers stay connected and improve their management skills while moving forward with their teams.\u00a0\u00a0Forum topics are suggested by the participants, who meet every other month, and have included increasing employee morale, resilience, managing hybrid teams, self-care, and employee retention.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEmployee Benefits: The Company believes in enabling a healthy workforce and providing a benefits program that is designed to attract, retain, and motivate employees.\u00a0\u00a0In addition to competitive insurance, healthcare, and retirement offerings, examples of more innovative and workforce-specific benefits offerings include: mortgage discount program, student loan assistance program, fitness classes, well-being sessions, and personal finance education.\u00a0\u00a0During the pandemic, the Company enhanced their benefit offerings to include changes to the Retirement Savings Plan and medical benefits, and increased mental wellness resources.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHealth and Safety: The health and safety of our employees is a priority.  In 2021, our commitment to workplace safety and workforce health enabled the Company to maintain business and operational continuity without diminishing our focus on both employee and customer safety during the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0\u00a0Examples of specific initiatives to enhance on-site safety include daily employee health screening as well as temperature scanning and social distancing protocols in both office and branch locations.  We also invested in ventilation system upgrades and installed physical health guards/barriers.\u00a0\u00a0Employees who chose not to get COVID vaccinated, were required to complete COVID testing weekly.\u00a0\u00a0The Company paid for the testing, provided paid time off to complete the weekly testing, and secured on site testing arrangements for our employees. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInformation about our Executive Officers \n\n\nListed below are executive officers of the Parent.\n\n\nPeter S.

These local economies rely heavily on tourism, the U.S. military, real estate, construction, government, and other service-based industries.  Lower visitor arrivals or spending, real or threatened acts of war or terrorism, public unrest, increases in energy costs, the availability of affordable air transportation, climate change, natural disasters and adverse weather, public health issues including Asian air pollution and the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Federal, State of Hawaii and local government budget issues may impact consumer and corporate spending.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally, financial markets may be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including escalating military tension between Russia and Ukraine, terrorism or other geopolitical events.\n\n\nThe impacts of various travel restrictions and quarantine requirements for visitors to Hawaii has had a dramatic negative impact on tourism.\u00a0\u00a0These events have contributed to a significant deterioration in general economic conditions in our markets which has impacted and will continue to adversely impact us and our customers\u2019 operations.\u00a0\u00a0Though there has been an increase in tourism and economic recovery recently, many of the impacts in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands still linger. \n\n\nDeterioration of economic conditions, locally, nationally, and internationally could adversely affect the quality of our assets, credit losses, and the demand for our products and services, which could lead to lower revenues, higher expenses, and lower earnings.  The level of international visitor arrivals and spending, housing prices, and unemployment rates are some of the metrics that we continually monitor.  We also monitor the value of collateral, such as real estate, that secures the loans we have made.  The borrowing power of our customers could also be negatively impacted by a decline in the value of collateral.\n\n\nClimate change and the governmental responses to it could have a material adverse impact on the Bank and its customers\n\n\nThe impacts of climate change, such as extreme weather conditions, natural disasters and rising sea levels, could impact the Bank\u2019s operations as well as those of its customers and third party vendors upon which it relies.\u00a0\u00a0Such events could also result in market volatility or negatively impact our customers\u2019 ability to pay outstanding loans, or result in the deterioration of the value of our collateral causing a material adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s financial condition and results of operation.\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, increasing regulation related to climate change could have an adverse effect on the business and financial condition of the Bank and its customers, including our credit portfolio.\u00a0\u00a0Further legislation and regulatory requirements could increase the operating expenses of, or otherwise adversely impact, the Bank or its customers.\u00a0\u00a0To the extent that the Bank or its customers experience increases in costs, reductions in the value of assets, constraints on operations or similar concerns driven by changes in regulation relating to climate change, the Bank\u2019s business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the Hawaii economy and our business, the extent of the impact on our business and our financial results remains uncertain.\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.\u00a0\u00a0The duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects still cannot be determined with a reasonable level of certainty.\u00a0\u00a0We have experienced unprecedented levels of government stimulus in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and have seen certain economic activities recovering since 2020, however, the lasting impacts of which are unknown. \n\n\nNovel viruses such as COVID-19 increase concerns related to illness when traveling and gathering in large numbers.\u00a0\u00a0In response, the majority of the nation\u2019s state and local jurisdictions imposed various restrictions in order to control the spread of COVID-19.\u00a0\u00a0Though most of these restrictions have now been lifted there is the possibility that they could be imposed again in the future.\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEven as more and more individuals become fully vaccinated against COVID-19, prior t\nravel restrictions and mandatory quarantines related to the COVID-19 pandemic may have a lasting impact on tourism\n spending\n in Hawaii.\u00a0\u00a0Because many of our customers, both commercial and consumer, derive at least some of their income from tourism, this dramatic drop in tourism\n spending\n affects them directly, as well as the Hawaii economy as a whole.\u00a0\u00a0A downturn in the Hawaii economy \nand widespread reduction to our customers\u2019 income will have a negative impact on our operations.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe are unable to predict the \nextent to which the\n COVID-19\n pandemic and related impacts will continue to adversely affect our \nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition, \nr\negulatory capital\n,\n and liquidity ratios\n.\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, the institution of physical distancing, and shelter-in-place requirements resulted in both temporary and permanent closures of many businesses.  As a result, the demand for our products and services has been and may continue to be significantly impacted.\u00a0\u00a0Our operations may also be disrupted if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, due to illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0\u00a0We have already temporarily or permanently closed certain of our branches and offices and many employees are now working remotely.\u00a0\u00a0Though we have re-opened most of our branches, others remain closed.\n\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily suspended residential property foreclosure sales, evictions, and involuntary automobile repossessions.\u00a0\u00a0Foreclosures and evictions remain suspended.\u00a0\u00a0We continue to work with our customers as many of the initial assistance programs have now expired.\u00a0\u00a0The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations, financial condition, regulatory capital, and liquidity ratios will depend on the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, actions taken by governmental authorities, actions taken by other third parties in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the pace of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, all of which are highly uncertain.\n\n\nAny reduction in defense spending by the federal government could adversely impact the economy in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.\n\n\nThe U.S. military has a major presence in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.\u00a0\u00a0As a result, the U.S. military is an important aspect of the economies in which we operate.\u00a0\u00a0The funding of the U.S. military is subject to the overall U.S. Government budget and appropriation decisions and processes which are driven by numerous factors, including geo-political events, macroeconomic conditions, and the ability and willingness of the U.S. Government to enact legislation.\u00a0\u00a0U.S. Government appropriations have been and likely will continue to be affected by larger U.S. Government budgetary issues and related legislation.\u00a0\u00a0Cuts in defense and other security spending could have an adverse impact on the economies in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n\nChanges in interest rates could adversely impact our results of operations and capital.\n\n\nOur earnings are highly dependent on the spread between the interest earned on loans, leases, and investment securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings.\u00a0\u00a0We primarily rely on customer deposits as a sizable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds.\u00a0\u00a0Changes in market interest rates impact the rates earned on loans, leases, and investment securities and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, changes to market interest rates could impact the level of loans, leases, investment securities, deposits, and borrowings, and the credit profile of our current borrowers.\u00a0\u00a0Interest rates are affected by many factors beyond our control, and fluctuate in response to general economic conditions, currency fluctuations, and the monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities.\n\n\nChanges in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans and leases, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits, and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits.\u00a0\u00a0Any substantial prolonged change in market interest rates may negatively impact our ability to attract deposits, originate loans and leases, and achieve satisfactory interest rate spreads.\u00a0\u00a0If we are unable to continue to fund loans and other assets through customer deposits or access capital markets on favorable terms or if we otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectively, our liquidity, net interest margin, financial results and conditions may be adversely affected.\n\n\nCredit losses could increase if economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate further.\n\n\nIncreased credit losses for the Bank could result if economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate further.\u00a0\u00a0The risk of nonpayment on loans and leases is inherent in all lending activities.\u00a0\u00a0We maintain a reserve for credit losses to absorb estimated expected credit losses over the life of the loan, lease, and commitment portfolios as of the balance sheet date.\u00a0\u00a0Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the loan and lease portfolios in determining the level of the reserve for credit losses.\u00a0\u00a0Many of these assumptions are based on current economic conditions.\u00a0\u00a0Should economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate further nationally or in Hawaii, we may experience higher credit losses in future periods.\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInability of our borrowers to make timely repayments on their loans, or decreases in real estate collateral values may result in increased delinquencies, foreclosures, and customer bankruptcies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\n\n\nConsumer protection initiatives and court decisions related to the foreclosure process affect our remedies as a creditor.\n\n\nProposed consumer protection initiatives related to the foreclosure process, including voluntary and/or mandatory programs intended to permit or require lenders to consider loan modifications or other alternatives to foreclosure, could increase our credit losses or increase our expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor.\n\n\nIn addition, Hawaii\u2019s appellate courts have made rulings that increase the complexity and risk of nonjudicial, or out-of-court, foreclosures.\u00a0 At the same time, a chronic backlog of cases in the Hawaii courts has slowed the judicial foreclosure process, which delays the Bank\u2019s ability to take over, preserve, and sell the mortgaged property.\u00a0 The manner in which these issues are ultimately resolved could impact our foreclosure procedures and costs, which in turn could affect our financial condition or results of operations.\n\n\nChanges in the capital markets could materially affect the level of assets under management and the demand for our other fee-based services.\n\n\nChanges in the capital markets could affect the volume of income from and demand for our fee-based services.\u00a0\u00a0Our investment management revenues depend in large part on the level of assets under management.\u00a0\u00a0Market volatility that leads customers to liquidate investments or move investments to other institutions or asset classes, as well as lower asset values can reduce our level of assets under management, thereby decreasing our investment management revenues.\n\n\nThe Parent\u2019s liquidity is dependent on dividends from the Bank.\n\n\nThe Parent is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank.  The Parent receives substantially all of its cash in the form of dividends from the Bank.  These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay, dividends on the Parent\u2019s common stock or to repurchase common stock under the Parent\u2019s share repurchase program.  Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to the Parent.\u00a0\u00a0The Parent\u2019s ability to meet its obligations, pay dividends to shareholders, or repurchase stock, may be further limited if federal and state laws and regulations further limit the amount of dividends the Bank is permitted to pay the Parent.\n\n\nThere can be no assurance that the Parent will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock.\n\n\nDuring 2021, the Parent repurchased 328,832 shares of common stock at a total cost of $27.3 million under its share repurchase program.\u00a0\u00a0We suspended share repurchases from March 2020 to July 2021 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The actual amount and timing of future share repurchases, if any, will depend on market conditions, applicable SEC rules, and various other factors.\u00a0\u00a0The Parent also paid cash dividends of $110.6 million on common shares during 2021.\u00a0\u00a0In January 2022, the Parent\u2019s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share on the Parent\u2019s outstanding common shares.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOur dividend payments and/or stock repurchases may change from time-to-time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends and/or repurchase stock in any particular amounts or at all.\u00a0\u00a0Dividends and/or stock repurchases are subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors.\u00a0\u00a0We continue to evaluate the potential impact that regulatory proposals may have on our liquidity and capital management strategies, including Basel III and those required under the Dodd-Frank Act.\u00a0\u00a0The actual amount and timing of future dividends and share repurchases, if any, will depend on market and economic conditions, applicable SEC rules, federal and state regulatory restrictions, and various other factors.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the amount we spend and the number of shares we are able to repurchase under our stock repurchase program may further be affected by a number of other factors, including the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares.\u00a0\u00a0A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases could have a negative effect on our stock price.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to Regulatory Changes\n\n\nThe end of LIBOR may adversely affect our financial instruments that are directly or indirectly tied to LIBOR. \n\n\nOn March 5, 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, confirmed that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or will no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021 for 1-week and 2-month US dollar LIBOR and immediately after June 30, 2023 for all remaining US dollar LIBOR settings.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, U.S. banking regulatory agencies issued guidance encouraging banks to cease entering into new contracts that use U.S. dollar LIBOR as a reference rate by December 31, 2021.\u00a0\u00a0At the same time, various alternative rates, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), have begun to be used more widely in both loan and derivative products.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have loans, derivative contracts, and other financial instruments with rates that are either directly or indirectly tied to LIBOR.\u00a0\u00a0As the transition progresses, the interest rates on these instruments, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with the same, may be adversely affected.\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers, could adversely impact our reputation.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company formed an enterprise-wide, cross-functional project team to oversee the transition.\u00a0\u00a0The project team reports to a steering committee as well as Management and the Board on a periodic basis.\u00a0\u00a0The project team is organized around key work streams, which cover the products, systems, and operational processes impacted by the transition as well as client communication.\u00a0\u00a0Since its formation, the project team has completed an inventory of existing LIBOR-indexed products, which is monitored on an ongoing basis, added LIBOR fallback language to new loans, and overseen the transition to non-LIBOR based adjustable rate mortgages and floating rate commercial loans.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nFiscal and Monetary Policy changes may significantly impact our profitability and liquidity \n\n\nThe Company\u2019s business and earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Government and its agencies.\u00a0\u00a0The Bank is particularly affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States.\u00a0\u00a0Among the instruments of monetary policy available to the Federal Reserve are (a) conducting open market operations in U.S. government securities, (b) changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions, (c) imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions\u2019 deposits, and (d) imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates.\u00a0\u00a0These methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits.\u00a0\u00a0Changes to these policies of the Federal Reserve may have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n\nLegislation and regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry, including new interpretations, restrictions and requirements, could detrimentally affect the Company\u2019s business.\n\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, triggered sweeping reforms to the financial services industry.\u00a0\u00a0The Dodd-Frank Act, other consumer protection laws, and their implementing rules and regulations are likely to continue to result in increased compliance costs, along with possible restrictions on our products, services and manner of operations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\n\n\nThe CFPB has exercised its broad rule-making, supervisory, and examination authority of consumer financial products, as well as expanded data collection and enforcement powers, over depository institutions with more than $10.0\u00a0billion in assets.\u00a0\u00a0Staff changes to key positions within the CFPB by the Biden administration may result in the CFPB pursuing more strict enforcement policies, similar to that experienced under the Obama administration.\u00a0\u00a0Regulation of overall safety and soundness, the CRA, federal housing and flood insurance, as they pertain to consumer financial products and services, remains with the FRB.\u00a0\u00a0As a result of greater regulatory scrutiny of consumer financial products as a whole, the Company has become subject to more and expanded regulatory examinations, which also could result in increased costs as well as harm to our reputation in the event of a finding that we have not complied with the increased regulatory requirements.\n\n\nNew laws, regulations, and changes, and the uncertainty surrounding whether such laws, regulations and changes will be implemented, interpreted, repealed or reinstated, in the current regulatory and political climate, may continue to increase our costs of regulatory compliance.\u00a0\u00a0They may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our investments, and our ongoing operations, costs, and profitability.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBank of Hawaii and its nonbank subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal and applicable state regulation and supervision.  The bank regulatory scheme is primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds, and the banking system as a whole, not shareholders.  This regulatory framework affects our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, and growth, among other things.  Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations, and policies for possible changes, and proposed changes can be expected from the new federal administration that took office in January 2021.\u00a0\u00a0With Democratic control of the White House and both chambers of Congress there may be greater oversight of the banking industry.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFurther, leadership and staff changes in regulatory agencies such as the CFPB, CFTC, SEC, and the Treasury Department could lead to changes in the rulemaking, supervision, examination and enforcement priorities and policies of the agencies.  The potential impact of any changes within these agencies cannot be predicted at this time.\n\n\nChanges in the capital, leverage, liquidity requirements for financial institutions could materially affect future requirements of the Company.\n\n\nUnder Basel III, financial institutions are required to have more capital and a higher quality of capital.\u00a0\u00a0Under the final rules issued by the banking regulators, minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company.\n\n\nCompliance with Basel III resulted in increased capital, liquidity, and disclosure requirements.\u00a0\u00a0See the \u201cRegulatory Initiatives Affecting the Banking Industry\u201d section in MD&A for more information.\n\n\nChanges in income tax laws and interpretations, or in accounting standards, could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations.\n\n\nFurther changes in income tax laws could be enacted, or interpretations of existing income tax laws could change, causing an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we report our financial condition and results of operations.\u00a0\u00a0Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets, liabilities, and financial results.\u00a0\u00a0Periodically, new accounting standards are issued or existing standards are revised, changing the methods for preparing our financial statements.\u00a0\u00a0These changes are not within our control and may significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to Business Operations\n\n\nA failure in or breach of our operational systems, information systems, or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, may result in financial losses, loss of customers, or damage to our reputation.\n\n\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, we rely on third parties to provide key components of our infrastructure, including loan, deposit and general ledger processing, internet connections, and network access.\u00a0\u00a0These types of information and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, are critical to the operations of certain of our customers.\u00a0\u00a0These third parties with which we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing firms, financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations, could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, our communications and information systems and operations (including those of third parties that facilitate our business activities) could be damaged or interrupted due to events such as natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, operational failures, and similar events or disruptions.  Although we have safeguards and business continuity plans in place, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business and our customers, resulting in financial losses, loss of customers, or damage to our reputation.\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAn interruption or breach in security of our information systems or those related to merchants and third party vendors, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, or result in financial losses.\n\n\nOur business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of customer data, including payment card numbers and other personally identifiable information in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide data services.\u00a0\u00a0We also maintain important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about our employees and information relating to our operations.\u00a0\u00a0The integrity and protection of that customer and company data is important to us.\u00a0\u00a0As customer, public, legislative and regulatory expectations and requirements regarding operational and information security have increased, our operating systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns.\n\n\nOur technologies, systems, networks and software, and those of other financial institutions have been, and are likely to continue to be, the target of cybersecurity threats and attacks, which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures directed at us.\u00a0\u00a0These cybersecurity threats and attacks may include, but are not limited to, attempts to access information, including customer and company information, malicious code, computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events.\u00a0\u00a0These types of threats may result from human error, fraud or malice on the part of external or internal parties, intelligence-gathering by foreign governments, or from accidental technological failure internally or by our vendors.\u00a0\u00a0Further, to access our products and services our customers may use computers and mobile devices that are beyond our security control systems.\u00a0\u00a0The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions around the world have increased.\n\n\nOur customers and employees have been, and will continue to be, targeted by parties using fraudulent emails and other communications in attempts to misappropriate passwords, payment card numbers, bank account information or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware through \u201ctrojan horse\u201d programs to our customers\u2019 devices.\u00a0\u00a0These communications may appear to be legitimate messages sent by the Bank or other businesses, but direct recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the email or request that the recipient send a password or other confidential information via email or download a program.\u00a0\u00a0Despite our efforts to mitigate these threats through product improvements, use of encryption and authentication technology to secure online transmission of confidential consumer information, and customer and employee education, such attempted frauds against us or our merchants and our third party service providers remain a serious issue.\u00a0\u00a0The pervasiveness of cyber security incidents in general and the risks of cyber-crime are complex and continue to evolve.\u00a0\u00a0In light of several recent high-profile data breaches involving other companies\u2019 losses of customer personal and financial information, we believe this risk could cause customer and/or Bank losses, damage to our brand, and increase our costs through the ongoing cost of technology investments to improve security, as well as the potential financial and reputational impact of a cyber security incident involving the Company.\n\n\nAlthough we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information systems and have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.\u00a0\u00a0Even the most well-protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because attempted security breaches, particularly cyber-attacks and intrusions, or disruptions will occur in the future, and because the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected.\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus making it virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.\u00a0\u00a0A security breach or other significant disruption could: 1)\u00a0disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers; 2)\u00a0result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers, including account numbers and other financial information; 3)\u00a0result in a violation of applicable privacy, data breach and other laws, subjecting the Bank to additional regulatory scrutiny and exposing the Bank to civil litigation, governmental fines and possible financial liability; 4)\u00a0require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result; or 5)\u00a0harm our reputation or cause a decrease in the number of customers that choose to do business with us or reduce the level of business that our customers do with us.\u00a0\u00a0The occurrence of any such failures, disruptions or security breaches could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows as well as damage our brand and reputation.\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur mortgage banking income may experience significant volatility.\n\n\nOur mortgage banking income is highly influenced by the level and direction of mortgage interest rates, real estate activity, and refinancing activity.\u00a0\u00a0Interest rates can affect the amount of mortgage banking activity and impact fee income and the fair value of our derivative financial instruments and mortgage servicing rights.\u00a0\u00a0Mortgage banking income may also be impacted by changes in our strategy to manage our residential mortgage portfolio.\u00a0\u00a0For example, we may occasionally decide to add more conforming saleable loans to our portfolio (as opposed to selling the loans in the secondary market) which would reduce our gains on sales of residential mortgage loans.\u00a0\u00a0These variables could adversely affect mortgage banking income.\n\n\nOur mortgage loan servicing business may be impacted if we do not meet our obligations, or if servicing standards change.\n\n\nWe act as servicer for mortgage loans sold into the secondary market, primarily to government sponsored entities (\u201cGSEs\u201d) such as Fannie Mae.\u00a0\u00a0As a seller and servicer for those loans, we make warranties about their origination and are required to perform servicing according to complex contractual and handbook requirements.\u00a0\u00a0We maintain systems and procedures intended to ensure that we comply with these requirements.  We may be penalized and, in limited instances required to repurchase certain mortgages, due to alleged failures to adhere to these requirements.\u00a0\u00a0Should GSEs change the requirements in their servicing handbooks, we may sustain higher compliance costs.\n\n\nRisks related to representation and warranty provisions may impact our mortgage loan servicing business\n\n\nThe Company sells residential mortgage loans in the secondary market primarily to the Fannie Mae.\u00a0\u00a0The Company also pools FHA insured and VA guaranteed residential mortgage loans for sale to Ginnie Mae.\u00a0\u00a0These pools of FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed residential mortgage loans are securitized by Ginnie Mae.\u00a0\u00a0The agreements under which the Company sells residential mortgage loans to Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae and the insurance or guaranty agreements with FHA and VA contain provisions that include various representations and warranties regarding the origination and characteristics of the residential mortgage loans.\u00a0\u00a0Although the specific representations and warranties vary among investors, insurance or guarantee agreements, they typically cover ownership of the loan, validity of the lien securing the loan, the absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the property securing the loan, compliance with loan criteria set forth in the applicable agreement, compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws, and other matters.\u00a0\u00a0As of December\u00a031, 2021, the unpaid principal balance of residential mortgage loans sold by the Company was $2.3 billion.\u00a0\u00a0The agreements under which the Company sells residential mortgage loans require delivery of various documents to the investor or its document custodian.\u00a0\u00a0Although these loans are primarily sold on a non-recourse basis, the Company may be obligated to repurchase residential mortgage loans or reimburse investors for losses incurred if a loan review reveals that underwriting and documentation standards were potentially not met.\u00a0\u00a0Some agreements may require the Company to repurchase delinquent loans.\u00a0\u00a0Upon receipt of a repurchase request, the Company works with investors or insurers to arrive at a mutually agreeable resolution.\u00a0\u00a0Repurchase demands are typically reviewed on an individual loan by loan basis to validate the claims made by the investor or insurer and to determine if a contractually required repurchase event has occurred.\u00a0\u00a0The Company manages the risk associated with potential repurchases or other forms of settlement through its underwriting and quality assurance practices and by servicing mortgage loans to meet investor and secondary market standards.\u00a0\u00a0For the year ended December\u00a031, 2021, the Company repurchased seven residential mortgage loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance totaling $0.9 million as a result of the representation and warranty provisions contained in these contracts.\u00a0\u00a0The loans were delinquent as to principal and interest at the time of repurchase, however, no material losses were incurred related to these repurchases.\n\n\nRisks relating to residential mortgage loan servicing activities may adversely affect our results.\n\n\nIn addition to servicing loans in the Company\u2019s portfolio, substantially all of the loans the Company sells to investors are sold with servicing rights retained.\u00a0\u00a0The Company also services loans originated by other mortgage loan originators.\u00a0\u00a0As servicer, the Company\u2019s primary duties are to: (1)\u00a0collect payments due from borrowers; (2)\u00a0advance certain delinquent payments of principal and interest; (3)\u00a0maintain and administer any hazard, title, or primary mortgage insurance policies relating to the mortgage loans; (4)\u00a0maintain any required escrow accounts for payment of taxes and insurance and administer escrow payments; and (5)\u00a0foreclose on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent consistent with the documents governing a securitization, consider alternatives to foreclosure, such as loan modifications or short sales.\u00a0\u00a0Each agreement under which the Company acts as servicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for actions taken by the Company in such capacity and provides protection against expenses and liabilities incurred by the Company when acting in compliance with the respective servicing agreements.\u00a0\u00a0However, if the Company commits a material breach of obligations as servicer, the Company may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period following notice.\u00a0\u00a0The standards governing servicing and the possible remedies for violations of such standards vary by investor.\u00a0\u00a0These standards and remedies are determined by servicing guides issued by the investors as well as the contract provisions established between the investors and the Company.\u00a0\u00a0Remedies could include repurchase of an affected loan.\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nThe requirement to record certain assets and liabilities at fair value may adversely affect our financial results.\n\n\nWe report certain assets, including available-for-sale investment securities, at fair value.\u00a0\u00a0Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value we use quoted market prices or valuation models that utilize market data inputs to estimate fair value.\u00a0\u00a0Because we record these assets at their estimated fair value, we may incur losses even if the asset in question presents minimal credit risk.\u00a0\u00a0The level of interest rates can impact the estimated fair value of investment securities.\u00a0\u00a0Disruptions in the capital markets may require us to reserve for credit losses in future periods with respect to investment securities in our portfolio.\u00a0\u00a0The amount and timing of any credit allowance recognized will be measured as the difference between the security\u2019s amortized cost basis and the amount expected to be collected over the security\u2019s lifetime.\n\n\nNatural disasters and adverse weather could negatively affect real estate property values and bank operations.\n\n\nReal estate and real estate property values play an important role for the Bank in several ways.\u00a0\u00a0The Bank owns or leases many real estate properties in connection with its operations, primarily located in Hawaii with its unique weather and geology.\u00a0\u00a0Our business operations could suffer to the extent the Bank cannot utilize its branch network due to damage from weather or other natural disasters.\u00a0\u00a0Real estate is also utilized as collateral for many of our loans.\u00a0\u00a0A natural disaster in Hawaii or the Pacific Islands could cause property values in the affected areas to fall, which could require the Bank to record an impairment on its financial statements.\u00a0\u00a0A natural disaster could also impact borrowers\u2019 ability to pay their financial obligations, which would increase our exposure to loan defaults.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\n\nCompetition may adversely affect our business.\n\n\nOur future depends on our ability to compete effectively.\u00a0\u00a0We compete for deposits, loans, leases, and other financial services with a variety of competitors, including banks, thrifts, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage companies, finance companies, mutual funds, brokerage firms, insurance companies, and other non-traditional providers of financial services, including financial technology companies and financial service subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies.\u00a0\u00a0Some of our competitors are not subject to the same level of regulation and oversight that is required of banks and BHCs, and may benefit from tax exemptions or lower tax rates.\u00a0\u00a0As a result, some of these competitors may have lower cost structures.\n\n\nWe expect competitive conditions to intensify as consolidation in the financial services industry continues.\u00a0\u00a0The financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies, including non-depository institutions, to provide financial services.\u00a0\u00a0Also, some of our competitors, through delivery channels such as the Internet, may be based outside of the markets that we serve.\n\n\nBoth federal and local laws provide mechanisms for out-of-state banks and their holding companies to acquire or open branches in our service territories.\u00a0\u00a0Failure to effectively address this competitive risk by competing, innovating and making effective use of new and existing channels to deliver our products and services could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\n\n\nNegative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact our earnings and liquidity.\n\n\nReputational risk, or the risk to our business, earnings, liquidity, and capital from negative public opinion, could result from our actual or alleged conduct in a variety of areas, including legal and regulatory compliance, lending practices, corporate governance, litigation, ethical issues, or inadequate protection of customer information.\u00a0\u00a0We expend significant resources to comply with regulatory requirements.\u00a0\u00a0Failure to comply could result in reputational harm or significant legal or remedial costs.\u00a0\u00a0Damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract new customers, and adversely impact our earnings and liquidity.\n\n\nWe are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results.\n\n\nWe are, from time-to-time, involved in various legal proceedings arising from our normal business activities.\u00a0\u00a0These claims and legal actions, including supervisory actions by our regulators, could involve large monetary claims and significant defense costs.\u00a0\u00a0The outcome of these cases is uncertain.\u00a0\u00a0Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects.\u00a0\u00a0We may \n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nbe exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.\u00a0\u00a0Based on information currently available, we believe that the eventual outcome of known actions against us will not be materially in excess of such amounts accrued by us.\u00a0\u00a0However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of those matters may be material to our financial results for any particular period.\u00a0\u00a0See the \nContingencies\n section of Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\n\n\nOur performance depends on attracting and retaining key employees and skilled personnel to operate our business effectively.\n\n\nOur success is dependent on our ability to recruit qualified and skilled personnel to operate our business effectively.\u00a0\u00a0Competition for these qualified and skilled people is intense.\u00a0\u00a0There are a limited number of qualified personnel in the markets we serve, so our success depends in part on the continued services of many of our current management and other key employees.\u00a0\u00a0Failure to retain our key employees and maintain adequate staffing of qualified personnel could adversely impact our operations and our ability to compete.\n\n\nWe continue to experience higher turnover, consistent with others in the industry.\u00a0\u00a0That said, the financial industry has been more resilient with signs of leveling toward the end of 2021.\u00a0\u00a0Overall, sourcing and hiring of new employees has continued to keep pace with terminations.\u00a0\u00a0Employee retention efforts, to include a one-time inflation adjustment in conjunction with annual merit increases to help employees with the rapid rate of inflation, continue as well.\n\n\nThe soundness of other financial institutions may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\n\n\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions.\u00a0\u00a0Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, lending, counterparty, or other relationships.\u00a0\u00a0As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry in general have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions.\u00a0\u00a0We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual funds, and other institutional clients.\u00a0\u00a0Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us.\u00a0\u00a0Such losses could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "item7": ">Item\u00a07.\u00a0\u00a0Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n\nThe following MD&A is intended to help the reader understand the Company and its operations and is focused on our fiscal 2021 and 2020 financial results, including comparisons of year-to-year performance between these years.  Discussion and analysis of our 2019 fiscal year, as well as the year-to-year comparison between fiscal 2020 and 2019, are included \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December\u00a031, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2021.\n\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\u00a0\u00a0These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and may include statements concerning, among other things, the anticipated economic and business environment in our service area and elsewhere, credit quality and other financial and business matters in future periods, our future results of operations and financial position, our business strategy and plans and our objectives and future operations.\u00a0\u00a0We also may make forward-looking statements in our other documents filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d).\u00a0\u00a0In addition, our senior management may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others.\u00a0\u00a0Our forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions, any of which could prove to be inaccurate, and actual results may differ materially from those projected because of a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to: 1)\u00a0general economic conditions either nationally, internationally, or locally may be different than expected, and particularly, any event that negatively impacts the tourism industry in Hawaii; 2) the compounding effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced tourism in Hawaii, the duration and scope of government mandates or other limitations of or restrictions on travel, volatility in the international and national economy and credit markets, inflation, worker absenteeism, quarantines or other travel or health-related restrictions, the length and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the pace of recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic, and the effect of government, business and individual actions intended to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic; 3)\u00a0changes in market interest rates that may affect credit markets and our ability to maintain our net interest margin; 4)\u00a0changes in our credit quality or risk profile that may increase or decrease the required level of our reserve for credit losses; 5)\u00a0the impact of legislative and regulatory initiatives, particularly the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) and Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018; 6)\u00a0changes to the amount and timing of proposed common stock repurchases; 7)\u00a0unanticipated changes in the securities markets, public debt markets, and other capital markets in the U.S. and internationally, including, without limitation, the anticipated elimination of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a benchmark interest rate; 8)\u00a0changes in fiscal and monetary policies of the markets in which we operate; 9)\u00a0the increased cost of maintaining or the Company\u2019s ability to maintain adequate liquidity and capital, based on the requirements adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and U.S. regulators; 10)\u00a0changes in accounting standards; 11)\u00a0changes in tax laws or regulations, including Public Law 115-97, commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the interpretation of such laws and regulations; 12)\u00a0any failure in or breach of our operational systems, information systems or infrastructure, or those of our merchants, third party vendors and other service providers; 13) any interruption or breach of security of our information systems resulting in failures or disruptions in customer account management, general ledger processing, and loan or deposit systems; 14)\u00a0natural disasters, public unrest or adverse weather, public health, disease outbreaks, and other conditions impacting us and our customers\u2019 operations or negatively impacting the tourism industry in Hawaii; 15) competitive pressures in the markets for financial services and products; 16)\u00a0actual or alleged conduct which could harm our reputation; and 17)\u00a0the impact of litigation and regulatory investigations of the Company, including costs, expenses, settlements, and judgments.  Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement as a prediction of our actual results.\u00a0\u00a0A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included under the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part\u00a0I of this report.\u00a0\u00a0Words such as \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201ctargeted,\u201d and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements.\u00a0\u00a0We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect later events or circumstances, except as may be required by law.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor the reasons described above, we caution you against relying on any forward-looking statements.  You should not consider any list of such factors to be an exhaustive statement of all of the risks, uncertainties, or potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause our current expectations or beliefs to change.  Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as otherwise may be required by the federal securities laws.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and follow general practices within the industries in which we operate.\u00a0\u00a0The most significant accounting policies we follow are presented in Note\u00a01 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\u00a0\u00a0Application of these principles requires us to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes.\u00a0\u00a0Most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies.\u00a0\u00a0Several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\u00a0\u00a0These factors include among other things, whether the policy requires management to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.\u00a0\u00a0The accounting policies which we believe to be most critical in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are related to the determination of the reserve for credit losses, fair value estimates, leased asset residual values, and income taxes.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nReserve for Credit Losses\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA consequence of lending activities is that we may incur credit losses.\u00a0\u00a0The amount of such losses will vary depending upon the risk characteristics of the loan and lease portfolio as affected by economic conditions such as rising interest rates and the financial performance of borrowers.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe reserve for credit losses consists of the allowance for credit losses (the \u201cAllowance\u201d) and the reserve for unfunded commitments (the \u201cUnfunded Reserve\u201d).  The reserve for credit losses also included a reserve for accrued interest receivable related to loans in which interest payment forbearances were granted to borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0\u00a0As a result of our January 1, 2020, adoption of ASU No. 2016-13, \n\u201cMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d\n and its related amendments, our methodology for estimating the reserve for credit losses changed significantly from December\u00a031, 2019.\u00a0\u00a0The standard replaced the \u201cincurred loss\u201d approach with an \u201cexpected loss\u201d approach known as current expected credit loss (\u201cCECL\u201d).\u00a0\u00a0The CECL approach requires an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure (or pool of exposures).\u00a0\u00a0It removes the incurred loss approach\u2019s threshold that delayed the recognition of a credit loss until it was \u201cprobable\u201d a loss event was \u201cincurred.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe estimate of expected credit losses under the CECL approach is based on relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts.\u00a0\u00a0Historical loss experience is generally the starting point for estimating expected credit losses.\u00a0\u00a0We then consider whether the historical loss experience should be adjusted for asset-specific risk characteristics or current conditions at the reporting date that did not exist over the period from which historical experience was used.\u00a0\u00a0Finally, we consider forecasts about future economic conditions that are reasonable and supportable.\u00a0\u00a0The Unfunded Reserve represents the expected credit losses on off-balance sheet commitments such as unfunded commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.\u00a0\u00a0The Unfunded Reserve is determined by estimating future draws and applying the expected loss rates on those draws.  However, a liability is not recognized for commitments unconditionally cancellable by the Company.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManagement\u2019s evaluation of the appropriateness of the reserve for credit losses is often the most critical of accounting estimates for a financial institution.\u00a0\u00a0Our determination of the amount of the reserve for credit losses requires significant reliance on the credit risk rating we assign to individual borrowers, the use of estimates and significant judgment as to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on criticized loans, significant reliance on historical loss rates on homogenous portfolios, consideration of our quantitative and qualitative evaluation of economic factors, and the reliance on our reasonable and supportable forecasts.\u00a0\u00a0While our methodology in establishing the reserve for credit losses attributes portions of the Allowance and Unfunded Reserve to the commercial and consumer portfolio segments, the entire Allowance and Unfunded Reserve is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan and lease portfolio and total amount of unfunded credit commitments, respectively.\u00a0\u00a0The provision for credit losses reflects our internal calculation and judgment of the appropriate amount of the reserve for credit losses.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe reserve for credit losses related to our commercial portfolio segment is generally most sensitive to the credit risk rating assigned to each borrower.\u00a0\u00a0Commercial loan risk ratings are evaluated based on each situation by experienced senior credit officers and are subject to periodic review by an independent internal team of credit specialists.\u00a0\u00a0The reserve for credit losses related to our consumer portfolio segment is generally most sensitive to economic assumptions and delinquency trends.\u00a0\u00a0The reserve for credit losses attributable to each portfolio segment also includes an amount for inherent risks not reflected in the historical analyses.\u00a0\u00a0Relevant factors include, but are not limited to, concentrations of credit risk (geographic, large borrower, and industry), economic trends and conditions, changes in underwriting standards, experience and depth of lending staff, trends in delinquencies, and the level of criticized loans.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe impact of utilizing the CECL approach to calculate the reserve for credit losses is significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of our loan portfolio, as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecasts utilized.\u00a0\u00a0Material changes to these and other relevant factors may result in greater volatility to the reserve for credit losses, and therefore, greater volatility to our reported earnings.\u00a0\u00a0See Notes 1 and\u00a04 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the \u201cCorporate Risk Profile\u00a0- Credit Risk\u201d section in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d) for more information on the Allowance and the Unfunded Reserve.\n\n\nFair Value Measurements\n\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\u00a0\u00a0The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market inputs.\u00a0\u00a0For financial instruments that are traded actively and have quoted market prices or observable market inputs, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value.\u00a0\u00a0However, when quoted market prices or observable market inputs are not fully available, significant management judgment may be necessary to estimate fair value.\u00a0\u00a0In developing our fair value measurements, we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\n\n\nThe fair value hierarchy defines Level\u00a01 valuations as those based on quoted prices, unadjusted, for identical instruments traded in active markets.\u00a0\u00a0Level 2 valuations are those based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, or model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market.\u00a0\u00a0Level\u00a03 valuations are based on model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market, or significant management judgment or estimation, some of which may be internally developed.\n\n\nFinancial assets that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include available-for-sale investment securities, loans held for sale, mortgage servicing rights, investments related to deferred compensation arrangements, and derivative financial instruments.\u00a0\u00a0As of December\u00a031, 2021, and December\u00a031, 2020, $4.0 billion or 20% and $2.7 billion or 15%, respectively, of our total assets consisted of financial assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and most of these financial assets consisted of available-for-sale investment securities measured using information from a third party pricing

pricing service makes no representations or warranties that the pricing data provided to us is complete or free from errors, omissions, or defects.\u00a0\u00a0As a result, we have processes in place to monitor and periodically review the information provided to us by our third party pricing service such as: 1)\u00a0Our third party pricing service provides us with documentation by asset class of inputs and methodologies used to value securities.\u00a0\u00a0We review this documentation to evaluate the inputs and valuation methodologies used to place securities into the appropriate level of the fair value hierarchy.\u00a0\u00a0This documentation is periodically updated by our third party pricing service.\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, transfers of securities within the fair value hierarchy are made if deemed necessary.\u00a0\u00a02)\u00a0On a quarterly basis, management also selects a sample of securities priced by the Company\u2019s third party pricing service and reviews the significant assumptions and valuation methodologies used by the pricing service with respect to those securities.\u00a0\u00a0The information provided is comprised of market reference data, which may include reported trades; bids, offers, or broker-dealer dealer quotes; benchmark yields and spreads; as well as other reference data as appropriate.  Periodically, based on these reviews, management determines whether the current placement of the security in the fair value hierarchy is appropriate or whether transfers may be warranted.\u00a0\u00a03)\u00a0On a quarterly basis, management reviews the pricing information received from our third party pricing service.\u00a0\u00a0This review process includes a comparison to a second source.\u00a0\u00a04)\u00a0Our third party pricing service has also established processes for us to submit inquiries regarding quoted prices.\u00a0\u00a0Periodically, we will challenge the quoted prices provided by our third party pricing service.\u00a0\u00a0Our third party pricing service will review the inputs to the evaluation in light of the new market data presented by us.\u00a0\u00a0Our third party pricing service may then affirm the original quoted price or may update the evaluation on a going forward basis.\u00a0\u00a0Generally, we do not adjust the price from the third party service provider.\u00a0\u00a05)\u00a0On an annual basis, we obtain and review the third party\u2019s most recently issued Service Organization Controls report related to controls placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness, to update our understanding of the third party pricing service\u2019s control environment.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nSee Note\u00a021 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our fair value measurements.\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIncome Taxes\n\n\nWe determine our liabilities for income taxes based on current tax regulations and interpretations in tax jurisdictions where our income is subject to taxation.\u00a0\u00a0Currently, we file tax returns for federal, six state and local domestic jurisdictions, and three foreign jurisdictions.\u00a0\u00a0In estimating income taxes payable or receivable, we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance in the context of each tax position.\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, previously estimated liabilities are regularly reevaluated and adjusted through the provision for income taxes.\u00a0\u00a0Changes in the estimate of income taxes payable or receivable occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax law, the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities, and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that impact the relative merits and risks of each tax position.\u00a0\u00a0These changes, when they occur, may affect the provision for income taxes as well as current and deferred income taxes, and may be significant to our statements of income and condition.\n\n\nManagement's determination of the realization of net deferred tax assets is based upon management's judgment of various future events and uncertainties, including the timing, character and amount of future income, as well as the implementation of various tax planning strategies to maximize realization of the deferred tax assets.\u00a0\u00a0A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\u00a0\u00a0As of December\u00a031, 2021, and December\u00a031, 2020, we carried a valuation allowance of $3.2 million and $3.6 million, respectively, related to our deferred tax assets established in connection with our low-income housing investments.\n\n\nWe are also required to record a liability, referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit (\"UTB\"), for the entire amount of benefit taken in a prior or future income tax return when we determine that a tax position has a less than 50% likelihood of being accepted by the taxing authority.\u00a0\u00a0As of December\u00a031, 2021, and December\u00a031, 2020, our liabilities for UTBs were $4.0 million and $5.4 million, respectively. \n\n\nIn 2021, the Company recognized federal and State of Hawaii investment tax credits from energy investments.\u00a0\u00a0The Company uses the deferral method of accounting for its investment tax credit with the benefit recognized in the provision for income taxes.\u00a0\u00a0These credits reduced the Company's provision for income taxes by $2.1 million, $3.1 million, and $4.1 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nWe are a regional financial services company serving businesses, consumers, and governments in Hawaii, Guam, and other Pacific Islands.\u00a0\u00a0Our principal operating subsidiary, the Bank, was founded in 1897.\n\n\nOur business strategy is to use our unique market knowledge, prudent management discipline and brand strength to deliver exceptional value to our stakeholders.\u00a0\u00a0Our business plan is balanced between growth and risk management while maintaining flexibility to adjust to economic changes.\u00a0\u00a0We will\u00a0continue to focus on providing customers with best-in-class service and an innovative mix of products and services.\u00a0 We will also remain\u00a0focused on continuing to deliver\u00a0strong financial results\u00a0while maintaining\u00a0prudent risk and capital management strategies as well as our commitment to\u00a0support our local communities.\n\n\nHawaii Economy\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had and is continuing to have an impact on the Hawaii economy.\u00a0\u00a0Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, at risk industries of leisure and hospitality represented 19% of jobs and 10% of Hawaii\u2019s GDP.\u00a0\u00a0Hawaii benefits from a wide range of industries that help to provide stability in the case of economic shocks.\u00a0\u00a0Federal government jobs, primarily military, have historically been a stabilizing part of Hawaii\u2019s economy, supplying about 20% of GDP.\u00a0\u00a0Construction activity, including the Honolulu Rail Project, and other non-visitor-related activities have continued despite the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0\u00a0Hawaii\u2019s large retiree population also contributes to a stable economic base.\u00a0\u00a0Hawaii\u2019s unemployment rate was 5.7% in December 2021, while still above the pre-pandemic level, it has fallen substantially since its peak in April and May of 2020.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe volume of single-family home sales on Oahu increased 17.9% in 2021 compared to 2020, while the volume of condominium sales on Oahu increased 53.1% in 2021 compared to 2020.  The median price of single-family home sales on Oahu increased by 19.3% in 2021 compared to 2020, while the condominium sales price on Oahu increased by 9.2% in 2021 compared to 2020.  As of December 31, 2021, months of inventory of single-family homes and condominiums on Oahu was 0.8 months and 1.6 months, respectively.\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEarnings Summary\n\n\nNet income for 2021 was $253.3 million, an increase of $99.6 million or 65% compared to 2020.\u00a0\u00a0Diluted earnings per common share were $6.25 in 2021, an increase of $2.39 or 62% compared to 2020.\u00a0\u00a0Our return on average assets was 1.14% in 2021, an increase of 35 basis points from 2020, and our return on average shareholders\u2019 equity was 16.94% in 2021, compared to 11.38% in 2020.\n\n\nOur higher net income in 2021 was primarily due to the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 \n\n\n\n\nThe provision for credit losses in 2021 was a net benefit of $50.5 million compared to a net expense of $117.8 million in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 \n\n\n\n\nNet occupancy expense was $26.2 million in 2021, a decrease of $13.3 million or 34% compared to 2020.\u00a0\u00a0This decrease was \nprimarily due $9.5 million gain on sales of real estate property on the island of Oahu and Guam, and an impairment charge related to the closures of 12 branches and write down of cash-only ATMs in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 \n\n\n\n\nFees, exchange, and other service charges was $55.5 million in 2021, an increase of $8.4 million or 18% compared to 2020.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis increase was primarily due to higher fees from ATMs, merchant income, and debit and credit card transaction volume.\n\n\nThese items were partially offset by the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 \n\n\n\n\nThe provision for income taxes was $72.2 million in 2021, an increase of $36.9 million or 104% compared to 2020.\u00a0\u00a0The effective tax rate was 22.17% in 2021 compared to 18.68% in 2020.\u00a0\u00a0This increase was primarily due to a higher pretax income.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 \n\n\n\n\nSalaries and benefits expense was $228.3 million in 2021, an increase of $21.0 million or 10% compared to 2020.\u00a0\u00a0This increase was primarily due to \na $13.6 million increase in incentive compensation coupled with a $5.7 million increase in share-based compensation due to a higher number of restricted stock units being amortized.\u00a0\u00a0These increases were partially offset by a $3.0 million decrease in separation expense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 \n\n\n\n\nNet losses on sales of investment securities was $1.3 million in 2021, a decrease of $11.2 million compared to 2020.\u00a0\u00a0This decrease was primarily due to gains on sale of 80,214 Visa Class B Shares during the second quarter of 2020.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 \n\n\n\n\nOther noninterest expense was $63.6 million in 2021, an increase of $8.6 million or 16% compared to 2020.\u00a0\u00a0These increase was \nprimarily due to a total of $7.0 million early termination costs incurred in 2021 related to the prepayment of $150.0 million of repurchase agreements and $50.0 million of FHLB advances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 \n\n\n\n\nMortgage banking income was $15.0 million in 2021, a decrease of $2.9 million or 16% compared to 2020.\u00a0\u00a0This decrease was primarily due to decreased sales and margins on sales of conforming saleable loans from current production.\u00a0\u00a0This decrease was offset by valuation allowance recovery to our mortgage serving rights. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 \n\n\n\n\nOther noninterest income was $19.6 million in 2021, a decrease of $10.8 million or 36% compared to 2020.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis decrease was primarily due to a $9.3 million decrease in fees related to our customer interest rate swap derivatives. \n\n\nWe maintained a strong balance sheet throughout 2021, with what we believe are adequate reserves for credit losses, and high levels of liquidity and capital.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 \n\n\n\n\nTotal assets were $22.8 billion as of December\u00a031, 2021, an increase of $2.2 billion or 11% from December\u00a031, 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 \n\n\n\n\nTotal loans and leases were $12.3 billion as of December\u00a031, 2021, an increase of $0.3 billion or 3% from December\u00a031, 2020, primarily due to growth in our consumer portfolio, partially offset by a decrease of $0.4 billion in PPP loans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 \n\n\n\n\nThe allowance for credit losses (the \u201cAllowance\u201d) was $157.8 million as of December\u00a031, 2021, a decrease of $58.4 million or 27% from December\u00a031, 2020.\u00a0\u00a0The

spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities.  Net interest margin is defined as net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, as a percentage of average earning assets.  We experienced lower yields in both our investment securities portfolio and loan portfolio, which were partially offset by lower rates paid on our interest-bearing deposits, a reflection of the lower rate environment.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nYields on our earning assets decreased by 50 basis points in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the lower rate environment.  Yields on our commercial and industrial loans increased by 31 points primarily due to accelerated fees as a result of PPP loans forgiveness.\u00a0\u00a0Yields on our commercial mortgage decreased by 46 basis points due to lower yields on floating rate loans, and new loans with lower rates than loans that were paid off.\u00a0\u00a0Yields on our construction loans decreased by 42 basis points due to lower yields on floating-rate loans, and new loans with lower rates in comparison to loans that were paid off or transferred to commercial mortgage upon completion.\u00a0\u00a0Yields on our commercial lease financing increased by 230 basis points primarily due to no leveraged lease residual impairment in 2021 compare to $3.0 million impairment in the residual value of a leveraged lease in 2020.\u00a0\u00a0Yields on our funds sold decreased by 8 basis points primarily due to federal fund rate decreases.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, yields on our investment securities portfolio decreased by 54 basis points primarily due to purchases of lower yielding securities in the current lower rate environment.\n\n\n27\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInterest rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities decreased 19 basis points in 2021 compared to 2020.  Decreases to our funding costs were primarily due to lower rates paid on our interest-bearing deposits.  Interest rates paid on our securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased by 9 basis points from 2020.  In 2021, we terminated four of our repurchase agreements and partially terminated one, with an aggregate total of $150.0 million, with three private institution.  These repurchase agreements had a weighted-average interest rate of 2.0% and were scheduled to mature in 2022, 2024, 2025, and 2026. \n\n\nAverage balances of our earning assets increased by $2.8 billion or 16% in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to growth in our deposits.  In particular, the average balances of our investment securities increased by $2.1 billion.  The average balance of total loan and leases increased by $431.6 million.\u00a0\u00a0The average balance of funds sold increased by $258.3 million.  The average balance of our commercial and industrial portfolio including PPP loans decreased by $58.5 million in 2021 compared to the same period in 2020.  This decrease was primarily due to higher payoff activities, partially offset by an increase of PPP loans.  The increase in PPP loans was due to origination of new loans under the PPP in 2021.  The average balance of our commercial mortgage portfolio increased by $273.9 million as a result of continued demand from new and existing customers.  The average balance of our residential mortgage portfolio increased by $253.7 million primarily due to higher loan originations partially offset by an increase in payoff activity.\u00a0\u00a0The average balance of our automobile loans portfolio increased by $7.9 million primarily due to competitive loan programs and pricing.  The average balance of our home equity portfolio decreased by $5.6 million as a result of a slight increase in payoff levels.\n\n\nAverage balances of our interest-bearing liabilities increased by $1.3 billion or 10% in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to growth in our demand and savings deposits which increased by $1.1 billion and $719.2 million, respectively.  Average balances in other debt decreased by $34.4 million primarily due to the prepayment of FHLB advances totaling $50.0 million in the second quarter of 2021.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNoninterest Income\n\n\nTable\u00a03 presents the major components of noninterest income for 2021 and 2020.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoninterest Income\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable 3\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nYear\u00a0Ended\u00a0December\u00a031,\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nDollar\n\n\nChange\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPercent\n\n\nChange\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(dollars in thousands)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2021 to 2020\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrust and Asset Management\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n46,068\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n43,456\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n2,612\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMortgage Banking\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n14,964\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n17,871\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(2,907\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(16\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService Charges on Deposit Accounts\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n25,564\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n24,910\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n654\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFees, Exchange, and Other Service Charges\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n55,457\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n47,056\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n8,401\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestment Securities Gains (Losses), Net\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(1,297\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n9,932\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(11,229\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nn.m.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnuity and Insurance\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3,224\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3,362\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(138\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(4\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBank-Owned Life Insurance\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n7,784\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n7,388\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n396\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n19,589\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n30,434\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(10,845\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(36\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Noninterest Income\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n171,353\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n184,409\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n(13,056\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(7\n\n\n\n\n)%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn.m.- not meaningful.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTrust and asset management income is comprised of fees earned from the management and administration of trusts and other customer assets.\u00a0\u00a0These fees are largely based upon the market value of the assets that the Bank manages and the fee rate charged to customers.\u00a0\u00a0Total trust assets under administration were $11.5 billion and $10.5 billion as of December\u00a031, 2021, and December\u00a031, 2020, respectively.\u00a0\u00a0Trust and asset management income increased by $2.6 million or 6% in 2021 compared to 2020 due to increases in trust assets under administration and tax service fees.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMortgage banking income is highly influenced by mortgage interest rates, the housing market, the amount of our loan sales, and our valuation of mortgage servicing rights.\u00a0 Mortgage banking income decreased by $2.9 million or 16% in 2021 compared to 2020.\u00a0\u00a0The decrease in 2021 was primarily due to decreased sales of conforming saleable loans from current production, which was partially offset by a valuation allowance recovery to our mortgage servicing rights.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nService charges on deposit accounts increased by $0.7 million or 3% in 2021 compared to 2020.\u00a0\u00a0This increase was primarily due to an increase in account analysis fees.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n28\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFees, exchange, and other service charges are primarily comprised of debit and credit card income, fees from ATMs, merchant service activity, and other loan fees and special charges.

million increase in incentive compensation coupled with a $5.7 million increase in shared-based compensation due to a higher number of restricted stock units being amortized, which was partially offset by forfeiture of unvested restricted stock grants.\u00a0\u00a0These increases were partially offset by a $3.0 million decrease in separation expense. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nNet occupancy expense decreased by $13.3 million or 34% in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to $9.4 million net gain on sales of real estate property on the island of Oahu and Guam, coupled with a decrease in repairs and maintenance in 2021, and an impairment charge related to the closures of 12 branches recorded in 2020.\n\n\nNet equipment expense increased by $0.3 million or 1% in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in software license fees and maintenance.\n\n\nData processing expense increased by $1.8 million or 10% in 2021 compared to 2020 due to ongoing information technology projects coupled with the rollout of contactless debit cards in 2021.\n\n\nProfessional fees expense increased by $0.7 million or 6% in 2021 compared to 2020 due to an increase in professional services primarily in human resources and executive administration.\n\n\nFDIC insurance increased by $0.8 million or 13% in 2021 compared to 2020 due to an increase in average total assets.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTotal other expense increased by $8.6 million or 16% in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to $7.0 million early termination costs incurred in 2021 related to the prepayment

provision for income taxes was $72.2 million in 2021, an increase of $36.9 million compared to 2020.\u00a0\u00a0The higher effective tax rate in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to higher pretax income and fewer energy tax credits.  The effective tax rate in 2021 was also negatively impacted by an increase in the disallowance of the compensation deduction under Sec.162 (m).  The nondeductible compensation in 2021 was larger than 2020, due to changes in tax law under the Tax Cut and Jobs Act that became effective in 2021.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAnalysis of Business Segments\n\n\nOur business segments are Consumer Banking, Commercial Banking, and Treasury and Other.\u00a0\u00a0Table\u00a06 summarizes net income from our business segments for 2021 and 2020.\u00a0\u00a0Additional information about segment performance is presented in Note\u00a013 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness Segment Net Income\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable 6\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(dollars in thousands)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsumer Banking\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n79,385\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n92,370\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommercial Banking\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n121,305\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n120,722\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n200,690\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n213,092\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreasury and Other\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n52,682\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(59,288\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsolidated Total\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n253,372\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n153,804\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nConsumer Banking\n\n\nNet income decreased by $13.0 million or 14% in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in noninterest expense and a decrease in net interest income.  This was partly offset by an increase in noninterest income and a decrease in the provision for credit losses.  The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to increases in allocated expense, partly offset by a decrease in net occupancy expense, which was primarily due to $3.1 million net gain on sales of real estate property on the island of Oahu, and an impairment charge related to the closures of 12 branches recorded in 2020.  The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to lower average rates in the segment\u2019s deposit portfolio, partly offset by higher average balances in the deposit portfolio, as well as higher average rates and higher average balances in the segment\u2019s loan portfolio.  The increase in noninterest income was primarily due to increases in trust and asset management fees and debit card income, partly offset by a decrease in mortgage banking income.  The decrease in the provision for credit losses was primarily due to lower net charge-offs in our automobile, residential mortgage, and installment loan portfolios.\n\n\nCommercial Banking\n\n\nNet income increased by $0.6 million or 0.5% in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in net interest income, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest income and an increase in noninterest expense.\u00a0\u00a0The increase in net interest income was primarily due to growth in the segment\u2019s loan portfolios and a reduction in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower average rates on deposits.  Loan growth was primarily driven by increases in the commercial mortgage and construction portfolios.  Deposit growth was primarily driven by increases in demand and savings deposits, partially offset by a decrease in time deposits.\u00a0\u00a0The decrease in noninterest income is primarily due to a decrease in customer derivative program revenue, partially offset by increased in loan fees, service charges on deposit accounts, and merchant income.  The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to higher salaries and benefits expenses and merchant transaction and processing fees, partially offset by lower allocated expenses from support units.\n\n\nTreasury and Other\n\n\nNet income increased by $112.0 million in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to a decrease in provision for credit losses, partially offset by an increase in provision for income taxes and a decrease in noninterest income.\u00a0\u00a0The decrease in provision for credit losses was primarily due to management\u2019s best estimate of losses over the life of loans and leases in our portfolio in accordance with the CECL approach, given the economic outlook, consumer delinquency rates, post deferral consumer payment trends, low commercial delinquency rates post-deferral, strong commercial performance and liquidity levels, and forecasts for COVID-19 pandemic driven market changes, as well as the cumulative impact of the intervention of fiscal, monetary and regulatory programs.\u00a0\u00a0The provision for income taxes in this business segment represents the residual amount to arrive at the total tax expense for the Company.  The decrease in noninterest income was due to the sale of Visa Class B Shares during the second quarter of 2020.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\nTable of

reflect weighted average life, including anticipated future prepayments.\n\n\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, our investment securities portfolio was comprised of securities with an average base duration of approximately 4.43 years.\n\n\nWe continually evaluate our investment securities portfolio in response to established asset/liability management objectives, changing market conditions that could affect profitability, and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed.\u00a0\u00a0These evaluations may cause us to change the level of funds we deploy into investment securities, change the composition of our investment securities portfolio, and change the proportion of investments made into the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment categories.\n\n\nMortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac continue to be the largest concentrations in our portfolio.  As of December\u00a031, 2021, these mortgage-backed securities were all AAA-rated, with a low probability of a change in their credit ratings in the near future.\u00a0\u00a0As of December\u00a031, 2021, our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio was comprised of securities with an average base duration of approximately 4.15 years.\n\n\nGross unrealized gains in our investment securities portfolio were $49.8 million as of December\u00a031, 2021, and $158.9 million as of December\u00a031, 2020.\u00a0\u00a0Gross unrealized losses on our temporarily impaired investment securities were $142.8 million as of December\u00a031, 2021, and $2.9 million as of December\u00a031, 2020.\u00a0\u00a0The overall increase in net unrealized losses was primarily due to the increase in interest rates during 2021. \n\n\n32\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe gross unrealized loss positions were primarily related to mortgage-backed securities issued by \nU.S. government agencies \nand\n U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. \n \nThese securities carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government, are widely recognized as \u201crisk free,\u201d and have a long history of zero credit loss. \n \nTotal gross unrealized losses were primarily attributable to changes in interest rates, relative to when the investment securities were purchased, and not due to the credit quality of the investment securities. \n \nWe do not intend to sell the investment securities that were in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investment securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity.\n\n\nSee Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s corporate bond holdings as of December\u00a031, 2021, had a fair value of $403.3 million.\u00a0\u00a0Of this total, $24.7 million or 6% was fully guaranteed by the Export-Import Bank of the United States, an agency of the U.S. government, and $11.0 million was fully guaranteed by the U.S. government acting through the U.S. Agency for International Development.\u00a0\u00a0Of the remaining $367.5 million of corporate bonds, all were credit-rated A- or better by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization.\n\n\nLoans and

December\u00a031, 2020, primarily due to growth in our consumer loan and lease portfolio.\n\n\n33\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe commercial loan and lease portfolio is comprised of commercial and industrial loans,\n PPP loans,\n commercial mortgages, construction loans, and lease financing.\u00a0\u00a0Commercial and industrial loans are made primarily to corporations, middle market, and small businesses for the purpose of financing equipment acquisition, expansion, working capital, and other general business purposes.\u00a0\u00a0\nPPP loans were made to small businesses who were affected by economic conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic to provide cash flow assistance to employers.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nCommercial mortgages and construction loans are offered to real estate investors, developers, and builders primarily domiciled in Hawaii.\u00a0\u00a0Commercial mortgages are secured by first mortgages on commercial real estate at loan-to-value ratios generally not \nexceeding 75%.\u00a0\u00a0The\n commercial properties are predominantly developments such as retail centers, apartments, industrial properties, and to a lesser extent, specialized properties such as hotels.\u00a0\u00a0The primary source of repayment for investor property is cash flow from the property and for owner-occupied property is the operating cash flow from the business.\u00a0\u00a0Construction loans are \nmade \nfor the purchase or construction of a property for which repayment will be generated by the property.\u00a0\u00a0We classify loans as construction until the completion of the construction phase.\u00a0\u00a0Following construction, if a loan is retained, the loan is reclassified to the commercial mortgage category.\u00a0\u00a0Lease financing consists of sales-type leases and leveraged leases and are used by commercial customers to finance capital purchases.\u00a0\u00a0Although our primary market is Hawaii, the commercial portfolio contains loans to some borrowers based on the U.S. Mainland, including some Shared National Credits.\n\n\nCommercial loans and leases were $5.0 billion as of December\u00a031, 2021, a decrease of $134.5 million or 3% from December\u00a031, 2020.\u00a0\u00a0Commercial and industrial loans remained relatively unchanged from December\u00a031, 2020.\u00a0 PPP loans decreased by $390.9 million or 76% from December\u00a031, 2020, primarily due to forgiveness payments received from SBA.\u00a0\u00a0Commercial mortgage loans increased by $297.3 million or 10% from December\u00a031, 2020, primarily due to continued demand from new and existing customers.\u00a0\u00a0Construction loans decreased by $39.5 million or 15% from December\u00a031, 2020, primarily due to paydowns and successful completion of construction projects such as condominiums and low-income housing, partially offset by increased activity in our portfolio.  Lease financing decreased by $5.7 million\u00a0or 5% from December\u00a031, 2020, primarily due to paydowns.\n\n\nThe consumer loan and lease portfolio is comprised of residential mortgage loans, home equity lines and loans, indirect auto loans and leases, and other consumer loans including personal credit lines and direct installment loans.\u00a0\u00a0These products are generally offered in the geographic markets we serve.\u00a0\u00a0Although we offer a variety of products, our residential mortgage loan portfolio is primarily comprised of fixed-rate loans concentrated in Hawaii.\u00a0\u00a0We also offer a variety of home equity lines and loans, usually secured by first mortgages on residential property of the borrower.\u00a0\u00a0Automobile lending activities include loans and leases secured by new or used automobiles.\u00a0\u00a0We originate automobile loans and leases on an indirect basis through selected dealerships.\u00a0\u00a0Direct installment loans are generally unsecured and are often used for personal expenses or for debt consolidation.\n\n\nConsumer loans and leases were $7.3 billion as of December\u00a031, 2021, an increase of $453.6 million or 7% from December\u00a031, 2020.\u00a0\u00a0Residential mortgage loans increased by $179.1 million or 4% from December\u00a031, 2020, primarily due to continued high origination volume in all channels (retail, wholesale, and direct to consumer).  Home equity increased by $232.1 million or 14% from December\u00a031, 2020, as a result of strong increase in new originations, solid facility utilization rates and stable payoff levels.\u00a0\u00a0Automobile loans increased by $27.8 million or 4% from December\u00a031, 2020, primarily driven by competitive loan programs and strong consumer demand.\u00a0\u00a0Other consumer loans increased by $14.6 million or 4% from December\u00a031, 2020, primarily due to growth in our installment loans.\n\n\nSee Note\u00a04 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the

repurchase agreements with government entities and 3.0 years for our repurchase agreements with private institutions.\u00a0\u00a0Some of our repurchase agreements with private institutions may be terminated at earlier specified dates by the private institution or in some cases by either the private institution or the Company.\u00a0\u00a0If all such agreements were to terminate at the earliest possible date, the weighted-average maturity for our repurchase agreements with private institutions would be 2.8 years.\u00a0 As of December\u00a031, 2021, and December\u00a031, 2020, the weighted-average interest rate for repurchase agreements with government entities were 1.55% and 1.49%, respectively, while the weighted-average interest rate for repurchase agreements with private institutions as of December\u00a031, 2021, and December\u00a031, 2020, were 2.46% and 2.39%, respectively, with all rates being fixed.\u00a0\u00a0Each of our repurchase agreements is accounted for as collateralized financing arrangement (i.e., secured borrowing) and not as a sale and subsequent repurchase of securities.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn 2021, we terminated four and partially terminated one of our repurchase agreements, with an aggregate total of $150.0 million, with three private institutions.\u00a0\u00a0These repurchase agreements had a weighted-average interest rate of 2.0% and were scheduled to mature in 2022, 2024, 2025, and 2026.  \n\n\nOther Debt\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOther debt was $10.4 million as of December\u00a031, 2021, a decrease of $50.1 million or 83% from December\u00a031, 2020.\u00a0\u00a0During the second quarter of 2021, we prepaid the FHLB advances totaling $50.0 million with a weighted-average interest rate of 1.19% and maturity dates in May 2024.\u00a0\u00a0As of December\u00a031, 2021, our available capacity under our line of credit with the FHLB was $3.0 billion.\n\n\nPension and Postretirement Plan Obligations\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRetirement benefits payable were $38.5 million as of December\u00a031, 2021, a $12.7 million or 25% decrease from December\u00a031, 2020.\u00a0\u00a0Our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost are actuarially determined based on a number of key assumptions, including the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets, and the health-care cost trend rate.\u00a0\u00a0The accounting for pension and postretirement benefit plans reflect the long-term nature of the obligations and the investment horizon of the plan assets.\u00a0\u00a0The decrease in retirement benefits payable was primarily due to the change in discount rate, partially offset by an increase in the plan assets.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit cost.\u00a0\u00a0The discount rate used to value the present value of future benefit obligations as of each year-end is the rate used to estimate the net periodic benefit cost for the following year.\u00a0\u00a0Table\u00a015 presents a sensitivity analysis of a 25 basis point change in discount rates

Obligations\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company has various contractual obligations that affect its cash flows and liquidity.\u00a0\u00a0Our non-cancelable operating leases and finance lease obligations are primarily related to branch premises, equipment, and a portion of the Company\u2019s headquarters\u2019 building with lease terms extending through 2052.  Purchase obligations arise from agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding.  Other contracts included in purchase obligations primarily consist of service agreements for various systems and applications supporting bank operations.  Pension and postretirement benefit contributions represent the minimum expected contribution to the unfunded non-qualified pension plan and postretirement benefit plan.  Actual contributions may differ from these estimates.\u00a0\u00a0For information regarding material contractual obligations, please see Note 14 Employee Benefits, Note 18 Affordable Housing Projects Tax Credit Partnerships, Note 19 Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase, Note 20 Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees, and Note 23 Leases in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n\nForeign Activities\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCross-border outstandings are defined as loans (including accrued interest), acceptances, interest-bearing deposits with other banks, other interest-bearing investments, and any other monetary assets which are denominated in dollars or other non-local currency.\u00a0\u00a0As of December\u00a031, 2021, December\u00a031, 2020, and December\u00a031, 2019, we did not have cross-border outstandings to any foreign country which exceeded 0.75% of our total assets.\n\n\nCorporate Risk Profile\n\n\nManaging risk is an essential part of successfully operating our business.\u00a0\u00a0Management believes that the most prominent risk exposures for the Company are credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk management, capital management, and operational risk.\n\n\nCredit Risk\n\n\nCredit risk is the risk that borrowers or counterparties will be unable or unwilling to repay their obligations in accordance with the underlying contractual terms.\u00a0\u00a0We manage and control credit risk in the loan and lease portfolio by adhering to well-defined underwriting criteria and account administration standards established by management.\u00a0\u00a0Written credit policies document underwriting standards, approval levels, exposure limits, and other guidelines deemed necessary and prudent.\u00a0\u00a0Portfolio exposure at the obligor, industry, product, and/or geographic location levels is actively monitored to manage concentration risk.\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, credit risk management also includes an independent credit review process that assesses compliance with commercial and consumer credit policies, risk ratings, and other critical credit information.\u00a0\u00a0In addition to utilizing risk management practices that are based upon established and sound lending practices, we adhere to Regulatory Safety and Soundness credit standards.\u00a0\u00a0This includes understanding and evaluating our customers\u2019 borrowing needs and capacity to repay, in conjunction with specific risks in their line of business, economic factors, character and history.\n\n\nCommercial and industrial loans are made primarily for the purpose of financing equipment acquisition, expansion, working capital, and other general business purposes.\u00a0\u00a0Lease financing primarily consists of sales-type leases and leveraged leases that are used by commercial customers to finance capital purchases ranging from computer equipment to transportation equipment.\u00a0\u00a0The credit decisions for these transactions are based upon an assessment of the overall financial capacity of the applicant.\u00a0\u00a0A determination is made as to the applicant\u2019s ability to repay in accordance with the proposed terms as well as an overall assessment of the risks involved.\u00a0\u00a0In addition to an evaluation of the applicant\u2019s financial condition, a determination is made of the probable adequacy of the primary and secondary sources of repayment, such as additional collateral or personal guarantees, to be relied upon in the transaction.\u00a0\u00a0Credit agency reports of the applicant\u2019s credit history supplement the analysis of the applicant\u2019s and/or Guarantor\u2019s creditworthiness.\n\n\nCommercial mortgages and construction loans are offered to real estate investors, developers, builders, and owner-occupants primarily domiciled in Hawaii.\u00a0\u00a0These loans are secured by first mortgages on real estate at loan-to-value (\u201cLTV\u201d) ratios deemed appropriate based on the property type, location, overall quality, and sponsorship.\u00a0\u00a0Generally, these LTV ratios do not exceed 75%.\u00a0\u00a0The commercial properties are predominantly retail centers, apartments, industrial properties, office properties and, to a lesser extent, more specialized properties such as hotels.\u00a0\u00a0Commercial mortgage and construction loans are substantially secured by properties located in Hawaii.\n\n\n38\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCommercial mortgage loans are underwritten\n based on the economic fundamentals of the property and the creditworthiness of the borrower.\u00a0\u00a0In evaluating a proposed commercial mortgage loan, we primarily emphasize the ratio of the property\u2019s projected net cash flows to the loan\u2019s debt serv\nicing\n requirement.\u00a0\u00a0The debt service coverage ratio normally is not less than 12\n5\n% and it is computed after deducting for a vacancy factor and property expenses as appropriate.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, a personal guarantee of the loan or a portion thereof is sometimes required from the principal(s) of the borrower.\u00a0\u00a0We typically require title insurance insuring the priority of our lien, fire, and extended coverage casualty insurance, and flood insurance, if appropriate, in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, business interruption insurance or other insurance may be required.\u00a0\u00a0Owner-occupant commercial mortgage loans are underwritten based upon the cash flow of the business provided that the real estate asset is utilized in the operation of the business.\u00a0\u00a0Real estate is evaluated independently as a secondary source of repayment.\u00a0\u00a0As noted above, LTV \nrat\nios generally do not exceed 75%, \nwhich are based on regulatory-compliant appraisals that we obtain for the underlying properties.\n\n\nConstruction loans are underwritten against projected cash flows derived from rental income, business income from an owner-occupant, or the sale of the property to an end-user.\u00a0\u00a0We may mitigate the risks associated with these types of loans by requiring fixed-price construction contracts, performance and payment bonding, controlled disbursements, and pre-sale contracts or pre-lease agreements.\n\n\nWe offer a variety of first mortgage and junior lien loans to consumers within our markets with residential home mortgages comprising our largest loan category.\u00a0\u00a0These loans are secured by a primary residence, secondary residence, or investor property and are underwritten to assess the credit risks and financial capacity and repayment ability of the applicant.\u00a0\u00a0Decisions are primarily based on LTV ratios, debt-to-income (\u201cDTI\u201d) ratios, liquidity, and credit scores.\u00a0\u00a0LTV ratios generally do not exceed 80%, although higher levels are permitted with mortgage insurance.\u00a0\u00a0We offer variable rate mortgage loans with interest rates that are subject to change every six months after the third, fifth, seventh, or tenth year, depending on the product and are based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d).\u00a0\u00a0Variable rate mortgage loans are underwritten at fully-indexed interest rates.\u00a0\u00a0We do not offer payment-option facilities, sub-prime or Alt-A loans, or any product with negative amortization.\u00a0\u00a0We selectively offer interest-only mortgage loans to private banking clients.\n\n\nHome equity loans are secured by either first or second liens on a primary residence, secondary residence, or investor property. The underwriting terms for the home equity product generally permits borrowing availability, in the aggregate, up to 85% of the value of the collateral property at the time of origination.\u00a0\u00a0We offer fixed and variable rate home equity loans, with variable rate loans underwritten at fully-indexed interest rates.\u00a0\u00a0Our procedures for underwriting home equity loans include an assessment of an applicant\u2019s overall financial capacity and repayment ability.\u00a0\u00a0Decisions are primarily based on LTV ratios, DTI ratios, liquidity and credit scores.\u00a0\u00a0Maximum loan amounts and LTVs are determined by collateral value and channel.\n\n\nAutomobile lending activities include loans and leases secured by new or used automobiles.\u00a0\u00a0We originate automobile loans on an indirect basis through selected dealerships in Hawaii, Guam and Saipan, and we originate automobile leases on an indirect basis through selected dealerships in Hawaii.\u00a0\u00a0Our procedures for underwriting automobile loans and leases include an assessment of an applicant\u2019s overall financial capacity and repayment ability.\u00a0\u00a0Although an applicant\u2019s creditworthiness is the primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the automobile collateral to the proposed loan amount.\u00a0\u00a0We require borrowers to maintain full coverage automobile insurance on automobile loans and leases, with the Bank listed as either the loss payee or additional insured.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n39\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNon-Performing Assets and Accruing Loans and Leases Past Due 90 Days or More\n\n\nTable\u00a016 presents a

consist of non-accrual loans and leases and foreclosed real estate.\u00a0 Changes in the level of non-accrual loans and leases typically represent are caused by loans and leases that reach a specified past due status, offset by reductions for loans and leases that are charged-off, paid down, sold, transferred to foreclosed real estate, or are no longer classified as non-accrual because they have returned to accrual status.\n\n\nResidential mortgage non-accrual loans increased by $0.1 million or 3% from December\u00a031, 2020.\u00a0\u00a0As of December\u00a031, 2021, our residential mortgage non-accrual loans were comprised of eleven loans with a weighted average current LTV ratio of 58%.\n\n\nForeclosed real estate represents property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans.\u00a0 Foreclosed real estate is recorded at fair value, less estimated selling costs, at the time of foreclosure.\u00a0 On an ongoing basis, properties are appraised as required by market conditions and applicable regulations.\u00a0 Foreclosed real estate as of December\u00a031, 2021 was unchanged from December\u00a031, 2020.\n\n\nIf interest due on the balances of all non-accrual loans as of December\u00a031, 2021, had been accrued under the original terms, approximately $0.8 million in total interest income would have been recorded in 2021.\n\n\nLoans and Leases Past Due 90 Days or More and Still Accruing Interest\n\n\nLoans and leases in this category are 90 days or more past due, as to principal or interest, and are still accruing interest because they are well-secured and in the process of collection.\u00a0 Loans and leases past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest were $7.8 million as of December\u00a031, 2021, a $2.8 million or 26% decrease from December\u00a031, 2020.\u00a0 This decrease was primarily in our residential mortgage portfolio.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLoans Modified in a Troubled Debt Restructuring\n\n\nTable\u00a018 presents

borrowers during the COVID-19 national emergency.  These modifications generally involve principal and/or interest payment deferrals for up to six months.\u00a0\u00a0Similar to the initial modifications granted, the additional round of loan modifications generally involve principal and/or interest payment deferrals for up to an additional six months for commercial and consumer loans, and principal-only deferrals for up to an additional 12 months for selected commercial loans.\u00a0\u00a0The Company generally continues to accrue and recognize interest income during the deferral period.\u00a0\u00a0The Company offers several repayment options such as immediate repayment, repayment over a designated time period or as a balloon payment at maturity, or by extending the loan term.\u00a0\u00a0These modifications generally do not involve forgiveness or interest rate reductions.\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with Section 4013 of the CARES Act and the joint agency statement issued by banking agencies, these initial COVID-19 related loan and lease modifications are not accounted for as TDRs.\u00a0\u00a0As of December 31, 2021, these COVID-19 related loan and lease modifications totaled $40.5 million (8 loans and leases) for the commercial segment, in which interest payments continued to be received for all loans, and $3.1 million (11 loans and leases) for the consumer segment.\u00a0\u00a0See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\u00a0\u00a0Loans in a deferral program will continue to accrue interest during the deferral period unless otherwise classified as nonperforming.\u00a0\u00a0The provisions of the CARES Act and the interagency guidance issued by Federal banking regulators provided clarification related to modifications and deferral programs to assist borrowers who are negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0\u00a0The guidance and clarifications detail certain provisions whereby banks are permitted to make deferrals and modifications to the terms of a loan which would not require the loans be reported as TDRs.\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with the CARES Act and the interagency guidance, we elected to not report qualified loan modifications as TDRs.\u00a0\u00a0The relief related to TDRs under the CARES Act was extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021.\u00a0\u00a0Under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, relief under the CARES Act will continue until the earlier of (i) 60 days after the date the COVID-19 national emergency comes to an end or (ii) January 1, 2022.\u00a0\u00a0We do not know if the date will be extended beyond January 1, 2022 and it is possible that a failure to extend the date will result in an increase in the volume of loans considered TDRs.\u00a0\u00a0It is also unknown whether customers currently on a deferral period will be able to perform under the original terms of the loan once the deferral period ends.\u00a0\u00a0Any such inability to perform may result in increases in past due and nonperforming loans.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nReserve for Credit Losses\n\n\nThe reserve for credit losses consists of the Allowance

or 1.29% of total loans and leases outstanding (1.32% excluding PPP loans),\u00a0compared with an Allowance of $216.3 million or 1.81% of total loans and leases outstanding (1.89% excluding PPP loans) as of December 31, 2020.\u00a0\u00a0The decrease in the Allowance and the ratio of Allowance to loans and leases outstanding was primarily due to management\u2019s best estimate of losses over the life of loans and leases in our portfolio in accordance with the CECL approach, given the economic outlook, consumer delinquency rates, post deferral consumer payment trends, low commercial delinquency rates post-deferral, strong commercial performance and liquidity levels, and forecasts for COVID-19 pandemic driven market changes, as well as the cumulative impact of the intervention of fiscal, monetary and regulatory programs.  The CECL approach requires an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure (or pool of exposures).  It removes the incurred loss approach\u2019s threshold that delayed the recognition of a credit loss until it was probable a loss event was incurred.\n\n\n44\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNet charge-offs of loans \nand leases were \n$6.0 million\n \nor \n0.05%\n of total average loans and leases in \n2021\n compared to \n$7.1 million\n \nor \n0.06%\n of total average loans and leases in \n2020\n.\u00a0\u00a0\nNet charge-offs in our consumer portfolios were \n$5.4 million\n \nin \n2021\n \ncompared to \n$7.8 million\n in \n2020\n.\u00a0\u00a0This decrease was primarily reflected in our \nother and \nautomobile portfolio.\u00a0\u00a0Net \ncharge-offs \nin our commercial portfolios were \n$0.6 million\n \nin \n2021\n compared to net \nrecoveries \nof \n$0.6 million\n \nin \n2020\n.\u00a0\u00a0This \nincrease\n \nin\n \ncharge-offs\n \nwas primarily reflected in our commercial \nand industrial \nportfolio.\n\n\nAlthough we determine the amount of each component of the Allowance separately, the Allowance as a whole was considered appropriate by management as of December\u00a031, 2021, based on our ongoing analysis of estimated probable credit losses, credit risk profiles, economic conditions, coverage ratios, and other relevant factors.\n\n\nThe allocation of the Allowance to our commercial portfolio segment decreased by $19.9 million or 23% from December\u00a031, 2020.\u00a0\u00a0This reduction was primarily due to a $15.4 million decrease in the Allowance allocated to the commercial and industrial portfolio, a $1.7 million decrease in the Allowance allocated to the commercial mortgage portfolio, and a $1.6 million decrease in the Allowance allocated to the lease financing portfolio.  The reductions were primarily due to improving economic conditions and lower risk rating migration expectations.\n\n\nThe allocation of the Allowance to our consumer portfolio segment decreased by $38.5 million or 29% from December\u00a031, 2020.\u00a0\u00a0This reduction was due to a $19.1 million decrease in the Allowance allocated to the home equity portfolio, an $11.9 million decrease in the Allowance allocated to the residential mortgage portfolio, and reductions in the Allowance allocated to the automobile and other portfolios, each totaling $3.8 million.\u00a0\u00a0The reductions were primarily due to improving economic conditions and lower loss forecasts. \n\n\nSee Note\u00a04 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Allowance and credit quality indicators.\n\n\nReserve for Unfunded Commitments\n\n\nThe Unfunded Reserve was $6.1 million as of December\u00a031, 2021, and $2.4 million as of December\u00a031, 2020, an increase of $3.7 million, which was primarily due to the impact of risk rating migrations for certain commitments that were largely unfunded.\n\n\nProvision for Credit Losses\n\n\nThe provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $50.5 million in 2021 and a net expense of $117.8 million in 2020.\u00a0\u00a0This decrease was primarily due to management\u2019s best estimate of losses over the life of loans and leases in our portfolio in accordance with the CECL approach, given the economic outlook, consumer delinquency rates, post deferral consumer payment trends, low commercial delinquency rates post-deferral, strong commercial performance and liquidity levels, and forecasts for COVID-19 pandemic driven market changes, as well as the cumulative impact of the intervention of fiscal, monetary and regulatory programs.\n\n\nOther Credit Risks\n\n\nIn the normal course of business, we serve the needs of state and political subdivisions in multiple capacities, including traditional banking products such as deposit services, and by investing in municipal debt securities.\u00a0\u00a0The carrying value of our municipal debt securities was $75.8 million as of December\u00a031, 2021, and $58.6 million as of December\u00a031, 2020.\u00a0\u00a0We also maintained investments in corporate bonds with a carrying value of $403.4 million as of December\u00a031, 2021, and $236.6 million as of December\u00a031, 2020.\u00a0\u00a0We are exposed to credit risk in these investments should the issuer of a security be unable to meet its financial obligations.\u00a0\u00a0This may result in the issuer failing to make scheduled interest payments and/or being unable to repay the principal upon maturity.\n\n\nOur use of derivative financial instruments exposes the Company to counterparty credit risk.\u00a0\u00a0See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\n\n\nMarket Risk\n\n\nMarket risk is the potential of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and prices.\u00a0 We are exposed to market risk as a consequence of the normal course of conducting our business activities.\u00a0 Our market risk management process involves measuring, monitoring, and mitigating risks that can significantly impact our statements of income and condition.\u00a0 In this management process, market risks are balanced with expected returns in an effort to enhance earnings performance while limiting volatility.\n\n\nOur primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk.\n\n\n45\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\n\nThe objective of our interest rate risk management process is to optimize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.\u00a0\u00a0The potential cash flows, sales, or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities, especially those that earn or pay interest, are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates.\u00a0 This interest rate risk arises primarily from our core business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits.\u00a0\u00a0Our investment securities portfolio is also subject to significant interest rate risk.\n\n\nMany factors affect our exposure to changes in interest rates, such as general economic and financial conditions, customer preferences, historical pricing relationships, and repricing characteristics of financial instruments.\u00a0\u00a0Our earnings are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S.\u00a0and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve Bank (the \u201cFRB\u201d).\u00a0 The monetary policies of the FRB can influence the overall growth of loans, investment securities, and deposits and the level of interest rates earned on assets and paid for liabilities.\n\n\nIn managing interest rate risk, we, through the Asset/Liability Management Committee (\u201cALCO\u201d), measure short and long-term sensitivities to changes in interest rates.\u00a0 The ALCO, which is comprised of members of executive management, utilizes several techniques to manage interest rate risk, which include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nadjusting the statement of condition mix or altering the interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nchanging product pricing strategies;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nmodifying characteristics of the investment securities portfolio; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nusing derivative financial instruments.\n\n\nOur use of derivative financial instruments, as detailed in Note\u00a017 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, has generally been limited.\u00a0 This is due to natural on-balance sheet hedges arising out of offsetting interest rate exposures from loans and investment securities with deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities.\u00a0 In particular, the investment securities portfolio is utilized to manage the interest rate exposure and sensitivity to within the guidelines established by the ALCO.\u00a0 We utilize natural and offsetting economic hedges in an effort to reduce the need to employ off-balance sheet derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk exposures.\u00a0 Expected movements in interest rates are also considered in managing interest rate risk.\u00a0 Thus, as interest rates change, we may use different techniques to manage interest rate risk.\n\n\nA key element in our ongoing process to measure and monitor interest rate risk is the utilization of an asset/liability simulation model that attempts to capture the dynamic nature of the statement of condition.\u00a0 The model is used to estimate and measure the statement of condition sensitivity to changes in interest rates.\u00a0 These estimates are based on assumptions about the behavior of loan and deposit pricing, repayment rates on mortgage-based assets, and principal amortization and maturities on other financial instruments.\u00a0 The model\u2019s analytics include the effects of standard prepayment options on mortgages and customer withdrawal options for deposits.\u00a0 While such assumptions are inherently uncertain, we believe that our assumptions are reasonable.\n\n\nWe utilize net interest income simulations to analyze short-term income sensitivities to changes in interest rates.\u00a0 Table\u00a021 presents, for the twelve months subsequent to December\u00a031, 2021, and December\u00a031, 2020, an estimate of the change in net interest income that would result from a gradual and immediate change in interest rates, moving in a parallel fashion over the entire yield curve, relative to the measured base case scenario.\u00a0 The base case scenario assumes the statement of condition and interest rates are generally unchanged.\u00a0 Based on our net interest income simulation as of December\u00a031, 2021, net interest income is expected to increase as interest rates rise.\u00a0\u00a0This is due in part to our strategy to maintain a relatively short investment portfolio duration.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, rising interest rates would drive higher rates on loans and investment securities, as well as induce a slower pace of premium amortization on certain securities within our investment portfolio.\u00a0\u00a0However, lower interest rates would likely cause a decline in net interest income as lower rates would lead to lower yields on loans and investment securities, as well as drive higher premium amortization on existing investment securities.\u00a0\u00a0Based on our net interest income simulation as of December\u00a031, 2021, net interest income sensitivity to changes in interest rates for the twelve months subsequent to December\u00a031, 2021, was more sensitive in comparison to the sensitivity profile for the twelve months subsequent to December\u00a031, 2020.\u00a0\u00a0Year-over-year asset sensitivity increased due to faster forecasted prepayments for mortgage-related assets due to the lower rate environment, higher liquidity, as well as higher balances in mortgage-backed securities and in floating rate commercial mortgage loans.\n\n\n46\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet Interest

analyze the impact of changes in interest rates in a more realistic manner, non-parallel interest rate scenarios are also simulated.\u00a0\u00a0These non-parallel interest rate scenarios indicate that net interest income may decrease from the base case scenario should the yield curve flatten or become inverted for a period of time.\u00a0\u00a0Conversely, if the yield curve were to steepen, net interest income may increase.\n\n\nOther Market Risks\n\n\nIn addition to interest rate risk, we are exposed to other forms of market risk in our normal business transactions.\u00a0\u00a0Foreign currency and foreign exchange contracts expose us to a small degree of foreign currency risk.\u00a0\u00a0These transactions are primarily executed on behalf of customers.\u00a0\u00a0Our trust and asset management income is at risk to fluctuations in the market values of underlying assets, particularly debt and equity securities.\u00a0\u00a0Also, our share-based compensation expense is dependent on the fair value of our stock options, restricted stock units, and restricted stock at the date of grant.\u00a0\u00a0The fair value of stock options, restricted stock units, and restricted stock is impacted by the market price of the Parent\u2019s common stock on the date of grant and is at risk to changes in equity markets, general economic conditions, and other factors.\n\n\nLiquidity Risk Management\n\n\nThe objective of our liquidity risk management process is to manage cash flow and liquidity in an effort to provide continuous access to sufficient, reasonably priced funds.\u00a0 Funding requirements are impacted by loan originations and refinancings, deposit balance changes, liability issuances and settlements, and off-balance sheet funding commitments.\u00a0 We consider and comply with various regulatory guidelines regarding required liquidity levels and regularly monitor our liquidity position in light of the changing economic environment and customer activity.\u00a0 Based on ongoing liquidity assessments, we may alter our asset, liability, and off-balance sheet positions.\u00a0 The ALCO monitors sources and uses of funds and modifies asset and liability positions as liquidity requirements change.\u00a0 This process, combined with our ability to raise funds in money and capital markets and through private placements, provides flexibility in managing the exposure to liquidity risk.\n\n\nIn an effort to satisfy our liquidity needs, we actively manage our assets and liabilities.\u00a0 We have access to immediate liquid resources in the form of cash which is primarily on deposit with the FRB.\u00a0\u00a0Potential sources of liquidity also include investment securities in our available-for-sale securities portfolio, our ability to sell loans in the secondary market, and to secure borrowings from the FRB and FHLB.\u00a0 Our held-to-maturity securities, while not intended for sale, may also be utilized in repurchase agreements to obtain funding.\u00a0\u00a0Our core deposits have historically provided us with a long-term source of stable and relatively low cost source of funding.\u00a0 Additional funding is available through the issuance of long-term debt or equity.\n\n\nMaturities and payments on outstanding loans and investment securities also provide a steady flow of funds.\u00a0\u00a0Liquidity is further enhanced by our ability to access secured borrowings from the FHLB and FRB.\u00a0\u00a0As of December\u00a031, 2021, we could have borrowed an additional $3.0 billion from the FHLB and an additional $713.3 million from the FRB based on the amount of pledged loans and investment securities.\n\n\nWe continued our focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position throughout 2021.\u00a0\u00a0As of December\u00a031, 2021, cash and cash equivalents were $560.4 million, the carrying value of our available-for-sale investment securities was $4.3 billion, and total deposits were $20.4 billion.\u00a0\u00a0As of December\u00a031, 2021, our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio was comprised of securities with an average base duration of approximately 4.15 years.\n\n\n47\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCapital Management\n\n\nWe actively manage capital, commensurate with our risk profile, in our efforts to enhance shareholder value.\u00a0\u00a0We also seek to maintain capital levels for the Company and the Bank at amounts in excess of the regulatory \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d thresholds.\u00a0\u00a0Periodically, we may respond to market conditions by implementing changes to our overall balance sheet positioning to manage our capital position.\n\n\nThe Company and the Bank are each subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies.\u00a0 Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could cause certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, would likely have a material effect on our financial statements.\u00a0 Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative and qualitative measures.\u00a0 These measures were established by regulation intended to ensure capital adequacy.\u00a0 As of December\u00a031, 2021, the Company\u2019s capital levels remained characterized as \u201cwell-capitalized.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0The Company\u2019s regulatory capital ratios are presented in Table 22 below.\u00a0\u00a0Capital ratios are calculated using the regulatory capital rule that allows a five-year transition period related to the adoption of CECL.\u00a0 There have been no conditions or events since December\u00a031, 2021, that management believes have changed either the Company\u2019s or the Bank\u2019s capital classifications.\n\n\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, shareholders\u2019 equity was $1.6 billion, an increase of $237.1 million or 17% from December\u00a031, 2020.\u00a0\u00a0For 2021 net income of $253.4 million, net preferred stock issuance of $175.5 million, common stock issuances of $14.0 million, and share-based compensation of $13.3 million were offset by other comprehensive loss of $74.2 million, cash dividends of $110.6 million paid on common stock shares, cash dividends of $3.0 million paid on preferred stock shares, and common stock repurchases of $31.3 million.\u00a0\u00a0In 2021, included in the amount of common stock repurchased were 328,832 shares repurchased under our share repurchase program.\u00a0\u00a0These shares were repurchased at an average cost per share of $83.14 and a total cost of $27.3 million.\u00a0\u00a0From the beginning of our share repurchase program in July 2001 through December\u00a031, 2021, we repurchased a total of 57.4 million shares of common stock and returned a total of nearly $2.3 billion to our common shareholders at an average cost of $40.76 per share.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRemaining buyback authority was $85.7 million as of December\u00a031, 2021.\u00a0\u00a0We suspended share repurchases from March 2020 to July 2021 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The actual amount and timing of future share repurchases, if any, will depend on market and economic conditions, regulatory rules, applicable SEC rules, and various other factors.\n\n\nOn June 15, 2021, the Company issued and sold 7,200,000 depositary shares (the \u201cdepositary shares\u201d), each representing a 1/40th ownership interest in a share of 4.375% Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $0.01 per share (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d).\u00a0\u00a0The Series A Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share.\u00a0 Net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and expenses, totaled $175.5 million.\u00a0\u00a0Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are not cumulative and will be paid when declared by the Parent\u2019s Board of Directors to the extent that we have legally available funds to pay dividends.\u00a0\u00a0If declared, dividends will accrue and be payable quarterly, in arrears, on the liquidation preference amount, on a non-cumulative basis, at a rate of 4.375% per annum.\u00a0\u00a0Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will not have voting rights, except with respect to certain changes in the terms of the preferred stock, certain dividend non-payments and as otherwise required by applicable law. \u00a0The Company may redeem the Series A Preferred Stock at its option, (i) in whole or in part, from time to time, on any dividend payment date on or after August 1, 2026 or (ii) in whole but not in part, at any time within 90 days following a regulatory capital treatment event, in either case at a redemption price equal to $1,000 per share (equivalent to $25 per depositary share), plus any declared and unpaid dividends.\n\n\nIn January 2022, the Parent\u2019s Board of Directors declared the quarterly dividend of its Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, of $10.94 per share, equivalent to $0.2735 per depositary share.  The dividend was paid on February 1, 2022, to shareholders of record of the preferred stock at the close of business on January 18, 2022.\n\n\nIn January 2022, the Parent\u2019s Board of Directors declared the quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share on the Parent\u2019s outstanding common shares.\u00a0\u00a0The dividend will be payable on March\u00a014, 2022, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February\u00a028, 2022.\n\n\n48\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTable\u00a02\n2\n presents a five-year history of activities and balances in our capital accounts,

guidelines for U.S. banks minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company.\u00a0\u00a0The Basel III capital standards substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries, including the definitions and the components of Tier 1 capital and Total Capital, the method of evaluating risk-weighted assets, institution of a capital conservation buffer, and other matters affecting regulatory capital ratios.\u00a0\u00a0Strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments were also implemented under the rules.\n\n\nThe phase-in period for the final rules became effective for the Company on January 1, 2015, with full compliance with all of the final rules\u2019 requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule, which were fully implemented on January 1, 2019.\u00a0\u00a0As of December\u00a031, 2021, the Company\u2019s capital levels remained characterized as \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d under the new rules.\n\n\nManagement continues to monitor regulatory developments and their potential impact to the Company\u2019s liquidity requirements.\n\n\nStress Testing\n\n\nEnactment of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act in May 2018 significantly altered several provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including how stress tests are run.\u00a0 Bank holding companies with total assets of less than $100 billion, such as the Company, are no longer subject to company-run stress testing requirements in section 165(i)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act, including publishing a summary of results.\u00a0 At this time, the Company continues to run internal stress tests as a component of our comprehensive risk management and capital planning process.\n\n\n49\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCARES Act\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn March 27, 2020, President Trump signed the CARES Act into law. \u00a0Many of

COVID-19 pandemic to provide cash flow assistance to employers who maintained their payroll (including healthcare and certain related expenses), mortgage interest, rent, leases, utilities and interest on existing debt during this emergency.\u00a0\u00a0The funding period of the PPP has ended on May 31, 2021.\u00a0\u00a0Pursuant to the provisions of Section\u00a01106 of the CARES Act, borrowers may apply to the Bank for loan forgiveness of all or a portion of the loan, subject to certain eligibility requirements and conditions.\n\n\nIn 2021, the Bank participated in the second round of the PPP.\u00a0\u00a0The expertise and diligence of our PPP team enabled us to process more than 3,400 PPP loans totaling over $287 million in 2021.\u00a0\u00a0The combined Bank of Hawaii PPP loans processed in 2020 and 2021 were almost 8,000 loans totaling over $830 million.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, to assist Hawaii business, the Bank processed more than 7,500 PPP loan forgiveness applications totaling more than $700 million in federal funding.\n\n\nOperational Risk\n\n\nOperational risk represents the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including, but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside the Company, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, failure to adhere to compliance requirements, and the risk of cyber attacks.\u00a0\u00a0We are also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of our outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to our business.\u00a0 The risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity.\u00a0\u00a0Operational risk is inherent in all business activities, and management of this risk is important to the achievement of Company goals and objectives.\n\n\nOur Operational Risk Committee (the \u201cORC\u201d) provides oversight and assesses the most significant operational risks facing the Company.\u00a0\u00a0We have developed a framework that provides for a centralized operating risk management function through the ORC, supplemented by business unit responsibility for managing operational risks specific to their business units.\u00a0\u00a0Our internal audit department also validates the system of internal controls through ongoing risk-based audit procedures and reports on the effectiveness of internal controls to executive management and the Audit and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\n\nWe continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of operational risk.\u00a0\u00a0While our internal controls have been designed to minimize operational risks, there is no assurance that business disruption or operational losses will not occur.\u00a0\u00a0On an ongoing basis, management reassesses operational risks, implements appropriate process changes, and invests in enhancements to our systems of internal controls.\n\n\nGuarantees\n\n\nWe pool Federal Housing Administration (\u201cFHA\u201d) insured and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) guaranteed residential mortgage loans for sale to Ginnie Mae.\u00a0\u00a0We also sell residential mortgage loans in the secondary market to Fannie Mae.\u00a0\u00a0The agreements under which we sell residential mortgage loans to Ginnie Mae or Fannie Mae and the insurance or guaranty agreements with the FHA and VA contain provisions that include various representations and warranties regarding the origination and characteristics of the residential mortgage loans.\u00a0\u00a0Although these loans are primarily sold on a non-recourse basis, we may be obligated to repurchase residential mortgage loans or reimburse the respective investor if it is found that required documents were not delivered or were defective.\n\n\nWe also service substantially all of the loans we sell to investors in the secondary market.\u00a0\u00a0Each agreement under which we act as servicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for our actions and provides protection against expenses and liabilities incurred by us when acting in compliance with the respective servicing agreements.\u00a0\u00a0However, if we commit a material breach of obligations as servicer, we may be subject to various penalties which may include the repurchase of an affected loan or a reimbursement to the respective investor.\n\n\nSee discussion of our risks related to representation and warranty provisions as well as our risks related to residential mortgage loan servicing activities in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\nTable of

income available for common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $61.9 million, an increase of $19.6 million or 46% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.\u00a0\u00a0Diluted earnings per common share were $1.55 for the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $0.49 or 46% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\n\nNet Interest Income\n\n\nNet interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $126.7 million, an increase of $6.9 million or 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.\u00a0\u00a0This increase was primarily due to increase in investment securities portfolio, higher PPP income, and decrease in interest expense on time deposits.\u00a0\u00a0Net interest margin was 2.34% for the fourth quarter of 2021, a decrease of 14 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2020\n, p\nrimarily due to lower yields in our investment securities and loans portfolio.\n\n\n51\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nProvision for Credit Losses\n\n\nThe provision for credit losses for the fourth quarter of 2021 was a net benefit of $9.7 million compared to a net expense of $15.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, while recording a net charge-off of loans and leases of $0.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to a net recovery of $0.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\n\nNoninterest Income\n\n\nNoninterest income, other than net gains on sales of investment securities, was $43.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, a decrease of $2.6 million or 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.\u00a0\u00a0This decrease was primarily due to a $3.9 million decrease in mortgage banking due to lower volume and customer derivatives.\n  In addition,\n other income decreased by $1.7 million due to a decrease in fees related to our customer interest rate swap derivatives. These decreases were partially offset by a $2.3 million increase in \nfees, exchange, \nmerchant\n income,\n and other service charges due to \nhigher ATM, merchant services, and debit and credit card transaction volume.\n \n\n\nNoninterest Expense\n\n\nNoninterest expense was $101.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $3.0 million or 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.\u00a0\u00a0This increase was primarily due to a $9.2 million increase in salaries and benefits due to increase in corporate incentive plans, medical, dental, and life insurance and share-based compensation of $3.6 million, $2.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively. These increases were offset by $5.5 million decrease in net occupancy expense primarily due to the closure of 12 branches in the fourth quarter of 2020 for a total exit cost of $5.6 million.\n\n\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\n\nThe provision for income taxes was $13.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $4.6 million or 53% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.\u00a0\u00a0The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 17.08% compared with an effective tax rate of 16.87% for the fourth quarter of 2020.\u00a0\u00a0The difference in the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the same period of 2020 was primarily due to higher pretax income in 2021, partially offset by higher tax benefits in 2021.\n\n\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program\n\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we repurchased 87,500 shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at an average cost per share of $83.83 and a total cost of $7.3 million.
