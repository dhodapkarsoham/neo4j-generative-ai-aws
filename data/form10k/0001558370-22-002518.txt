{"item1": ">ITEM 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BUSINESS\n\u200b\nOrganization\nGlobal Medical REIT\u00a0Inc. (the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) is a Maryland corporation engaged primarily in the acquisition of purpose-built healthcare facilities and the leasing of those facilities to strong healthcare systems and physician groups with leading market share. The Company\u2019s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. \u00a0\nUntil July 9, 2020, we were externally managed and advised by our former advisor. On July 9, 2020, we completed our management internalization transaction, whereby the management agreement with the former advisor was terminated, the employees of the former advisor became our employees, and the functions previously performed by the former advisor were internalized by us. \n \nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2016. We conduct our business through an umbrella partnership real estate investment trust, or UPREIT, structure in which our properties are owned by wholly owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership, Global Medical REIT\u00a0L.P. (the \u201cOperating Partnership\u201d). Our wholly owned subsidiary, Global Medical REIT GP LLC, is the sole general partner of our Operating Partnership and, as of December 31, 2021, we owned 94.35% of the outstanding common operating partnership units (\u201cOP Units\u201d) of our Operating Partnership with an aggregate of 5.65% of the Operating Partnership owned by holders of long-term incentive plan units (\u201cLTIP Units\u201d) and third-party limited partners who contributed properties or services to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units.\nBusiness Overview and Strategy\nOur business strategy is to invest in healthcare properties that provide an attractive rate of return relative to our cost of capital and are operated by profitable physician groups, regional or national healthcare systems or combinations thereof. We believe this strategy allows us to attain our goals of providing stockholders with (i) reliable dividends and (ii) stock price appreciation. To implement this strategy, we seek to invest:\n\u25cf\nin medical office buildings and other de-centralized components of the healthcare delivery system because we believe that healthcare delivery trends in the U.S. are increasingly moving away from centralized hospital locations;\n\u25cf\nin small to mid-sized healthcare facilities located in secondary markets and suburbs of primary markets and \nthat provide services needed for an aging population such as cardiovascular treatment, rehabilitation, eye surgery, gastroenterology, oncology treatment and orthopedics. We believe these facilities and markets are typically overlooked by larger REITs and other healthcare investors but contain tenant credit profiles that are like those of larger, more expensive facilities in primary markets; and\n\u25cf\nto a lesser extent, in opportunistic acquisitions, including (i) certain acute-care hospitals and long-term acute care facilities (LTACs) that we believe provide premium, risk-adjusted returns, (ii) health system corporate office and administrative buildings, which we believe will help us develop relationships with larger health systems and (iii) behavioral and mental health facilities that are operated by national or regional operators and are located in markets that demonstrate a need for such services.\nMost of our healthcare facilities are leased to single-tenants under triple-net leases. As we continue to grow our portfolio and the competition for single-tenant, triple-net leased properties has intensified, we have added to our portfolio some multi-tenant properties with gross lease or modified gross lease structures. \u00a0\n\u200b\nCorporate Sustainability and Social Responsibility  \n\u200b\nOur business values integrate environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and strong governance practices throughout our Company. \n\u200b\n5\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe continue to improve and expand our efforts in the corporate sustainability arena through tenant outreach and data collection to benchmark our portfolio\u2019s energy consumption and efficiency. The 2020 GRESB assessment report results, when compared to the 2019 report, showed significant progress, with an increase in our total score from\u00a021\u00a0in 2019 to\u00a042 in 2020.\n\u200b\nOur commitment to employee engagement remains a high-priority, as we continue to make accommodations for health, safety, and work-life balance. With this commitment in mind, and with the leadership of the compensation committee of the Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) leadership, we conducted an employee survey that covered a comprehensive range of subjects related to our employees\u2019 attitudes about our work culture, compensation components, as well as demographic and identification data. \n\u200b\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, our employee environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) working group engaged Georgetown University\u2019s Steers Center for Global Real Estate to help us identify social responsibility initiatives that are in alignment with our business objectives. Their recommendation led to a pilot project that provides transportation to healthcare facilities for those in need. We are working with a ride-share provider and national charitable organization to implement the project in the greater Phoenix, Arizona metro area.\n\u200b\nOur Board continues to lead our social and governance efforts. With its diverse composition, our Board is a strong example of inclusive leadership. The Board has continued to improve our corporate governance structure by adopting an anti-hedging and anti-pledging policy, executive equity ownership guidelines, and an incentive compensation recoupment (clawback) policy. The Board has also formed a standing ESG committee that will oversee the Company\u2019s environmental, social, governance and resilience efforts. \u00a0 \u00a0Previously, our Board provided this oversight through an informal ESG working group. \n\u200b\nClimate Change\n\u200b\nWe take climate change and the risks associated with climate change seriously. We are committed to aligning our investment strategy with science and have begun to monitor our portfolio for climate risk factors. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we initiated the implementation of utility and energy audits to be performed by third-party engineering consultants during the due diligence phase of our acquisitions. The energy consumption data that we are collecting will be used to assess our facilities\u2019 carbon emission levels. Capturing and tracking this information will help inform future mitigation and remediation efforts where possible. To that end, we are exploring ways to mitigate climate risk, should it be present, in our acquisition strategy, as well as ways to contribute to the reduction of climate impact through proactive asset management that looks for ways to incorporate renewable energy resources and energy utilization reduction. We stand with our communities, tenants, and stockholders in supporting meaningful solutions that address this global challenge and contribute to the sustainability of our business objectives.\n\u200b\nImpact of COVID-19 \nU.S economic growth in 2021 rebounded substantially from 2020 as COVID-19 vaccines became readily available to most of the U.S. population. However, the rapid spread of the Omicron variant beginning in late 2021 and the resulting increase in hospital admissions stressed the U.S. healthcare system, as more people sought treatment for COVID-19 infections and many healthcare workers were unavailable due to them having left the profession or being infected themselves. Many stories exist about U.S. healthcare workers experiencing burnout due to the length and severity of the pandemic, which has caused many healthcare workers to quit their professions. If this continues, healthcare practices, including our tenants, may experience staffing shortages or increased labor and recruitment costs, which could negatively impact their businesses.\nIn addition, the Omicron variant has caused widespread labor shortages outside of the healthcare industry. These labor shortages have affected several of the outside consultants we rely on to, among other services, complete our property acquisitions, which, in certain circumstances, has affected those consultants\u2019 ability to provide timely services to us. \u00a0\nThe volatility of COVID-19, as recently evidenced by the trajectory of the Omicron variant, is unpredictable and there are no assurances that an equally or more volatile variant will not emerge in the future. Although to date our liquidity and operational and financial performance has not been materially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the recent Omicron variant, we cannot predict the effects future resurgences will have on our tenants and our business.\n6\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur Properties\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021 we had gross investments of approximately $1.3 billion in real estate properties, consisting of 105 facilities with an aggregate of (i)\u00a0approximately 4.3 million leasable square feet and (ii)\u00a0approximately $103.1 million of annualized base rent.

We are currently in the due diligence period for our properties under contract. If we identify problems with any of these properties or the operator of any property during our due diligence review, we may not close the transactions on a timely basis or we may terminate the purchase agreements and not close the transactions.\nCapital Raising\nFrom December 31, 2021 through February 25, 2022, we generated gross proceeds of $8.3 million through ATM equity issuances of 0.5 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average offering price of $17.38 per share.\n\u200b\nHealthcare Industry and Healthcare Real Estate Market Opportunity\nWe believe our primary investment strategy takes advantage of current trends in healthcare and healthcare delivery, including an aging population and the decentralization of healthcare, while also providing flexibility to make opportunistic acquisitions and dispositions. \u00a0\nAging U.S. Population Driving Increase in Demand for Healthcare Services\nThe general aging of the population, driven by the baby boomer generation and advances in medical technology and services which increase life expectancy, is a key driver of the growth in healthcare expenditures. According to the 2020 U.S. Census, the nation\u2019s 65-and older population has grown rapidly since 2010, driven by Baby Boomers born between 1946 and 1964. The 65-and-older population grew by over a third during the past decade, and by 3.2% from 2018 to 2019. We believe that demographic trends in the United States, including an aging population, will result in continued growth in the demand for healthcare services utilized by an aging population, which in turn will lead to an increasing need for a greater supply of specialized, well-located healthcare facilities.\nClinical Care Continues to Shift Away from Large, Centralized Facilities\nWe believe the continued shift in the delivery of healthcare services away from large, centralized facilities to smaller, more specialized facilities will increase the need for smaller, more specialized and efficient hospitals and outpatient facilities that take advantage of these shifting trends. Procedures traditionally performed in large, general hospitals, such as certain types of surgeries, are increasingly moving to more conveniently located, specialized facilities driven by advances in clinical science, shifting consumer preferences, limited or inefficient space in existing hospitals and lower costs in the non-hospital environment.\nOpportunistic Acquisitions\nDespite the continued shift in the delivery of healthcare services to smaller, more specialized facilities, we believe opportunities exist to acquire larger, acute-care facilities, such as acute-care hospitals and LTACs, with very attractive submarket fundamentals at compelling valuations. Despite the trends away from acute-care facilities, we believe that certain, well-located acute-care hospitals and LTACs will still be critical components of the U.S. healthcare system.\nWe also opportunistically invest in large health system\u2019s corporate and administrative office buildings. We believe investments in these types of facilities helps us build relationships with large health systems, which could lead to us becoming a preferred landlord for such health systems\u2019 medical facilities.\nWe also invest in behavioral and mental health facilities that are operated by national or regional operators and are in markets that demonstrate a need for such services. \u00a0\nAlthough not the primary focus of our investment strategy, we believe allocating a portion of our portfolio to opportunistic acquisitions helps diversify our portfolio and is consistent with our strategy of aligning ourselves with strong operators.\n9\n\n\nTable of Contents\nDispositions \nAlthough not the primary focus of our investment strategy, we believe dispositions help to strengthen our portfolio and provide cash flow and gains from the sales. For example, we may decide to sell a property if, among other reasons, (i) we receive an unsolicited bid from a potential buyer at an attractive price, (ii) we wish to decrease our geographic or facility-type concentration risk, or (iii) a tenant\u2019s credit profile changes (e.g., a tenant is involved in a merger or acquisition transaction). \nOn October 5, 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell a medical office building located in Belpre, Ohio for gross proceeds of approximately $44.6 million. The property had a net book value of approximately $29.5 million as of December 31, 2021. The transaction is expected to be completed no earlier than June 2022. The buyer is currently in the due diligence period and the transaction is subject to various closing contingencies. Accordingly, the transaction may not close on a timely basis or the buyer may terminate the purchase agreement and not close the transaction. We intend to reinvest the sales proceeds in 2022.\nOn October 13, 2021, we sold a medical office building located in Prescott, Arizona receiving gross proceeds of $5.5 million, resulting in a gain of approximately $1.1 million. \u00a0\nQualification as a REIT\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our taxable\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2016. Subject to a number of significant exceptions, a corporation that qualifies as a REIT generally is not subject to U.S. federal corporate income taxes on income and gains that it distributes to its stockholders, thereby reducing its corporate-level taxes. In order to qualify as a REIT, a substantial\u00a0percentage of our assets must be qualifying real estate assets and a substantial\u00a0percentage of our income must be rental revenue from real property or interest on mortgage loans. We believe that we have been organized and have operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT, and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner. However, we cannot provide assurances that we will continue to operate in a manner to remain qualified as a REIT.\nCompetition\nWe compete with many other real estate investors for acquisitions of healthcare properties, including healthcare operators, and real estate investors such as private equity firms and other REITs, some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. The resiliency of medical office buildings during the COVID-19 pandemic caused many real estate investors to enter the market in search of reliable returns. \u00a0This influx of investors has caused medical office building prices and competition to increase significantly, especially for Class A properties in prime locations, but has also caused similar increases in our target markets. \u00a0\nAdditionally, our healthcare facilities and tenants often face competition from nearby hospitals, other medical practices, and other healthcare facilities, including urgent care and other primary care facilities, that provide comparable services. If our tenants\u2019 competitors have greater geographic coverage, improved access and convenience to physicians and patients, provide or are perceived to provide higher quality services, recruit physicians to provide competing services at their facilities, expand or improve their services or obtain more favorable managed-care contracts, our tenants may not be able to successfully compete.\nGovernment Programs, Laws and Regulations \nMedicare and Medicaid Programs\nSources of revenue for our tenants typically include the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Healthcare providers continue to face increased government pressure to control or reduce healthcare costs and significant reductions in healthcare reimbursement, including reduced reimbursements and changes to payment methodologies under the Affordable Care Act. In some cases, private insurers rely on all or portions of the Medicare payment systems to determine payment rates, which may result in decreased reimbursement from private insurers.\nThe need to control Medicaid expenditures may be exacerbated by the potential for increased enrollment in Medicaid programs due to unemployment and declines in family incomes. Historically, states have often attempted to reduce Medicaid spending by limiting benefits and tightening Medicaid eligibility requirements. Additionally, in early 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \n10\n\n\nTable of Contents\nissued guidance that would allow states to impose work requirements as a condition to Medicaid eligibility, which could dampen enrollment in the program.\nEfforts by Medicare and Medicaid to reduce reimbursements will likely continue, which could negatively affect our tenant\u2019s revenues and their ability to pay rent to us.\nAffordable Care Act\nThe Affordable Care Act is a comprehensive healthcare reform law that contains various provisions that may directly impact our tenants. The primary goal of the Affordable Care Act is to broaden insurance coverage for the uninsured population by expanding Medicaid coverage, creating health insurance exchanges and mandating that uninsured individuals purchase health insurance. The Affordable Care Act also contains provisions aimed at lowering the cost of healthcare, including lowering increases in Medicare payment rates and promoting alternate reimbursement methods for providers that focus on patient outcomes rather than volume. In addition to expanding coverage and controlling costs, the Affordable Care Act also contains provisions intended to combat healthcare fraud, including Medicare fraud and abuse. On June\u00a028, 2012, the United States Supreme Court partially invalidated the expansion of Medicaid and allowed states not to participate in the expansion without losing their existing Medicaid funding. In addition, on December\u00a022, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the TCJA. The TCJA eliminated the tax penalty for violating the individual mandate provision of the Affordable Care Act. \u00a0The U.S. Supreme Court recently heard oral arguments in a case (Texas v. Azar) challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. \u00a0No decision has yet been rendered on the case. \u00a0\nAlthough the Affordable Care Act\u2019s expansion of insurance coverage may benefit our tenants by increasing their number of insured patients, these benefits may be offset by the fact that (i)\u00a0many of the newly insured under the Affordable Care Act are insured by policies that have high deductibles (and, thus, create higher patient credit risks for our tenants), (ii)\u00a0some states have not implemented the Medicaid expansion or have implemented Medicaid expansion in such ways that may reduce potential enrollment (such as implementing work requirements), and, (iii)\u00a0even if states have expanded Medicaid, Medicaid may not be accepted by some of our tenants. For our tenants that do accept Medicaid, they may receive lower reimbursements for Medicaid patients than for patients with Medicare or commercial insurance. Additionally, although the migration from Medicare fee-for-service, or volume-based, payments to an outcome-based reimbursement model may lower overall healthcare costs, these changes could negatively affect our tenants if they are unable to adapt to a more outcome-oriented healthcare delivery model.\nThe future of the Affordable Care Act is uncertain and any changes to existing laws and regulations, including the Affordable Care Act\u2019s repeal, modification or replacement, could have a long-term financial impact on the delivery of and payment for healthcare. Both our tenants and us may be adversely affected by the law or its repeal, modification or replacement.\nFraud and Abuse Laws\nThere are various federal and state laws prohibiting fraudulent and abusive business practices by healthcare providers who participate in, receive payments from, or are able to make referrals in connection with, government-sponsored healthcare programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Our leases with certain tenants may also be subject to these fraud and abuse laws. These laws include, without limitation:\n\u25cf\nThe Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce, the referral of any U.S. federal or state healthcare program patients;\n\u25cf\nThe Federal Physician Self-Referral Prohibition (commonly called the \u201cStark Law\u201d), which, subject to specific exceptions, restricts physicians who have financial relationships with healthcare providers from making referrals for designated health services for which payment may be made under Medicare or Medicaid programs to an entity with which the physician, or an immediate family member, has a financial relationship;\n\u25cf\nThe False Claims Act, which prohibits any person from knowingly presenting false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government, including under the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u25cf\nThe Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to impose monetary penalties for certain fraudulent acts; and\n11\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u25cf\nState anti-kickback, anti-inducement, anti-referral and insurance fraud laws which may be generally similar to, and potentially more expansive than, the federal laws set forth above.\nViolations of these laws may result in criminal and/or civil penalties that range from punitive sanctions, damage assessments, penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments and/or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, the Affordable Care Act clarifies that the submission of claims for items or services generated in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the False Claims Act. The federal government has taken the position, and some courts have held, that violations of other laws, such as the Stark Law, can also be a violation of the False Claims Act. Additionally, certain laws, such as the False Claims Act, allow for individuals to bring whistleblower actions on behalf of the government for violations thereof. Imposition of any of these penalties upon one of our tenants could jeopardize that tenant\u2019s ability to operate or to make rent payments to us. Further, we enter into leases and other financial relationships with healthcare delivery systems that are subject to or impacted by these laws. We also have investors who are healthcare providers in our operating partnership. If any of our relationships, including those related to the other investors in our subsidiaries, are found not to comply with these laws, we and our physician investors may be subject to civil and/or criminal penalties.\nOther Regulations\nThe healthcare industry is heavily regulated by U.S. federal, state and local governmental authorities. Our tenants generally will be subject to laws and regulations covering, among other things, licensure, and certification for participation in government programs, billing for services, privacy and security of health information, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which provides for the privacy and security of certain individually identifiable health information, and relationships with physicians and other referral sources. In addition, new laws and regulations, changes in existing laws and regulations or changes in the interpretation of such laws or regulations could negatively affect our financial condition and the financial condition of our tenants. These changes, in some cases, could apply retroactively. The enactment, timing or effect of legislative or regulatory changes cannot be predicted.\nMany states regulate the construction of healthcare facilities, the expansion of healthcare facilities, the construction or expansion of certain services, including by way of example specific bed types and medical equipment, as well as certain capital expenditures through certificate of need, or CON, laws. Under such laws, the applicable state regulatory body must determine a need exists for a project before the project can be undertaken. If one of our tenants seeks to undertake a CON-regulated project but is not authorized by the applicable regulatory body to proceed with the project, the tenants would be prevented from operating in its intended manner.\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulations could adversely affect us directly and our tenants\u2019 ability to make rent payments to us.\nEnvironmental Regulations\nUnder various U.S. federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, current and prior owners and tenants of real estate may be jointly and severally liable for the costs of investigating, remediating, and monitoring certain hazardous substances or other regulated materials on or in such healthcare facility. In addition to these costs, the past or present owner or tenant of a healthcare facility from which a release emanates could be liable for any personal injury or property damage that results from such release, including for the unauthorized release of asbestos-containing materials and other hazardous substances into the air, as well as any damages to natural resources or the environment that arise from such releases. These environmental laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the current or prior owner or tenant knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or release of such substances or materials. Moreover, the release of hazardous substances or materials, or the failure to properly remediate such substances or materials, may adversely affect the owner\u2019s or tenant\u2019s ability to lease, sell, develop or rent such healthcare facility or to borrow by using such healthcare facility as collateral. \nCertain environmental laws impose compliance obligations on owners and tenants of real property with respect to the management of hazardous substances and other regulated materials. For example, environmental laws govern the management and removal of asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint. Failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties or other sanctions.\n12\n\n\nTable of Contents\nHuman Capital Resources\nOur success is dependent on the success of our employees. \nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had 26 employees.\nWe believe we offer a competitive pay and benefits package, with nearly all of our employees participating in our equity incentive plans. We also foster the development of our employees\u2019 expertise and skillsets, and encourage our employees to build new skill sets, such as in the ESG space.

You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below in this Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nWe are dependent on our tenants for our revenues. Our tenants face a wide range of business risks, including economic, competitive, government reimbursement and regulatory risks, any of which could cause our tenants to be unable to pay rent to us.\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u2022\nWe finance most of our portfolio with debt from our credit facility. We are subject to the risks associated with floating-rate debt, including the potential of an increase in our interest expense, borrowing capacity limitations and covenant restrictions.\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u2022\nOur assets are concentrated in healthcare-related facilities, making us more economically vulnerable to specific industry-related risks than if our assets were diversified across different industries.\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u2022\nThe inability of any of our significant tenants to pay rent to us could have a disproportionate negative affect on our business.\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u2022\nCompetition for medical office buildings has increased significantly since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u200b\n\u200b\n13\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nMost of our healthcare facilities are occupied by a single tenant, and we may have difficulty finding suitable replacement tenants in the event of a tenant default or non-renewal of our leases, especially for our healthcare facilities located in smaller markets.\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u2022\nOur and our tenants\u2019 businesses could be materially and adversely affected in the case of a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic or a new outbreak of a COVID-19 variant or a different virus.\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u2022\nWe have significant geographic concentration in a small number of states, including Texas, Florida, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Illinois. Economic and other conditions that negatively affect those states and our tenants in those states could have a greater effect on our revenues than if our properties were more geographically diverse.\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u2022\nWe rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs, and, if we encounter difficulty in obtaining such capital, we may not be able to make future acquisitions necessary to grow our business or meet maturing obligations.\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u2022\nSubject to certain requirements under Maryland law and REIT requirements, the Board has sole discretion to determine if we will pay distributions and the amount and frequency of such distributions, and past distribution amounts may not be indicative of future distribution amounts.\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u2022\nFailure to remain qualified as a REIT would cause us to be taxed as a regular corporation, which would substantially reduce funds available for distributions to our stockholders.\n\u200b\nRisks Related to our Business and Healthcare Facilities\n\u200b\nWe are dependent on our tenants for our revenues. Our tenants face a wide range of business risks, including economic, competitive, government reimbursement and regulatory risks, any of which could cause our tenants to be unable to pay rent to us.\nWe are dependent on our tenants for our revenues. Our tenants face a wide range of business risks, including economic, competitive, government reimbursement and regulatory risks, which may adversely affect their businesses and, in turn, their ability to pay rent to us. If any of our tenants were unable to pay their rent to us, our revenues and operating cash flows could be materially adversely affected, which in turn could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nOur assets are concentrated in healthcare-related facilities, making us more economically vulnerable to specific industry-related risks than if our assets were diversified across different industries.\nWe acquire and own healthcare-related facilities. We are subject to risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate, and specifically healthcare real estate. Any adverse effects that result from these risks could be more pronounced than if we diversified our investments outside of the healthcare industry. Any healthcare industry downturn could adversely affect the ability of our tenants to pay us rents and our ability to maintain current rental and occupancy rates. Our tenant mix could become even more concentrated if a significant portion of our tenants\u2019 practice in a particular medical field or are reliant upon a particular healthcare delivery system. Accordingly, a downturn in the healthcare industry generally, or a particular medical field or healthcare delivery system specifically, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nThe inability of any of our significant tenants to pay rent to us could have a disproportionate negative affect on our business.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, the annualized base rent from our top three tenants represented approximately 19% of our portfolio-wide annualized base rent, including our Kindred Healthcare facilities, which comprised approximately 7% of our annualized base rent; our Encompass facilities, which comprised approximately 7% of our annualized base rent; and our Memorial Health facilities, which comprised approximately 5% of our annualized base rent.\n14\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe have no control over the success or failure of our significant tenants\u2019 businesses, and, at any time, our significant tenants may fail to make rent payments when due, which, in turn, may have a disproportionate adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nCompetition for medical office buildings has increased significantly since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. \u00a0\nMedical office buildings were one of the few real estate asset classes that did not experience a significant downturn due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \u00a0Although many medical office building tenants did experience some business disruption during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many were able to weather those disruptions and return to normal operations within a short period of time. \u00a0This was not the case of many other types of real estate, such as hospitality, retail, and general commercial office buildings, which experienced significant tenant issues due to travel restrictions, changes in consumer habits during the pandemic and remote working policies instituted by many employers. \u00a0 \nThe resiliency of medical office buildings during the COVID-19 pandemic caused many real estate investors to enter the market in search of reliable returns. \u00a0This influx of investors has caused medical office building prices and competition to increase significantly, especially for Class A properties in prime locations, but has also caused similar increases in our target markets. \u00a0An increase in competition for our acquisition targets could make it more difficult to grow our business, which could affect our ability to increase our distributions and the trading price of our common and preferred stock. \u00a0\nOur and our tenants\u2019 business could be materially and adversely affected by the recent spread of the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus or in the case of a new outbreak of a COVID-19 variant or a different virus.\nThe rapid spread of the Omicron variant in late 2021 and the resulting increase in hospital admissions stressed the U.S. healthcare system, as more people sought treatment for COVID-19 infections and many healthcare workers became unavailable due to them having left the profession or being infected themselves. \u00a0Many stories exist about U.S. healthcare workers experiencing burnout due to the length and severity of the pandemic, and this has caused many healthcare workers to quit their professions. \u00a0If this continues, healthcare practices, including our tenants, may experience staffing shortages or increased labor and recruitment costs, which could negatively impact their businesses and their ability to pay rents to us. \u00a0Additionally, the volatility of COVID-19, as recently evidenced by the trajectory of the Omicron variant, is unpredictable and there are no assurances that an equally or more volatile variant will not emerge in the future. \u00a0\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, including the recent rise in cases due to the Omicron variant, could disrupt our and our third-party advisors\u2019 businesses.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken by applicable governmental authorities, we have been encouraging all of our employees at our corporate office to work remotely until further notice. While we believe these measures are advisable and in the best interests of our employees and communities, such measures, in combination with other factors, have caused disruptions to our normal operations and may continue to do so during the pendency of such measures. Additionally, certain of our service providers have instituted or may institute similar preventative measures or are experiencing labor shortages due to COVID-19, which has resulted in reductions in the availability, capacity and/or efficiency of the services upon which we depend for our operations, including the services we use to complete our property acquisitions. Further, in the event any of our employees, and/or employees of our service providers, contract COVID-19 or are otherwise compelled to self-quarantine, we may experience shortages in labor and services that we require for our operations. Also, remote work arrangements may increase the risk of cybersecurity incidents, data breaches or cyber-attacks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, due to, among other things, the loss of proprietary data, interruptions or delays in the operation of our business and damage to our reputation.\nOur leases are generally long-term leases with annual rent escalators, however, some of our debt financing is subject to floating interest rates. An increase in interest rates may not be matched by an increase in our rent payments, which could expose us to a funding imbalance.\nOur revenues are generated by our leases, which are typically medium-to-long-term leases with fixed rental rates, subject to annual rent escalators. The unhedged portion of our Credit Facility debt is subject to LIBOR. The generally fixed nature of revenues and the variable rate of our debt obligations create interest rate risk for us. Increases in interest rates may not be matched by increases \n15\n\n\nTable of Contents\nin our rental income, which could increase our expenses and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nThe bankruptcy of any of our tenants could bar our efforts to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from the tenant or evict the tenant and take back control of the property.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have had one tenant file for bankruptcy. Any bankruptcy filings by or relating to one of our tenants could bar all efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from that tenant or evict the tenant and take back control of the property, unless we receive an order permitting us to do so from a bankruptcy court, which we may be unable to obtain. A tenant bankruptcy could also delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude full collection of these sums. If a tenant rejects the lease while in bankruptcy, we would have only a general unsecured claim for pre-petition damages. Any unsecured claim that we hold may be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same\u00a0percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims. It is possible that we may recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims that we hold, or nothing at all, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common stock and preferred stock. Furthermore, dealing with a tenant bankruptcy or other default may divert management\u2019s attention and cause us to incur substantial legal and other costs.\nThe physical effects of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our properties.\n\u200b\nThe physical effects of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our facilities, operations, and business. To the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns, markets where our properties are located could experience increases in storm intensity, rising sea-levels, and changes in precipitation, temperature, and air quality. Over time, these conditions could result in physical damage to, or declining demand for, our properties or our inability to operate the facilities at all. Climate change may also indirectly affect our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable, increasing the cost of energy and increasing the risk of flood at our properties. Should the impact of climate change be severe or occur for lengthy periods of time, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock could be materially adversely impacted.\nAdverse economic or other conditions in our geographic markets could negatively affect our tenants\u2019 ability to pay rent to us.\nAdverse economic or other conditions in our geographic markets, including periods of economic slowdown or recession, industry slowdowns, periods of deflation, relocation of businesses, changing demographics, earthquakes and other natural disasters, fires, terrorist acts, public health crisis, pandemics and epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and civil disturbances or acts of war and other man-made disasters which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses, and changes in tax, real estate, zoning and other laws and regulations, may negatively affect our tenants\u2019 businesses and ability to pay rents to us and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nMost of our healthcare facilities are occupied by a single tenant, and we may have difficulty finding suitable replacement tenants in the event of a tenant default or non-renewal of our leases, especially for our healthcare facilities located in smaller markets.\nAs of December 31, 2021, leases representing 1.5%, 6.2% and 16.2% of our portfolio annualized base rent expire in 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively. \u00a0Most of our healthcare facilities are occupied by a single tenant. Following expiration of a lease term or if we exercise our right to replace a tenant in default, rental payments on the related healthcare facilities could decline or cease altogether while we reposition such healthcare facility with a suitable replacement tenant. We also might not be successful in identifying suitable replacement tenants or entering into triple-net leases with new tenants on a timely basis, on favorable terms, or at all. Additionally, we may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of, and avoid the imposition of liens on, our healthcare facilities while they are being repositioned. Our ability to reposition our healthcare facilities with a suitable tenant could be significantly delayed or limited by state licensing, receivership, CON or other laws, as well as by the Medicare and Medicaid change-of-ownership rules. We could also incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings. In addition, our ability to locate suitable replacement tenants could be impaired by the specialized healthcare uses or contractual restrictions on use of the healthcare facilities, and we may be required to spend substantial amounts to adapt the healthcare facilities to other uses. Any such delays, limitations and expenses could adversely impact our ability to collect rent, obtain possession of leased healthcare facilities or otherwise exercise remedies for tenant default, \n16\n\n\nTable of Contents\nwhich, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nAll of these risks may be greater in smaller markets, where there may be fewer potential replacement tenants, making it more difficult to replace tenants, especially for specialized space.\nWe have significant geographic concentration in a small number of states, including Texas, Florida, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Illinois. Economic and other conditions that negatively affect those states and our tenants in those states could have a greater effect on our revenues than if our properties were more geographically diverse.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, approximately\u00a019%, 11%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 6% and 6% of our total annualized base rent was derived from properties located in \nTexas, Florida, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Illinois\n, respectively.\u00a0As a result of this geographic concentration, we are particularly exposed to downturns in these states\u2019 economies or other changes in local real estate market conditions. Any material changes in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in these states could have an amplified effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock than if our properties were more geographically diverse.\nWe may be unable to successfully enter into definitive purchase or sale agreements for, or close the acquisition or sale of, the properties in our investment pipeline or our portfolio.\nThere is no assurance that we will successfully enter into definitive purchase agreements for the facilities in our investment pipeline or definitive sale agreements for current properties we wish to sell. We or a counterparty could also determine through due diligence that a prospective facility does not meet our or their investment standards. We also may be unable to come to an agreement with the seller or buyer for the purchase or sale of the facility. Additionally, there is no assurance that we will successfully close an acquisition or sale once a purchase or sale agreement has been signed. After a purchase or sale agreement has been signed, we (or the buyer in the case of a sale transaction) typically have a due diligence period of 45 to 60\u00a0days. If we or a buyer identify problems with the property or the operator during our or their due diligence review, we may or they may terminate the purchase or sale agreement and not close. Failure to close acquisitions or dispositions under contract could make it more difficult to grow or manage our portfolio, which could materially adversely affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nWe may obtain only limited warranties when we purchase a property, which, in turn, would only provide us with limited recourse against the seller if issues arise after our purchase of a property.\nThe seller of a property often sells such property in its \u201cas is\u201d condition on a \u201cwhere is\u201d basis and \u201cwith all faults,\u201d without any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular use or purpose. In addition, purchase and sale agreements may contain only limited warranties, representations and indemnifications that will only survive for a limited period after the closing. The purchase of properties with limited warranties increases the risk of having little or no recourse against a seller if issues were to arise at such property. This, in turn, could cause us to have to write off our investment in the property, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nOur healthcare buildings that are subject to ground leases could restrict our use of such healthcare facilities.\nWe have seven buildings located on land that is subject to operating ground leases, representing approximately 4.5% of our December\u00a02021 annualized base rent. These ground leases contain certain restrictions. These restrictions include limits on our ability to re-let the facilities, rights of purchase and rights of first offer and refusal with respect to sales of the healthcare facility and limits on the types of medical procedures that may be performed at the facilities. These restrictions could affect our returns on these facilities which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\n17\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur healthcare facilities and our tenants may be unable to compete successfully, which could negatively affect our tenants\u2019 businesses and ability to pay rent to us.\nOur healthcare facilities often face competition from nearby hospitals and other healthcare facilities that provide comparable services, including urgent care and primary care facilities as well as home healthcare companies. These competitors may have greater geographic coverage, better access to physicians and patients and provide or are perceived to provide higher quality services. From time to time and for reasons beyond our control, managed care organizations may change their lists of preferred hospitals or in-network physicians, which may favor our tenants\u2019 competitors. Furthermore, our tenants may lose physicians to their competitors or an increase in telehealth services could reduce the need for healthcare facilities. Any reduction in rental revenues resulting from the inability of our tenants or their associated healthcare delivery systems to compete or due to a reduced need for healthcare facilities generally may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nWe may incur uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage, which may result in us having to absorb all or a portion of such loss.\nOur tenants are generally required (either directly or through a reimbursement arrangement with us) to maintain comprehensive property and casualty insurance covering our properties. However, some types of losses may be uninsurable or too expensive to insure against, such as losses due to windstorms, terrorist acts, earthquakes, and toxic mold. Accordingly, we may not have enough insurance coverage against certain types of losses and may experience decreases in the insurance coverage available. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose all or a portion of our investment in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. In such an event, we might remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligation related to the property. Further, if any of our insurance carriers were to become insolvent, we would be forced to replace the existing coverage with another suitable carrier, and any outstanding claims would be at risk for collection. In such an event, we cannot be certain that we would be able to replace the coverage at similar or otherwise favorable terms.\nWe have obtained title insurance policies for each of our properties, typically in an amount equal to its original price. However, these policies may be for amounts less than the current or future values of our properties. In such an event, if there is a title defect relating to any of our properties, we could lose some of our investment in and anticipated profits from such property.\nIf we were to experience uninsured losses or if any of our insurance carriers were unable to pay insurance claims, we may lose all or a portion of our investment in a property and the revenues associated with such property, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nWe may incur environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with owning, leasing, developing and operating our healthcare facilities.\nUnder various U.S. federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, current and prior owners and tenants of healthcare facilities may be jointly and severally liable for the costs of investigating, remediating and monitoring certain hazardous substances or other regulated materials on or in such healthcare facility. In addition to these costs, the past or present owner or tenant of a healthcare facility from which a release emanates could be liable for any personal injury or property damage that results from such releases, including for the unauthorized release of asbestos-containing materials and other hazardous substances into the air, as well as any damages to natural resources or the environment that arise from such releases. These environmental laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the current or prior owner or tenant knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or release of such substances or materials. Moreover, the release of hazardous substances or materials, or the failure to properly remediate such substances or materials, may adversely affect the owner\u2019s or tenant\u2019s ability to lease, sell, develop or rent such healthcare facility or to borrow against such healthcare facility. Persons who transport or arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances or other regulated materials may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility, regardless of whether such facility is owned or operated by such person.\nCertain environmental laws impose compliance obligations on owners and tenants of real property with respect to the management of hazardous substances and other regulated materials. For example, environmental laws govern the management and removal of asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint. Failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties or other \n18\n\n\nTable of Contents\nsanctions. If we are held liable under these laws, our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock may be materially adversely affected.\nThe income from certain of our properties is dependent on the ability of our property managers to successfully manage those properties.\nWe depend upon the performance of our property managers to effectively manage certain of our properties. We do not control these third-party property managers and are accordingly subject to various risks generally associated with outsourcing of management of day-to-day activities, including the risk that a property manager may not be able to successfully manage a property. Additionally, because we do not control our third-party property managers, any adverse events such as issues related to insufficient internal controls, cybersecurity incidents or other adverse events may impact the income we recognize from properties managed by such third-party property managers. We may be unable to anticipate such events or properly assess the magnitude of any such events because we do not control our third-party property managers. If our property managers are unable to successfully manage our properties, our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock may be materially adversely affected.\nWe, our tenants, and our property managers face risks associated with security breaches through cyber-attacks, cyber-intrusions, or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of information technology networks and related systems.\nWe and our tenants face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions over the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to emails, company insiders, or persons with access to our and our tenants\u2019 systems, and other significant disruptions of our and our tenants\u2019 information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) networks and related systems. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber-intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber-terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Our and our tenants\u2019 IT networks and related systems are essential to the operation of each of our businesses and our and our tenants\u2019 ability to perform day-to-day operations (including maintaining confidential patient data). Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that these security measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Additionally, our tenants may not have enough risk mitigation measures in place or, even if they do, such measures may not be effective. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems, and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and may not be detected. Accordingly, we and our tenants may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and it is therefore impossible to entirely mitigate the risk.\nA security breach or other significant disruption involving our or our tenants\u2019 IT networks and related systems could:\n\u25cf\nDisrupt the proper functioning of our or our tenants\u2019 networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of our tenants;\n\u25cf\nResult in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive, or otherwise valuable information about us, our tenants or our tenants\u2019 patients, which others could use to compete against us or our tenants or which could expose us or our tenants to regulatory action or damage claims by third-parties;\n\u25cf\nResult in misstated financial reports, violations of loan covenants, missed reporting deadlines, and/or missed permitting deadlines;\n\u25cf\nResult in our inability to properly monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations regarding our qualification as a REIT;\n\u25cf\njeopardize the building systems relied upon by our tenants for the efficient use of their leased space;\n\u25cf\nRequire significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result;\n19\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u25cf\nSubject us or our tenants to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, penalties, or termination of leases or other agreements; or\n\u25cf\nDamage our and our tenants\u2019 reputations.\nAny or all the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nRisks Related to our Financings\nWe finance most of our portfolio with debt from our credit facility. We are subject to the risks associated with floating-rate debt, including the potential of an increase in our interest expense, borrowing capacity limitations, and covenant restrictions.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, our total outstanding debt, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, was $571.7 million, of which $514.6 million was debt from our amended and restated credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d). We expect interest rates to rise during 2022 and, if interest rates do rise, or the interest rate spread on our Credit Facility increases based on our consolidated leverage ratios, our borrowing costs would increase, which could, among other things, increase our cost of capital (which would affect our ability to acquire assets) and decrease our earnings, liquidity, cash available to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nSince our IPO, we have grown our healthcare portfolio significantly. In order to continue growing our portfolio and maintain appropriate leverage levels, we require access to both debt and equity capital. The $400 million revolver component (the \u201cRevolver\u201d) of our Credit Facility is the primary source of our acquisition funding, and we primarily rely on equity capital to reduce the balance of the Revolver to provide capacity for continued acquisitions. As of February 25, 2022, we had unutilized borrowing capacity under the Revolver of approximately $222.5 million. If we are unable to increase our debt capacity or raise equity to reduce the balance of our Revolver, our growth prospects may be negatively affected. \nThe terms of our debt agreements require us to comply with several customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining certain leverage and coverage ratios and minimum tangible net worth requirements. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u00a0\u2013 Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for a description of these covenants. Our continued ability to incur additional debt, make distributions and conduct business in general is subject to our compliance with these covenants, which limit our operational flexibility. Breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness, in addition to any other indebtedness cross-defaulted against such instruments, which could accelerate the principal balance of our debt and cause our lenders to institute foreclosure proceedings against us. Therefore, any such default could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nOur interest rate hedges may not be successful in mitigating our interest rate risks.\nWe use derivative instruments to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates on certain of our variable rate loans. As of December\u00a031, 2021, we had 11 interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $350 million that fixed the LIBOR component of the interest rate on the Term Loan. There is no assurance that our hedging instruments will adequately mitigate our interest rate risk or that our hedging strategy will not result in losses. Additionally, a hedging counterparty may fail to honor its obligations to us. If our interest rate hedges are unsuccessful in mitigating our interest rate risk, or if a hedging counterparty fails to honor its obligations to us, our borrowing costs would increase, which could, among other things, increase our cost of capital and decrease our earnings, liquidity, cash available to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock. \u00a0See \n\u201c\u2014The phasing out of LIBOR may affect our interest expense and ability to hedge our interest rate risk\n,\u201d for a description of risks to our hedging instruments related to the phasing out of LIBOR.\nWe finance our healthcare facilities with term indebtedness, and we may place term indebtedness on our healthcare facilities in the future. We may not be able to refinance such debt when due or may be unable to refinance such debt on favorable terms.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, we had $571.7 million of indebtedness outstanding (net of unamortized debt issuance costs). We may also place indebtedness on our healthcare facilities in the future. We run the risk of being unable to refinance such debt (including \n20\n\n\nTable of Contents\nour Credit Facility debt) when the loans come due or of being unable to refinance on favorable terms. If interest rates are higher when we refinance debt, our income could be reduced. We may be unable to refinance debt at appropriate times, which may require us to sell healthcare facilities on terms that are not advantageous to us or could result in the foreclosure of such healthcare facilities. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nThe phasing out of LIBOR\u00a0may affect our interest expense and ability to hedge our interest rate risk.\nIn July\u00a02017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, announced its intention to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. As a result, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d) which identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its preferred alternative to LIBOR in derivatives and other financial contracts. ICE Benchmark Administration (\u201cIBA\u201d), the administrator of LIBOR, plans to cease publication for all USD LIBOR tenors (except the one- and two-week tenors, which ceased on December 31, 2021) on June 30, 2023. The Credit Facility provides that, on or about the LIBOR cessation date (subject to an early opt-in election), LIBOR shall be replaced as a benchmark rate in the Credit Facility with term SOFR (or another alternative rate if term SOFR is not able to be determined), with such adjustments to cause the new benchmark rate to be economically equivalent to LIBOR at the time of the LIBOR cessation date. \u00a0\nAfter the LIBOR cessation date, we will not know if SOFR will fluctuate in the same manner as LIBOR once did, or if our interest expense would have been lower if LIBOR continued to be our reference rate. \u00a0Given the uncertainty as to how SOFR will fluctuate as the new reference rate, we may experience higher interest expense than if LIBOR had remained the reference rate. \u00a0While the Company expects LIBOR to be available in substantially its current form until at least June 30, 2023, it is possible that LIBOR will become unavailable prior to that point. \u00a0This could result, for example, if sufficient banks decline to make submissions to the IBA. \u00a0In that case, the risks associated with the transition to an alternative reference rate would be accelerated and magnified. \u00a0\nThe Company has interest rate swap agreements that are indexed to LIBOR and it will need to enter into bilateral agreements with its swap counterparties to institute a fallback reference rate once LIBOR ceases to be published. It is expected that most market participants will transition to compounding SOFR as the new reference rate for derivative contracts. If the Company transitions its interest rate swaps to compounded SOFR, such transition may impact the effectiveness of its hedging instruments as the expected reference rate for its Credit Facility (term SOFR) will be different than the reference rate for its interest rate swaps (compounded SOFR). \u00a0\nIf term SOFR (the expected post-LIBOR reference rate for our Credit Facility loans) and compound SOFR (the expected post-LIBOR reference for our interest hedges) vary significantly, our hedging instruments may lose their effectiveness, which may increase our interest expense and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nWe rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs, and, if we encounter difficulty in obtaining such capital, we may not be able to make future acquisitions necessary to grow our business or meet maturing obligations.\nTo qualify as a REIT, we are required, among other things, to distribute each\u00a0year to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain. Because of this distribution requirement, we may not be able to fund our future capital needs from cash retained from operations, including capital needed to make investments and to satisfy or refinance maturing obligations. As a result, we expect to rely on external sources of capital, including debt and equity financing, to fund future capital needs. Our access to capital will depend upon several factors, many of which we have little or no control, including:\n\u25cf\nThe extent of investor interest;\n\u25cf\nOur ability to satisfy the distribution requirements applicable to REITs;\n\u25cf\nThe general reputation of REITs and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate-based companies;\n\u25cf\nOur financial performance and that of our tenants;\n21\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u25cf\nAnalyst reports about us and the REIT industry;\n\u25cf\nGeneral stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, which may lead prospective purchasers of our stock to demand a higher annual yield from future distributions;\n\u25cf\nA failure to maintain or increase our dividend which is dependent, in large part, upon our funds from operations, or FFO, which, in turn, depends upon increased revenue from additional acquisitions and rental increases; and\n\u25cf\nOther factors such as governmental regulatory action and changes in REIT tax laws.\nIf we are unable to obtain needed capital on satisfactory terms or at all, we may not be able to make the investments needed to expand our business or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature, which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nRisks Related to the Healthcare Industry\nAdverse trends in the healthcare industry may negatively affect our tenants\u2019 businesses.\nThe healthcare industry is currently experiencing, among other things:\n\u25cf\nChanges in the demand for and methods of delivering healthcare services;\n\u25cf\nCompetition among healthcare providers;\n\u25cf\nConsolidation of large health insurers;\n\u25cf\nRegulatory and government reimbursement uncertainty resulting from the Affordable Care Act and other healthcare reform laws;\n\u25cf\nFederal court decisions on cases challenging the legality of the Affordable Care Act;\n\u25cf\nFederal and state government plans to reduce budget deficits and address debt ceiling limits by lowering healthcare provider Medicare and Medicaid payment rates;\n\u25cf\nChanges in third-party reimbursement methods and policies; and\n\u25cf\nIncreased scrutiny of billing, referral and other practices by U.S. federal and state authorities.\nThese factors may adversely affect the economic performance of some or all of our tenants and, in turn, our lease revenues, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nThe healthcare industry is heavily regulated, and new laws or regulations, changes to existing laws or regulations, loss of licensure or failure to obtain licensure could result in the inability of our tenants to make rent payments to us.\nThe healthcare industry is heavily regulated by U.S. federal, state, and local governmental authorities. Our tenants generally are subject to laws and regulations covering, among other things, licensure, certification for participation in government programs, billing for services, privacy and security of health information and relationships with physicians and other referral sources. See \u201cBusiness\u2013Government Programs, Laws and Regulations\u201d for a description of the laws and regulations that affect the healthcare industry. In addition, new laws and regulations, changes in existing laws and regulations or changes in the interpretation of such laws or regulations could affect our tenants\u2019 ability to make rent payments to us, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock. These changes, in some cases, could apply retroactively. The enactment, timing, or effect of legislative or regulatory changes cannot be predicted.\n22\n\n\nTable of Contents\nViolations of healthcare laws may result in criminal and/or civil penalties that range from punitive sanctions, damage assessments, penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments and/or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Imposition of any of these penalties upon one of our tenants could jeopardize that tenants\u2019 ability to operate or to make rent payments or affect the level of occupancy in our healthcare facilities, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nReductions in reimbursement from third-party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, could adversely affect the profitability of our tenants and hinder their ability to make rent payments to us or renew their leases.\nSources of revenue for our tenants typically include the U.S. federal Medicare program, state Medicaid programs and private insurance payors. Healthcare providers continue to face increased government and private payor pressure to control or reduce healthcare costs and significant reductions in healthcare reimbursement, including reduced reimbursements and changes to payment methodologies under the Affordable Care Act. In some cases, private insurers rely on all or portions of the Medicare payment systems to determine payment rates, which may result in decreased reimbursement from private insurers. Any reductions in payments or reimbursements from third-party payors could adversely affect the reimbursement rates received by our tenants, the financial success of our tenants and strategic partners and, therefore, our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nDownturns in the United States economy could negatively affect state budgets, thereby putting pressure on states to decrease spending on state programs including Medicaid. The need to control Medicaid expenditures may be exacerbated by the potential for increased enrollment in state Medicaid programs due to unemployment and declines in family incomes. Historically, states have often attempted to reduce Medicaid spending by limiting benefits and tightening Medicaid eligibility requirements. Many states have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, legislation designed to enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care programs and/or impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand the states\u2019 Medicaid systems. Potential reductions to Medicaid program spending in response to state budgetary pressures could negatively impact the ability of our tenants to successfully operate their businesses, and, consequently, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nOur tenants may be subject to significant legal actions that could subject them to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities, which may affect their ability to pay their rent payments to us, and we could also be subject to healthcare industry violations.\nAs is typical in the healthcare industry, our tenants may often become subject to claims that their services have resulted in patient injury or other adverse effects. Many of these tenants may have experienced an increasing trend in the frequency and severity of professional liability and general liability insurance claims and litigation asserted against them. The insurance coverage maintained by these tenants may not cover all claims made against them nor continue to be available at a reasonable cost, if at all. In some states, insurance coverage for the risk of punitive damages arising from professional liability and general liability claims and/or litigation may not, in certain cases, be available to these tenants due to state law prohibitions or limitations of availability. As a result, these types of tenants of our healthcare facilities operating in these states may be liable for punitive damage awards that are either not covered or are in excess of their insurance policy limits.\nWe also believe that there has been, and will continue to be, an increase in governmental investigations of certain healthcare providers, particularly in the area of Medicare/Medicaid false claims, as well as an increase in enforcement actions resulting from these investigations. Insurance is not available to cover such losses. Any adverse determination in a legal proceeding or governmental investigation, any settlements of such proceedings or investigations in excess of insurance coverage, whether currently asserted or arising in the future, could have a material adverse effect on a tenant\u2019s financial condition. If a tenant is unable to obtain or maintain insurance coverage, if judgments are obtained or settlements reached in excess of the insurance coverage, if a tenant is required to pay uninsured punitive damages, or if a tenant is subject to an uninsurable government enforcement action or investigation, the tenant could be exposed to substantial additional liabilities, which may affect the tenant\u2019s ability to pay rent, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\n23\n\n\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to the Real Estate Industry\nChanges in the general real estate market conditions may adversely affect us.\nReal estate investments are subject to various risks and fluctuations and cycles in value and demand, many of which are beyond our control. Certain market conditions that may affect our business are as follows:\n\u25cf\nNational or regional economic upturns could increase the value of real estate generally, which could make it more difficult for us to acquire new healthcare properties at attractive prices or prevent us from purchasing additional facilities at all;\n\u25cf\nNational or regional economic downturns could adversely affect our tenants\u2019 businesses, or the businesses located in our tenants\u2019 geographic region, which could adversely affect our tenants\u2019 ability to pay rent and the value of our healthcare properties;\n\u25cf\nA decrease in interest rates and financing costs could increase demand for real estate and, thus, the price of real estate. An increase in demand for real estate could make it more difficult for us to acquire additional healthcare facilities at attractive prices or prevent us from purchasing additional facilities at all; and\n\u25cf\nAn increase in interest rates and financing costs could decrease the demand for real estate and, thus, the price of real estate. A decrease in demand for real estate could make it more difficult for us to dispose of our healthcare facilities at attractive prices or prevent us from disposing of our facilities at all.\nIf we experience one or more of the risks described above, our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock could be materially adversely affected.\nIlliquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our healthcare facilities.\nBecause real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to promptly sell one or more of our healthcare facilities in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions is limited. The real estate market is affected by many factors, such as general economic conditions, availability of financing, interest rates and other factors, including supply and demand, that are beyond our control. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any of our healthcare facilities for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of any of our healthcare facilities. We may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a healthcare facility can be sold. We cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements.\nIn acquiring a healthcare facility, we have in the past and may in the future agree to transfer restrictions that materially restrict us from selling that healthcare facility for a period of time or impose other restrictions, such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that healthcare facility. These transfer restrictions would impede our ability to sell a healthcare facility even if we deem it necessary or appropriate. These facts and any others that would impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our healthcare facilities may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nUncertain market conditions could cause us to sell our healthcare facilities at a loss in the future.\nWe intend to hold our various real estate investments until we determine that a sale or other disposition appears to be advantageous to achieve our investment objectives. We may exercise our discretion as to whether and when to sell a healthcare facility,\n\u00a0\nand we have no obligation to sell our facilities. We generally intend to hold our healthcare facilities for an extended period, and we cannot predict with any certainty the various market conditions affecting real estate investments that will exist at any particular time in the future. Because of the uncertainty of market conditions that may affect the future disposition of our healthcare facilities, we may not be able to sell our buildings at a profit in the future or at all. We may incur prepayment penalties if we sell a healthcare facility subject to a mortgage earlier than we otherwise had planned. Additionally, we could be forced to sell healthcare facilities at inopportune times which could result in us selling the affected building at a substantial loss. Any inability to sell a healthcare facility could materially, \n24\n\n\nTable of Contents\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nOur assets may become subject to impairment charges.\nWe periodically evaluate our real estate investments and other assets for impairment indicators. The judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based upon factors such as market conditions, lease re-negotiations, tenant performance and legal structure. For example, the termination of a lease by a major tenant may lead to an impairment charge. If we determine that an impairment has occurred, we would be required to make an adjustment to the net carrying value of the asset which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nRisks Related to Our Structure\nWe have no direct operations and rely on funds received from our Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries to meet our obligations.\nWe conduct substantially all of our operations through our Operating Partnership. As of December\u00a031, 2021, we owned 94.35% of the outstanding OP Units. Apart from this ownership interest in our Operating Partnership, we do not have any independent operations. As a result, we rely on distributions from our Operating Partnership to pay any dividends that we might declare on our common and preferred stock. We also rely on distributions from our Operating Partnership to meet our obligations. Stockholders\u2019 claims will consequently be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations (whether or not for borrowed money)\u00a0of our Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. Therefore, in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, claims of our stockholders will be satisfied only after all of our and our Operating Partnership\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 liabilities and obligations have been paid in full.\n\u00a0\nIf we do not receive enough funds from our Operating Partnership, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock may be materially, adversely affected.\nSubject to certain requirements under Maryland law and REIT requirements, the Board has sole discretion to determine if we will pay distributions and the amount and frequency of such distributions, and past distribution amounts may not be indicative of future distribution amounts.\nAny future distributions will be at the sole discretion of the Board and will depend upon a number of factors, including our actual and projected results of operations, the cash flow generated by our operations, funds from operations (\u201cFFO\u201d), adjusted FFO (\u201cAFFO\u201d), liquidity, our operating expenses, our debt service requirements, capital expenditure requirements for the properties in our portfolio, prohibitions and other limitations under our financing arrangements, our REIT taxable income, the annual REIT distribution requirements, restrictions on making distributions under Maryland law and such other factors as the Board deems relevant. We cannot assure you that our distribution policy will not change in the future or that the Board will continue to declare dividends at the same rate as in 2021.\nOur use of OP Units as currency to acquire healthcare facilities could result in stockholder dilution and/or limit our ability to sell such healthcare facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe have acquired, and in the future may acquire, healthcare facilities or portfolios of healthcare facilities through tax-deferred contribution transactions in exchange for OP Units, which may result in stockholder dilution. This acquisition structure may have the effect of, among other things, reducing the amount of tax depreciation we could deduct over the tax life of the acquired healthcare facilities, and has required, and may in the future require, that we agree to protect the contributors\u2019 ability to defer recognition of taxable gain through restrictions on our ability to dispose of the acquired healthcare facilities or the allocation of partnership debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases. These restrictions could limit our ability to sell healthcare facilities at a time, or on terms, that would be favorable absent such restrictions which, in turn, could materially, adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\n25\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur Operating Partnership may issue additional OP Units to third parties without the consent of our stockholders, which would reduce our ownership\u00a0percentage in our Operating Partnership and could have a dilutive effect on the amount of distributions made to us by our Operating Partnership and, therefore, the amount of distributions we can make to our stockholders.\nHolders of shares of our common stock will generally not have any voting rights with respect to activities of our Operating Partnership, including issuances of additional OP Units in amounts that do not exceed 20% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As of December\u00a031, 2021, we owned 94.35% of the outstanding OP Units. Our Operating Partnership may, in connection with our acquisition of healthcare facilities or otherwise, issue additional OP Units to third parties. Such issuances would reduce our ownership\u00a0percentage in our Operating Partnership and could affect the amount of distributions made to us by our Operating Partnership and, therefore, the amount of distributions we can make to our stockholders.\nWe may be unable to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting.\nPursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to provide a report by management on internal controls over financial reporting, including management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of such controls. Because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud, effective internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls as a result of changes to our business or otherwise, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, results of operations and financial condition, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock could be materially adversely impacted and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nConflicts of interest could arise because of our UPREIT structure.\nConflicts of interest could arise because of the relationships between us and our affiliates, on the one hand, and our Operating Partnership or any partner thereof, on the other. Our directors and officers have duties to us under applicable Maryland law in connection with their management of our company. At the same time, we, as the sole member of the general partner of the Operating Partnership, have fiduciary duties to our Operating Partnership and to the limited partners under Delaware law in connection with the management of our Operating Partnership. Our duties, as the sole member of the general partner, to our Operating Partnership and its limited partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to us.\nUnless otherwise provided for in the relevant partnership agreement, Delaware law generally requires a general partner of a Delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith, fairness and loyalty and which generally prohibits such general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest.\nAdditionally, the partnership agreement expressly limits our liability by providing that we, as the sole member of the general partner of the Operating Partnership, and our directors or officers, will not be liable or accountable in damages to our Operating Partnership, the limited partners or assignees for errors in judgment, mistakes of fact or law or for any act or omission if the general partner or such director or officer acted in good faith. In addition, our Operating Partnership is required to indemnify us, our affiliates and each of our respective officers and directors, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities (whether joint or several), expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys\u2019 fees and other legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, that relate to the operations of our Operating Partnership, provided that our Operating Partnership will not indemnify any such person for (1)\u00a0acts or omissions committed in bad faith or that were the result of active and deliberate dishonesty, (2)\u00a0any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in money, healthcare facility or services, or (3)\u00a0in the case of a criminal proceeding, the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful.\nOur charter restricts the ownership and transfer of our outstanding shares of stock which may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or change of control of our company.\nFor us to qualify as a REIT, no more than 50% of the value of our outstanding shares of stock may be owned, beneficially or constructively, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of each taxable\u00a0year other than our initial REIT taxable\u00a0year. \n26\n\n\nTable of Contents\nSubject to certain exceptions, our charter prohibits any stockholder from owning actually or constructively more than 9.8% in value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of any class or series of our outstanding shares. The constructive ownership rules\u00a0under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), are complex and may cause the outstanding shares owned by a group of related individuals or entities to be deemed to be constructively owned by one individual or entity. As a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8% of our outstanding shares of any class or series by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity to own constructively in excess of 9.8% of any class or series of our outstanding beneficial interests and to be subject to our charter\u2019s ownership limit. Our charter also prohibits any person from owning shares of our beneficial interests that would result in our being \u201cclosely held\u201d under Section\u00a0856(h)\u00a0of the Code or otherwise cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT. Any attempt to own or transfer shares of our beneficial interest in violation of these restrictions may result in the shares being automatically transferred to a charitable trust or may be void.\nCertain provisions of Maryland law could inhibit changes of control, which may discourage third parties from conducting a tender offer or seeking other change of control transactions that could involve a premium price for shares of our common stock or that our stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interests.\nCertain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law, or MGCL, may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could provide our common stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of such shares, including:\n\u25cf\n\u201cbusiness combination\u201d provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between us and an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of our shares of common stock or an affiliate thereof or an affiliate or associate of ours who was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of the voting power of our shares of common stock at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date in question) for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter imposes certain fair price and/or supermajority and stockholder voting requirements on these combinations; and\n\u25cf\n\u201ccontrol share\u201d provisions that provide that holders of \u201ccontrol shares\u201d of our company (defined as shares that, when aggregated with other shares controlled by the stockholder, entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a \u201ccontrol share acquisition\u201d (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of issued and outstanding \u201ccontrol shares\u201d) have no voting rights with respect to their control shares, except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares.\nBy resolution of the Board, we have opted out of the business combination provisions of the MGCL and provide that any business combination between us and any other person is exempt from the business combination provisions of the MGCL, provided that the business combination is first approved by the Board (including a majority of directors who are not affiliates or associates of such persons). In addition, pursuant to a provision in our bylaws, we have opted out of the control share provisions of the MGCL. However, the Board may by resolution elect to opt into the business combination provisions of the MGCL and we may, by amendment to our bylaws, opt into the control share provisions of the MGCL in the future.\nCertain provisions of the MGCL permit the Board, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to implement certain corporate governance provisions, some of which (for example, a classified board) are not currently applicable to us. If implemented, these provisions may have the effect of limiting or precluding a third party from making an unsolicited acquisition proposal for us or of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control of us under circumstances that otherwise could provide our common stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price. Our charter contains a provision whereby we have elected to be subject to the provisions of Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the MGCL relating to the filling of vacancies on the Board.\n27\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe could increase the number of authorized shares of common and preferred stock, classify and reclassify unissued shares and issue shares without stockholder approval.\nThe Board, without stockholder approval, has the power under our charter to amend our charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares or the number of shares of any class or series that we are authorized to issue, to authorize us to issue authorized but unissued shares of our common stock or preferred stock. In addition, under our charter, the Board has the power to classify or reclassify any unissued common or preferred stock into one or more classes or series of shares and set the preference, conversion, or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends and other distributions, qualifications or terms or conditions of redemption for such newly classified or reclassified shares. As a result, we may issue series or classes of common or preferred stock with preferences, dividends, powers and rights, voting or otherwise, that are senior to, or otherwise conflict with, the rights of holders of our common or preferred stock. Although the Board has no such intention at the present time, it could establish a class or series of preferred stock that could, depending on the terms of such series, delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for shares of our common stock or that our stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interests.\nWe may change our business, investment, and financing strategies without stockholder approval.\nWe may change our business, investment, and financing strategies without a vote of, or notice to, our stockholders, which could result in our making investments and engaging in business activities that are different from, and possibly riskier than, the investments and businesses described in this annual report. In particular, a change in our investment strategy, including the manner in which we allocate our resources across our portfolio or the types of assets in which we seek to invest, may increase our exposure to real estate market fluctuations. In addition, we may in the future increase the use of leverage at times and in amounts that we, in our discretion, deem prudent, and such decision would not be subject to stockholder approval. Furthermore, the Board may determine that healthcare facilities do not offer the potential for attractive risk-adjusted returns for an investment strategy. Changes to our strategies with regards to the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nOur rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited, which could limit your recourse in the event that we take certain actions which are not in your best interests.\nUnder Maryland law, generally, directors and officers are required to perform their duties in good faith, in a manner that they reasonably believe to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. Under Maryland law, directors and officers are presumed to have acted with this standard of care. Maryland law permits a Maryland corporation to include in its charter a provision limiting the liability of its directors and officers to the corporation and its stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from (a)\u00a0actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property, or services or (b)\u00a0active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action. Our charter contains such a provision which eliminates directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law.\nOur charter authorizes us to indemnify our present and former directors and officers for actions taken by them in those and other capacities to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. Our bylaws obligate us to indemnify each present and former director or officer, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law, in the defense of any proceeding to which he or she is made, or threatened to be made, a party by reason of his or her service to us. In addition, we may be obligated to advance the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers. We have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and officers granting them express indemnification rights. As a result, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist absent the current provisions in our charter, bylaws and indemnification agreements or that might exist with other companies.\nOur charter contains provisions that make removal of our directors difficult, which could make it difficult for our stockholders to effect changes to our management and may prevent a change in control of our company that is in the best interests of our stockholders. Our charter provides that a director may only be removed for cause upon the affirmative vote of holders of two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors. Vacancies may be filled only by a majority of the remaining directors in office, even if less than a quorum. These requirements make it more difficult to change our management by removing and replacing directors and may prevent a change in control of our company that is in the best interests of our stockholders.\n28\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCertain provisions in the partnership agreement of our Operating Partnership may delay or prevent unsolicited acquisitions of us.\nProvisions in the partnership agreement of our Operating Partnership may delay, or make more difficult, unsolicited acquisitions of us or changes of our control. These provisions could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an unsolicited acquisition of us or change of our control, although some stockholders might consider such proposals, if made, desirable. These provisions include, among others:\n\u25cf\nRedemption rights;\n\u25cf\nA requirement that we may not be removed as the general partner of our Operating Partnership without our consent;\n\u25cf\nTransfer restrictions on OP Units;\n\u25cf\nOur ability, as the sole member of the general partner of our Operating Partnership, in some cases, to amend the partnership agreement and to cause the Operating Partnership to issue units with terms that could delay, defer or prevent a merger or other change of control of us or our Operating Partnership without the consent of the limited partners; and\n\u25cf\nThe right of the limited partners to consent to direct or indirect transfers of the general partnership interest, including as a result of a merger or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, in the event that such transfer requires approval by our common stockholders.\nOur charter and bylaws, Maryland law and the partnership agreement of our Operating Partnership also contain other provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our shares of common stock or that our stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interest.\nWe may be unable to obtain or retain key personnel or continue to remain appropriately staffed.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon our executive officers and other key personnel. We rely on the services of Jeffrey Busch, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board; Robert Kiernan, our Chief Financial Officer; Alfonzo Leon, our Chief Investment Officer; Danica Holley, our Chief Operating Officer; and Jamie Barber, our Secretary and General Counsel, to manage our operations. Additionally, we rely on several other key personnel to manage our day-to-day operations, including accounting and finance staff, acquisition and due diligence personnel, asset managers and facilities personnel. \u00a0We cannot guarantee that all, or any one of these key personnel, will remain affiliated with us, especially given the current tightness of the U.S. labor market, nor do we maintain key person life insurance on any person. Our failure to retain key employees and retain highly skilled managerial and operational personnel, especially during a time of rapid growth for our business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nRisks Related to Our Qualification and Operation as a REIT\nFailure to remain qualified as a REIT would cause us to be taxed as a regular corporation, which would substantially reduce funds available for distributions to our stockholders.\nIf we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable\u00a0year, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for distributions to our stockholders because:\n\u25cf\nWe would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates;\n\u25cf\nWe could be subject to increased state and local taxes; and\n\u25cf\nUnless we are entitled to relief under certain U.S. federal income tax laws, we could not re-elect REIT status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we failed to qualify as a REIT.\n29\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will no longer be required to make distributions. As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and it could materially, adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nEven if we continue to qualify as a REIT, we may face other tax liabilities that could reduce our cash flows and negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nEven if we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income, taxes on income from some activities conducted because of a foreclosure, and state or local income, property, and transfer taxes. In addition, our taxable REIT subsidiary (\u201cTRS\u201d) will be subject to regular corporate U.S. federal, state, and local taxes. In addition, if our TRS borrows funds either from us or a third party, it may be unable to deduct all or a portion of the interest paid, resulting in a higher corporate-level tax liability. Specifically, the Code imposes a disallowance of deductions for business interest expense (even if paid to third parties) in excess of the sum of a taxpayer\u2019s business interest income and 30% of the adjusted taxable income of the business, which is its taxable income computed without regard to business interest income or expense, net operating losses or the pass-through income deduction. The TRS rules\u00a0also impose a 100% excise tax on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm\u2019s-length basis. Any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distributions to our stockholders, which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nFailure to make required distributions would subject us to U.S. federal corporate income tax.\nTo maintain our qualification as a REIT, we generally are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain, each\u00a0year to our stockholders. To the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders in a calendar\u00a0year is less than a minimum amount specified under the Code. Any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distributions to our stockholders which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nRecharacterization of sale-leaseback transactions may cause us to lose our REIT status.\nWe have engaged, and expect to engage in the future, in transactions in which we purchase healthcare facilities and lease them back to the sellers of such healthcare facilities. Although we have structured, and intend to continue to structure, any such sale-leaseback transaction so that the lease will be characterized as a \u201ctrue lease\u201d for tax purposes, thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the healthcare facility for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we cannot assure you that the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) will not challenge such characterization. If any sale-leaseback transaction is challenged as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, all of the payments that we receive from the tenant may not be treated as qualifying income for the 75% or 95% gross income tests required for REIT qualification and we may fail to qualify as a REIT as a result. If any sale-leaseback transaction is challenged as a financing transaction or loan for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would not be treated as the owner of the applicable healthcare facility and our deductions for depreciation and cost recovery relating to such healthcare facility would be disallowed. As a result, the amount of our REIT taxable income could be recalculated, which might cause us to fail to meet the distribution requirement required for REIT qualification. Although we may be able to cure such failure by making a distribution in a subsequent taxable\u00a0year and paying an interest charge, no assurance can be provided that we will be able to make the required distribution or pay the required interest charge. If we lose our REIT status, our business, financial condition, results of operations, ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock could be materially adversely affected.\nComplying with REIT requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities or liquidate otherwise attractive investments.\nTo maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders \n30\n\n\nTable of Contents\nand the ownership of our shares of stock. To meet these tests, we may be required to forego investments we might otherwise make. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our performance.\nWe must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified real estate assets. The remainder of our investment in securities (other than government securities, securities of TRSs and qualified real estate assets) generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer. In addition, in general, no more than 5% of the value of our assets (other than government securities, securities of TRSs and qualified real estate assets) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, no more than 20% of the value of our total assets can be represented by the securities of one or more TRSs, and no more than 25% of our assets can be represented by debt of \u201cpublicly offered REITs\u201d (i.e., REITs that are required to file annual and periodic reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act) that is not secured by real property or interests in real property. If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30\u00a0days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. As a result, we may be required to liquidate otherwise attractive investments. These actions could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nCertain taxes may limit our ability to dispose of our healthcare facilities.\nA REIT\u2019s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100% tax. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. We may be subject to the prohibited transaction tax equal to 100% of net gain upon a disposition of real property. Although a safe harbor to the characterization of the sale of real property by a REIT as a prohibited transaction is available, we cannot assure you that we can comply with the safe harbor or that we will avoid owning property that may be characterized as held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. Consequently, we may choose not to engage in certain sales of our healthcare facilities or may conduct such sales through a TRS, which would be subject to U.S. federal and state income taxation.\nWe may pay taxable dividends in our common stock and cash, in which case stockholders may sell shares of our common stock to pay tax on such dividends, placing downward pressure on the market price of our common stock.\nWe may satisfy the 90% distribution test with taxable distributions of our common stock. The IRS has issued Revenue Procedure 2017-45 authorizing elective cash/stock dividends to be made by publicly offered REITs. Pursuant to Revenue Procedure 2017-45,the IRS will treat the distribution of stock pursuant to an elective cash/stock dividend as a distribution of property under Section\u00a0301 of the Code (i.e., a dividend), as long as at least 20% of the total dividend is available in cash and certain other parameters detailed in the Revenue Procedure are satisfied. \u00a0On November 30, 2021, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2021-53, which temporarily reduces (through June 30, 2022) the minimum amount of the total distribution which must be available in cash to 10%.\nAlthough we have no current intention of paying dividends in our common stock, if we make a taxable dividend payable in cash and common stock, taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, stockholders may be required to pay income tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividends received. If a U.S. stockholder sells the common stock that it receives as a dividend to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our common stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to certain non-U.S. stockholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. federal income tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in common stock. If we make a taxable dividend payable in cash and our common stock and a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, it may put downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock.\nThe ability of the Board to revoke our REIT qualification without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders.\nOur charter provides that the Board may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election, without the approval of our stockholders, if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT. If we cease to qualify as a REIT, we would become subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our \n31\n\n\nTable of Contents\ntaxable income to our stockholders, which could materially adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nOur ownership of our TRS is subject to limitations and our transactions with our TRS will cause us to be subject to a 100% penalty tax on certain income or deductions if those transactions are not conducted on arm\u2019s-length terms.\nOverall, no more than 20% of the value of a REIT\u2019s assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRSs. Several provisions of the Code regarding the arrangements between a REIT and its TRSs ensure that a TRS will be subject to an appropriate level of U.S. federal income taxation. For example, the Code imposes a 100% excise tax on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm\u2019s-length basis. In addition, any income earned by a TRS that is attributable to services provided to its parent REIT, or on the REIT\u2019s behalf to any of its tenants, that is less than the amounts that would have been charged based upon arm\u2019s-length negotiations, will also be subject to a 100% excise tax. We will monitor the value of our investment in our TRS and any other TRS we may form for the purpose of ensuring compliance with TRS ownership limitations and will structure our transactions with any such TRS on terms that we believe are arm\u2019s length to avoid incurring the 100% excise taxes described above. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the 20% limitation or to avoid application of the 100% excise taxes. If we are subject to either 100% excise tax, our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock could be materially adversely affected.\nThe formation of a TRS lessee would increase our overall tax liability.\nWe may, in the future, form one or more TRS lessees to lease \u201cqualified health care properties\u201d from us. Any TRS lessee we may form will be subject to U.S. federal and state income tax on its taxable income, which will consist of the revenues from the qualified healthcare facilities leased by the TRS lessee, net of the operating expenses for such healthcare facilities and rent payments to us. In addition, if a TRS borrows funds either from us or a third party, it may be unable to deduct all or a portion of the interest paid, resulting in a higher corporate-level tax liability. Specifically, the Code imposes a disallowance of deductions for business interest expense (even if paid to third parties) in excess of the sum of a taxpayer\u2019s business interest income and 30% \u00a0of the adjusted taxable income of the business, which is its taxable income computed without regard to business interest income or expense, net operating losses or the pass-through income deduction. Accordingly, although our ownership of a TRS lessee would allow us to participate in the operating income from our healthcare facilities leased to the TRS lessee on an after-tax basis in addition to receiving rent, that operating income would be fully subject to U.S. federal and state income tax, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations, ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nIf leases of our healthcare facilities are not respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would fail to qualify as a REIT and would be subject to higher taxes and have less cash available for distribution to our stockholders.\nTo qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy two gross income tests, under which specified\u00a0percentages of our gross income must be derived from certain sources, such as \u201crents from real property.\u201d Rents paid to our Operating Partnership by third-party lessees and any TRS lessee that we may form in the future pursuant to the leases of our healthcare facilities will constitute substantially all of our gross income. For such rent to qualify as \u201crents from real property\u201d for purposes of the gross income tests, the leases must be respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes and not be treated as service contracts, joint ventures or some other type of arrangement. If our leases are not respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would fail to qualify as a REIT, which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations, ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nIf a TRS lessee failed to qualify as a TRS or the facility operators engaged by a TRS lessee did not qualify as \u201celigible independent contractors,\u201d we would fail to qualify as a REIT and would be subject to higher taxes and have less cash available for distribution to our stockholders.\nRent paid by a lessee that is a \u201crelated party tenant\u201d of ours will not be qualifying income for purposes of the two gross income tests applicable to REITs. We may, in the future, lease certain of our healthcare facilities that qualify as \u201cqualified health care properties\u201d to a TRS lessee. So long as that TRS lessee qualifies as a TRS, it will not be treated as a \u201crelated party tenant\u201d with respect to our healthcare facilities that are managed by an independent facility operator that qualifies as an \u201celigible independent contractor.\u201d We would seek to structure any future arrangements with a TRS lessee such that the TRS lessee would qualify to be treated as a TRS for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but there can be no assurance that the IRS would not challenge the status of a TRS for U.S. federal \n32\n\n\nTable of Contents\nincome tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in disqualifying a TRS lessee from treatment as a TRS, it is possible that we would fail to meet the asset tests applicable to REITs and a significant portion of our income would fail to qualify for the gross income tests. If we failed to meet either the asset or gross income tests, we would likely lose our REIT qualification for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nAdditionally, if the facility operators engaged by a TRS lessee do not qualify as \u201celigible independent contractors,\u201d we would fail to qualify as a REIT. Each of the facility operators that would enter into a management contract with any TRS lessee must qualify as an \u201celigible independent contractor\u201d under the REIT rules\u00a0in order for the rent paid to us by such a TRS lessee to be qualifying income for purposes of the REIT gross income tests. Among other requirements, to qualify as an eligible independent contractor a facility operator must not own, directly or indirectly, more than 35% of our outstanding shares and no person or group of persons can own more than 35% of our outstanding shares and the ownership interests of the facility operator, taking into account certain ownership attribution rules. The ownership attribution rules\u00a0that apply for purposes of these 35% thresholds are complex. Although we would monitor ownership of our shares of common stock by any facility operators and their owners, there can be no assurance that these ownership levels will not be exceeded.\nYou may be restricted from acquiring or transferring certain amounts of our common stock.\nThe stock ownership restrictions of the Code for REITs and the 9.8% share ownership limit in our charter may inhibit market activity in our capital stock and restrict our business combination opportunities.\nIn order to qualify as a REIT for each taxable\u00a0year, five or fewer individuals, as defined in the Code, may not own, beneficially or constructively, more than 50% in value of our issued and outstanding shares of capital stock at any time during the last half of a taxable\u00a0year. Attribution rules\u00a0in the Code determine if any individual or entity beneficially or constructively owns our shares of capital stock under this requirement. Additionally, at least 100 persons must beneficially own our shares of capital stock during at least 335\u00a0days of a taxable\u00a0year for each taxable\u00a0year. To help ensure that we meet these tests, our charter restricts the acquisition and ownership of shares of our capital stock.\nOur charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT. Unless exempted by the Board, our charter prohibits any person from beneficially or constructively owning more than 9.8% in value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our shares of capital stock. The Board may not grant an exemption from this restriction to any proposed transferee whose ownership in excess of 9.8% of the value of our outstanding shares would result in our failing to qualify as a REIT.\nDividends payable by REITs do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends.\nThe maximum U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to \u201cqualified dividend income\u201d payable to U.S. stockholders that are taxed at individual rates is 20% (plus the 3.8% surtax on net investment income, if applicable). Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the reduced rates on qualified dividend income. Rather, ordinary REIT dividends constitute \u201cqualified business income\u201d and thus a 20% deduction is available to individual taxpayers with respect to such dividends, resulting in a 29.6% maximum U.S. federal income tax rate (plus the 3.8% surtax on net investment income, if applicable) for individual U.S. stockholders. To qualify for this deduction, the stockholder receiving such dividends must hold the dividend-paying REIT stock for at least 46 days (taking into account certain special holding period rules) of the 91-day period beginning 45 days before the stock became ex-dividend and cannot be under an obligation to make related payments with respect to a position in substantially similar or related property. Without further legislative action, the 20% deduction applicable to ordinary REIT dividends will expire on January\u00a01, 2026. The more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are taxed at individual rates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stock of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including our common and preferred stock.\nWe may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes.\nAt any time, the U.S. federal income tax laws or regulations governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws or regulations may be amended. We cannot predict when or if any new U.S. federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation, or any amendment to any existing U.S. federal income tax law, regulation, or administrative interpretation, will be \n33\n\n\nTable of Contents\nadopted, promulgated, or become effective and any such law, regulation, or interpretation may take effect retroactively. We and our stockholders could be adversely affected by any such change in the U.S. federal income tax laws, regulations, or administrative interpretations which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operation, ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nIf our Operating Partnership failed to qualify as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences.\nWe believe that our Operating Partnership will be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, our Operating Partnership will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, including us, will be allocated, and may be required to pay tax with respect to, its share of our Operating Partnership\u2019s income. We cannot assure you, however, that the IRS will not challenge the status of our Operating Partnership or any other subsidiary partnership in which we own an interest as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating our Operating Partnership or any such other subsidiary partnership as an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to REITs and, accordingly, we would likely cease to qualify as a REIT. Also, the failure of our Operating Partnership or any subsidiary partnerships to qualify as a partnership could cause it to become subject to U.S. federal and state corporate income tax, which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock.\nTax protection agreements may limit our ability to sell or otherwise dispose of certain properties and may require our Operating Partnership to maintain certain debt levels that otherwise would not be required to operate our business.\nIn connection with contributions of properties to our Operating Partnership, our Operating Partnership has entered and may in the future enter into tax protection agreements under which it agrees to minimize the tax consequences to the contributing partners resulting from the sale or other disposition of the contributed properties. Tax protection agreements may make it economically prohibitive to sell any properties that are subject to such agreements even though it may otherwise be in our stockholders\u2019 best interests to do so. In addition, we may be required to maintain a minimum level of indebtedness throughout the term of any tax protection agreement regardless of whether such debt levels are otherwise required to operate our business. Nevertheless, we have entered and may in the future enter into tax protection agreements to assist contributors of properties to our Operating Partnership in deferring the recognition of taxable gain because of and after any such contribution.\n\u200b\nGeneral Risk Factors. \n\u200b\nWe are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility.\nOur business faces public scrutiny related to ESG activities. We risk damage to our reputation if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas, such as diversity and inclusion, environmental stewardship, support for local communities, corporate governance and transparency and considering ESG factors in our investment processes. Adverse incidents with respect to ESG activities could impact the cost of our operations and relationships with investors, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and the trading price of our common and preferred stock. \u00a0Additionally, new legislative or regulatory initiatives related to ESG could adversely affect our business.\n\u200b", "item7": ">ITEM 7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes to those financial statements, included elsewhere in this Report.\u00a0Some of the statements we make in this section are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

(the \u201cOperating Partnership\u201d). Our wholly owned subsidiary, Global Medical REIT GP LLC, is the sole general partner of our Operating Partnership \n37\n\n\nTable of Contents\nand, as of December 31, 2021, we owned 94.35% of the outstanding common operating partnership units (\u201cOP Units\u201d) of our Operating Partnership, with an aggregate of 5.65% of the Operating Partnership owned by holders of long-term incentive plan units (\u201cLTIP Units\u201d) and third-party limited partners who contributed properties or services to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units.\nOur revenues are derived from the rental and operating expense reimbursement payments we receive from our tenants, and most of our leases are medium to long-term triple net leases with contractual rent escalation provisions. \u00a0Our primary expenses are depreciation, interest, and general and administrative expenses. \u00a0We finance our acquisitions with a mixture of debt and equity primarily from our cash from operations, borrowings off our credit facility, and stock issuances. \u00a0\n2021 Executive Summary\nThe following tables summarize the material changes in our business and operations during the years presented.

As of December\u00a031, 2021, our portfolio consisted of gross investment in real estate of $1.3 billion, which was comprised of 105 facilities with an aggregate of 4.3 million leasable square feet and $103.1 million of annualized base rent.\n38\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAlso during the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed and funded a $6.8 million expansion at one of our Oklahoma City facilities. In connection with this expansion, we are receiving additional rental income from the tenant, Mercy Rehabilitation Hospital, which equates to an 11.8% cash return on this expansion.\nProperties Sold or Under Contract for Sale\nOn October 5, 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell a medical office building located in Belpre, Ohio for gross proceeds of approximately $44.6 million. The property had a net book value of approximately $29.5 million as of December 31, 2021. The transaction is expected to be completed no earlier than June 2022. The buyer is currently in the due diligence period and the transaction is subject to various closing contingencies. Accordingly, the transaction may not close on a timely basis, or the buyer may terminate the purchase agreement and not close the transaction. We intend to reinvest the sales proceeds in 2022 for future acquisitions.\nOn October 13, 2021, we sold a medical office building located in Prescott, Arizona receiving gross proceeds of $5.5 million, resulting in a gain of approximately $1.1 million. \u00a0\nCapital Raising Activity\nOn March 18, 2021, we closed an underwritten public offering of our common stock, including the related option to purchase additional shares granted to the underwriters. This transaction resulted in the issuance of 8.6 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $13.30 per share, generating gross proceeds of $114.7 million. \u00a0\n\u200b\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated gross proceeds of $97.9 million through at-the-market (\"ATM\") equity issuances of 6.7 million shares of our common stock at an average offering price of $14.56 per share. \n\u200b\nDebt and Hedging Activity\nOn May 3, 2021, we entered into an amended and restated credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) to, among other things, (i)\u00a0increase the overall capacity of the facility from $600 million to $750 million, consisting of the \u00a0$400 million Revolver and a $350 million term loan component (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d), (ii) extend the term of the Revolver to May 2025, with two six-month extension options, and extend the maturity of the Term Loan component to May 2026, (iii) convert the facility from a secured to an unsecured facility and (iv) implement a new pricing matrix. The Credit Facility includes a $500 million accordion feature. \n\u200b\nOn May 4, 2021, we entered into five forward starting interest rate swaps that will fix the LIBOR component on the Term Loan through its maturity. Currently, our interest rate swaps fix the LIBOR component of the Term Loan at a rate of 1.91% through August 2023. Subsequently, from August 2023 to August 2024 the LIBOR component of the Term Loan rate will be fixed at 1.61%. \u00a0Finally, from August 2024 to April 2026 the LIBOR component of the Term Loan rate will be fixed at 1.45%.\n\u200b\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we borrowed $221.6 million under our Credit Facility and repaid $224.2 million, for a net amount repaid of $2.6 million. As of December 31, 2021 and February 25, 2022, the gross outstanding Credit Facility balance was $522.6 million and $527.5 million, respectively.\n\u200b\nRecent Developments\n2022 Completed Acquisitions \nFrom December 31, 2021 through February 25, 2022, we completed one acquisition encompassing an aggregate of 17,713 leasable square feet for a purchase price of $5.1 million with annualized base rent of $0.3 million.\nAcquisitions Under Contract\nAs of February 25, 2022, we had seven acquisitions under contract for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $72.1 million. We are currently in the due diligence period for our properties under contract. If we identify problems with any of these properties or the operator of any property during our due diligence review, we may not close the transactions on a timely basis or we may terminate the purchase agreements and not close the transactions.\n39\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCapital Raising\nFrom December 31, 2021 through February 25, 2022, we generated gross proceeds of $8.3 million through ATM equity issuances of 0.5 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average offering price of $17.38 per share. As of February 25, 2022, we had $3.4 million remaining under the 2020 ATM Program.\n\u200b\nTrends Which May\u00a0Influence Our Results of Operations \nWe believe the following trends may positively impact our results of operations:\n\u25cf\nAn aging population\n. According to the 2020 U.S. Census, the nation\u2019s 65-and-older population has grown rapidly since 2010, driven by the aging of Baby Boomers born between 1946 and 1964. The 65-and-older population grew by over a third during the past decade, and by 3.2% from 2018 to 2019. We believe this segment of the U.S. population will utilize many of the services provided at our healthcare facilities such as orthopedics, cardiac, gastroenterology and rehabilitation.\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nA continuing shift towards outpatient care\n. According to the American Hospital Association, patients are demanding more outpatient operations. We believe this shift in patient preference from inpatient to outpatient facilities will benefit our tenants as most of our properties consist of outpatient facilities.\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nPhysician practice group and hospital consolidation\n. We believe the trend towards physician group consolidation will serve to strengthen the credit quality of our tenants if our tenants merge or are consolidated with larger health systems.\nWe believe the following trends may negatively impact our results of operations:\n\u25cf\nIncreased competition for acquisition opportunities\n. \u00a0We face increased competition for our target asset classes from both private funds and other public REITs, among other types of investors. Medical office properties have proven to be a resilient asset class during the COVID-19 pandemic as many tenants of such properties continued to pay rent during the pandemic, which was not the case for many other types of commercial real estate. Given the resiliency of medical office buildings, many real estate funds are now competing for acquisition opportunities in medical real estate, which may cause a decrease in overall capitalization rates and may make it more difficult for us to locate acquisition opportunities that meet our investment and return criteria. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u25cf\nIncreased interest rate environment\n. \u00a0Due to a strong labor market and high inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced in January 2022 its intention to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points (0.25%) in the near future and taper its asset purchase program. In addition to this stated near-term intended increase in the federal funds rate, many market participants expect additional increases in the federal funds rate during 2022. Due to this rate environment, LIBOR, which is the current reference rate for our floating rate debt, is expected to increase over 100 basis points (1.00%) during 2022. Based on our floating rate debt balance as of December 31, 2021, a 100 basis point increase in LIBOR would have caused our annual interest expense in 2021 to increase by approximately $1.7 million. \n\u25cf\nContinuation of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\u00a0\u2013 U.S economic growth in 2021 rebounded substantially from 2020 as COVID-19 vaccines became readily available to most of the U.S. population. However, the rapid spread of the Omicron variant beginning in late 2021 and the resulting increase in hospital admissions stressed the U.S. healthcare system, as more people sought treatment for COVID-19 infections and many healthcare workers became unavailable due to them having left the profession or being infected themselves. Although the rate of U.S. infections from the Omicron variant is expected to decrease by early-to mid-2022, we are unable to predict the overall effect it will have on the U.S. economy, and specifically within the healthcare industry, including whether labor shortages will continue in the healthcare industry, which may disrupt our tenants\u2019 businesses or increase their recruitment and labor costs. \u00a0In addition, the Omicron variant has caused widespread labor shortages. \u00a0These labor shortages have affected a number of the outside consultants we rely on to, among other things, complete our property acquisitions, which, in certain circumstances, has affected those consultants\u2019 ability to provide timely services to us. \u00a0 \u00a0\n40\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe volatility of COVID-19, as recently evidenced by the trajectory of the Omicron variant, is unpredictable and there are no assurances that an equally or more volatile variant will not emerge in the future. \u00a0Although to date our liquidity and operational and financial performance has not been materially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the recent Omicron variant, we cannot predict the effects future resurgences will have on our tenants and our business going forward.\n\u25cf\nChanges in third party reimbursement methods and policies\n. The price of healthcare services has been increasing, and, as a result, we believe that third-party payors, such as Medicare and commercial insurance companies, will continue to scrutinize and reduce the types of healthcare services eligible for, and the amounts of, reimbursement under their health insurance plans. Additionally, many employer-based insurance plans continue to increase the\u00a0percentage of insurance premiums for which covered individuals are responsible, which makes healthcare services more expensive for individuals. We expect these trends will only be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, as medical expenditures increased significantly during the pandemic. If these trends continue, our tenants\u2019 businesses will continue to be negatively affected, which may impact their ability to pay rent to us.\nCritical Accounting Estimates \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base estimates on the best information available to us at the time, our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time-to-time, we re-evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. \nFor a more detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note\u00a02\u00a0\u2013 \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the footnotes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that it may require complex judgment in its application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nWe consider our critical accounting estimates to be those used in the determination of the reported amounts and disclosure related to the following:\n\u25cf\nInvestment in Real Estate\n\u25cf\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\u25cf\nRevenue Recognition\nInvestment in Real Estate\nAll of our facility acquisitions for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were accounted for as asset acquisitions because substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets that we acquired were concentrated in a single asset or group of similar identifiable assets. Accordingly, the purchase prices of acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities were recorded and allocated at fair value on a relative basis. The recorded allocations are based on estimated cash flow projections of the properties acquired which incorporates discount, capitalization and interest rates as well as available comparable market information. We use considerable judgement in our estimates of cash flow projections, discount, capitalization and interest rates, fair market lease rates, carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, and costs to execute similar leases. \n\u200b\nWhile our methodology for purchase price allocations did not change during the year ended December 31, 2021, the real estate market is fluid and our assumptions are based on information currently available in the market at the time of acquisition. Significant increases or decreases in these key estimates, particularly with regards to cash flow projections and discount and capitalization rates, would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value allocated to acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities.\n\u200b\nIn the case of the fair value of buildings and fair value of land and certain other intangibles, our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation or amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or \n41\n\n\nTable of Contents\nthe remaining lease term. In the case of the fair value of above-market or below-market lease intangibles, our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of rental revenue we record as these values are amortized as a reduction of or an addition to rental income over the estimated remaining term of the respective leases.\n\u200b\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review our real estate assets on an asset group basis for impairment. We identify an asset group based on the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. In the impairment analysis we must determine whether there are indicators of impairment. For operating properties, these indicators could include a reduction in our estimated hold period, a significant decline in a property\u2019s leasing percentage, a current period operating loss or negative cash flows combined with a history of losses at the property, a significant decline in lease rates for that property or others in the property\u2019s market, a significant change in the market value of the property, or an adverse change in the financial condition of significant tenants. \nIf we determine that an asset has indicators of impairment, we must determine whether the undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset exceed the carrying amount of the asset. In calculating the undiscounted net cash flows of an asset, we use considerable judgement to estimate a number of inputs. We must estimate future rental rates, future capital expenditures, future operating expenses, and market capitalization rates for residual values, among other things. In addition, if there are alternative strategies for the future use of the asset, we assess the probability of each alternative strategy and perform a probability-weighted undiscounted cash flow analysis to assess the recoverability of the asset. \nIn determining the fair value of an asset, we exercise considerable judgment on a number of factors. We may determine fair value by using a discounted cash flow calculation or by utilizing comparable market information. We use judgement to determine an appropriate discount rate to apply to the cash flows in the discounted cash flow calculation. We also use judgment in analyzing comparable market information because no two real estate assets are identical in location and price. \n\u200b\nThe estimates and judgments used in the impairment process are highly subjective and susceptible to frequent change. Significant increases or decreases in any of these inputs, particularly with regards to cash flow projections and discount and capitalization rates, would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement of the real estate assets being assessed. Additionally, changes in economic and operating conditions, including changes in the financial condition of our tenants, and changes to our intent and ability to hold the related asset, that occur subsequent to our impairment assessment could impact the assumptions used in that assessment and could result in future charges to earnings if assumptions regarding those investments differ from actual results.\n\u200b\nRevenue Recognition\nOur operations primarily consist of rental revenue earned from tenants under leasing arrangements which provide for minimum rent and escalations. Management exercises considerable judgment in the rental property revenue recognition process including the treatment of the contractual rental stream and the determination of its collectability.\n\u200b\nOur leases have been accounted for as operating leases. For operating leases with contingent rental escalators, revenue is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due during the period. Revenue from leases with fixed annual rental escalators are recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease term, when we believe substantially all lease income, including the related straight-line receivable, is probable of collection. \nWe monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants and operators and exercise considerable judgement in assessing the probability of collection. Our assessment of collectability incorporates available operational performance measures such as sales and the aging of billed amounts as well as other publicly available information with respect to our tenant\u2019s financial condition, liquidity and capital resources, including declines in such conditions. In the event that we determine receivables are not probable of collection, lease income will be recorded on a cash basis, with the corresponding tenant receivable and straight-line rent receivable charged as a direct write-off against rental revenue in the period of the change in our collectability determination. If management\u2019s assumptions regarding the collectability of lease related receivables prove incorrect, we could experience decreases in rental revenue, including decreases in excess of any amounts initially recognized.\n \n\u200b\n42\n\n\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe major factors that resulted in variances in our results of operations for each revenue and expense category for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 were (i) the increase in the size of our property portfolio (our total investments in real estate, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, was $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively) and (ii) our management internalization transaction that was completed in July 2020.\nFor a discussion related to our results of operations for\u00a0the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020\u00a0compared to\u00a0the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019,\u00a0refer to Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a07.

The increase was primarily the result of rental revenue earned from the facilities we acquired during 2021, as well as from the recognition of a full year of rental revenue in 2021 from acquisitions that were completed during 2020. Within that increase, $11.6 million in revenue was recognized from net lease expense recoveries during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $8.9 million for the same period in 2020. \n\u200b\nAdditionally, total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 reflected the recognition of a reserve for approximately $0.4 million of rent, which included $0.1 million of deferred rent. Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflected the recognition of a reserve for approximately $1.4 million of rent, which included $0.4 million of deferred rent. These reserves relate to tenants for which the Company could not conclude that future rent collections were probable and, therefore, accounts for these tenants following the cash basis of accounting. \u00a0 \n43\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u200b\nExpenses\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $16.5 million, compared to $11.9 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of $4.6 million. The increase was primarily driven by our recognition of compensation-related costs and other administrative expenses that prior to the management internalization transaction were the obligation of our former advisor. In addition, this increase was due to an increase in non-cash LTIP compensation expense, which was $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $5.3 million for the same period in 2020. \nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $15.5 million, compared with $10.9 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of $4.6 million. The increase results primarily from $11.6 million of recoverable property operating expenses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $8.9 million for the same period in 2020. \u00a0In addition, our operating expenses include $2.3 million of non-recoverable property operating expenses from gross leases for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $1.2 million for the same period in 2020.\n\u200b\nManagement Fees\u00a0\u2013 related party\nAs a result of the completion of the management internalization transaction, we incurred no management fee expense for the year ended December 31, 2021. \u00a0Management fee expense was $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. \nDepreciation Expense\nDepreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $33.8 million, compared to $26.7 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of $7.1 million. The increase resulted primarily from depreciation expense incurred on the facilities we acquired during 2021, as well as from the recognition of a full\u00a0year of depreciation expense in 2021 from acquisitions that were completed during 2020.\nAmortization Expense\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $13.1 million, compared to $9.6 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of $3.5 million. The increase resulted primarily from amortization expense incurred on intangible assets related to the facilities we acquired during 2021, as well as from the recognition of a full\u00a0year of amortization expense in 2021 from acquisitions that were completed during 2020.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $19.7 million, compared to $18.7 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of $1.0 million. This increase was primarily due to higher average borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the same period last year, the proceeds of which were primarily used to finance our property acquisitions during that time period, partially offset by lower interest rates.\nThe weighted average interest rate of our debt for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 3.06% compared to 3.41% in 2020. Additionally, the weighted average interest rate and term of our debt was 2.87% and 4.28 years, respectively, at December\u00a031, 2021.\nManagement Internalization Expense\nAs a result of the completion of the management internalization transaction, we had no management internalization expense for the year ended December 31, 2021. Management internalization expense was $14.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which included $12.1 million related to the settlement of a preexisting contractual relationship and $1.9 million of professional fees associated with the management internalization transaction.\n44\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIncome (Loss) Before Gain on Sale of Investment Property\nIncome before gain on sale of investment property for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $17.3 million, compared to loss before gain on sale of investment property of $(2.5) million for the same period in 2020, an increase of $19.8 million. The increase resulted from the one-time recognition of $14 million of management internalization expenses in 2020 and an increase in rental revenue during the current year, partially offset by an increase in total expenses. \nGain on Sale of Investment Property\nOn October 13, 2021, the Company sold a medical office building located in Prescott, Arizona receiving gross proceeds of $5.5 million, resulting in a gain of approximately $1.1 million. \u00a0The Company acquired the facility in February 2017. The Company had no property sales in 2020.\nNet Income (Loss)\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $18.3 million compared to net loss of $(2.5) million for the same period in 2020, an increase of $20.8 million. The increase resulted from the one-time recognition of $14 million of management internalization expenses in 2020 and an increase in rental revenue during the current year and the gain on the sale of an investment property, partially offset by an increase in total expenses. \nAssets and Liabilities\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, our principal assets consisted of investments in real estate, net, of $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. Our liquid assets consisted primarily of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of $12.8 million and $10.8\u00a0million, as of December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe increase in our investments in real estate, net, to $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2021 compared to $1.0 billion as of December\u00a031, 2020, was primarily the result of the 20 acquisitions that we completed during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe increase in our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balances to $12.8 million as of December 31, 2021, compared to $10.8\u00a0million as of December\u00a031, 2020, was primarily due to net proceeds received from common equity offerings, net proceeds received from the sale of an investment property, and net cash provided by operating activities. Cash inflows were partially offset by funds used to acquire real estate, paydown debt, pay debt issuance costs related to the Credit Facility, and pay dividends to our common and preferred stockholders and OP Unit and LTIP Unit holders of our Operating Partnership.\nThe decrease in our total liabilities to $625.9 million as of December 31, 2021 compared to $643.1 million as of December\u00a031, 2020, was primarily the result of debt repayments during 2021 and the resulting lower net borrowings outstanding as well as a decrease in the derivative liability balance. This decrease was partially offset by an increases in dividends payable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and prepaid rent.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nOur short-term (up to 12 months) liquidity requirements include:\n\u25cf\nInterest expense and scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness;\n\u25cf\nGeneral and administrative expenses;\n\u25cf\nProperty operating expenses; \n\u25cf\nProperty acquisitions; \n\u25cf\nDistributions on our common and preferred stockholders and OP Unit and LTIP Unit holders in our Operating Partnership; and\n\u25cf\nCapital and tenant improvements.\n45\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn 2022, we are contractually obligated to pay, or have capital commitments for, approximately (i) $17.7 million of principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt, and (ii) $0.4 million in ground and operating lease expenses. \u00a0In addition, our preferred stock becomes redeemable by us beginning in September 2022. The liquidation preference for our preferred stock is $77.6 million, and, if we decide to fully redeem, we would have to pay this amount plus fees and expenses. \u00a0 \nOur long-term (beyond 12 months) liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for acquisitions, capital and tenant improvements at our properties, scheduled debt maturities, general and administrative expenses, operating expenses, and distributions. Beyond 2022, we are contractually obligated to pay, or have capital commitments for, approximately (i) $629.1 million of principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt (see \u2014 \u201cDebt Financing\u201d for a schedule of our debt maturities), and (ii) $6.7 million in ground and operating lease expenses. \nWe expect to satisfy our short and long-term liquidity needs through various internal and external sources, including cash flow from operations, debt financing, sales of additional equity securities, the issuance of OP Units in connection with acquisitions of additional properties, proceeds from select property dispositions and recapitalization transactions.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had aggregate capital improvement commitments and obligations to improve, expand, and maintain the Company\u2019s existing facilities of approximately $28 million. Many of these amounts are subject to contingencies that make it difficult to predict when they will be utilized, if at all. In accordance with the terms of the Company\u2019s leases, capital improvement obligations in the next 12 months could total up to approximately $24 million.\nInternal Sources of Liquidity \n\u200b\nOur primary internal sources of liquidity include cash flow from operations and proceeds from select property dispositions and recapitalization transactions. \u00a0\n\u200b\nExternal Sources of Liquidity \n\u200b\nOur primary external sources of liquidity include net proceeds received from equity issuances, including the issuance of OP Units in connection with acquisitions of additional properties, and debt financing, including borrowings under our Credit Facility and secured term loans. \n\u200b\nEquity Issuances.\n \n\u200b\nOn March 18, 2021, we closed an underwritten public offering of our common stock, including the related option to purchase additional shares granted to the underwriters. This transaction resulted in the issuance of 8.6 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $13.30 per share, generating gross proceeds of $114.7 million. \u00a0\nIn August 2020, the Company and the Operating Partnership entered into a Sales Agreement with certain sales agents, pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, up to $150 million\u00a0of its common stock (the \u201c2020 ATM Program\u201d). During the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated gross proceeds of $97.9 million through ATM equity issuances of 6.7 million shares of our common stock at an average offering price of $14.56 per share. \n\u200b\nFrom December 31, 2021 through February 25, 2022, we generated gross proceeds of $8.3 million through ATM equity issuances of 0.5 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average offering price of $17.38 per share. As of February 25, 2022, we had $3.4 million remaining under the 2020 ATM Program.\n\u200b\nDebt Financing\n.\n \u00a0\n\u200b\nThe table below provides a summary of our debt as of December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands):\n\u200b\n46\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nMaturity\n\u200b\nWeighted Avg.\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nOutstanding\n\u200b\n(in years)\n\u200b\nInterest Rate\n\u200b\nCredit Facility - Term, gross\n\u200b\n$ 350,000\n\u200b\n4.34 \n\u200b\n3.23%\n(1)\n\u200b\nCredit Facility - Revolver, gross\n\u200b\n 172,600\n\u200b\n4.34 \n\u200b\n1.46%\n(2)\n\u200b\nNotes payable,  gross\n\u200b\n 57,769\n\u200b\n3.73 \n\u200b\n4.82%\n\u200b\n      Total \n\u200b\n$ 580,369\n\u200b\n4.28 \n\u200b\n2.87%\n\u200b\n(1)\n    The weighted average interest rate on the Credit Facility Term Loan includes the impact of interest rate swaps discussed in the \u201c\nHedging Instruments\n\u201d section below.\n(2)\nThe Credit Facility Revolver term expires in August 2025 subject to two six-month Company controlled extension options.\nCredit Facility. \nAs described in \u201cDebt and Hedging Activity\u201d above, the Credit Facility consists of a $350 million Term Loan and a $400 million Revolver. The Credit Facility also contains a $500 million accordion feature. As of February 25, 2022, we had unutilized borrowing capacity under the Revolver of approximately $222.5 million.\nThe Credit Facility is an unsecured facility with an initial term of four years for the Revolver (subject to two, six-month extension options) and an initial term of five years for the Term Loan. The Credit Facility also contains the following interest rate pricing grid:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nRevolver LIBOR Margin\n\u200b\nTerm Loan LIBOR Margin\nLeverage Based Pricing\nCurrent \nPrior\n\u200b\nCurrent \nPrior\n< 40%\n1.25%\nN/A\n\u200b\n1.20%\nN/A\n>\n 40% and < 45%\n1.35%\n1.40%\n\u200b\n1.30%\n1.35%\n>\n 45% and < 50%\n1.50%\n1.65%\n\u200b\n1.45%\n1.60%\n>\n 50 % and < 55%\n1.75%\n1.90%\n\u200b\n1.70%\n1.85%\n>\n 55%\n2.00%\n2.15%\n\u200b\n1.95%\n2.10%\nWe are subject to a number of financial covenants under the Credit Facility, including, among other things, the following as of the end of each fiscal quarter, (i)\u00a0a maximum consolidated unsecured leverage ratio of less than 60%, (ii)\u00a0a maximum consolidated secured leverage ratio of less than 30%, (iii) a maximum consolidated secured recourse leverage ratio of less than 10%, (iv) a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.50:1.00, (v) a minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio of 1.50:1.00, (vi) a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of less than 60%, and (vii)\u00a0a minimum net worth of $345 million plus 75% of all net proceeds raised through equity offerings subsequent to December 31, 2020. As of February 25, 2022, management believed it complied with all of the financial and non-financial covenants contained in the Credit Facility.\nHedging Instruments. \nWe have six interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $350 million that are used to manage our interest rate risk and fix the LIBOR component on the Term Loan. An aggregate of $150 million of the swaps mature in August\u00a02023 and the remaining $200 million mature in August\u00a02024. In addition, we have five forward starting interest rate swaps that will be effective on the maturity dates of the existing interest rate swaps. The forward starting swaps each have a maturity date of April 2026 and will fix the LIBOR component on the Term Loan through its maturity. Currently, the interest rate swaps fix the LIBOR component of the Term Loan at a rate of 1.91% through August 2023. Subsequently, from August 2023 to August 2024 the LIBOR component of the Term Loan rate will be fixed at 1.61%. \u00a0Finally, from August 2024 to April 2026 the LIBOR component of the Term Loan rate will be fixed at 1.45%. \nLIBOR Transition.\n \nIn July\u00a02017, the FCA, which regulates LIBOR, announced its intention to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. As a result, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized the ARRC which identified the SOFR as its preferred alternative to LIBOR in derivatives and other financial contracts. On December 31, 2021, IBA, the administrator of LIBOR, announced plans to cease publication for all USD LIBOR tenors (except the one- and two-week tenors, which ceased on December 31, 2021) on June 30, 2023. The Credit Facility provides that, on or about the LIBOR cessation date (subject to an early opt-in election), LIBOR shall be replaced as a benchmark rate in the Credit Facility with term SOFR (or another alternative rate if term SOFR is not able to be determined), with such adjustments to cause the new benchmark rate to be economically equivalent to LIBOR at the time of the LIBOR cessation date. \n47\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe Company\u2019s interest rate swap agreements are indexed to LIBOR and the Company will need to enter into bilateral agreements with its swap counterparties to institute a fallback reference rate once LIBOR ceases to be published. It is expected that most market participants will transition to compounding SOFR as the new reference rate for derivative contracts. If the Company transitions its interest rate swaps to compounded SOFR, such transition may impact the effectiveness of its hedging instruments as the reference rate for the Credit Facility (term SOFR) will be different than the reference rate for its interest rate swaps (compounded SOFR). \nCash Flow Information  \nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $69.0 million, compared with $34.5 million for the same period in 2020. The increase during the 2021 period was primarily due to the increase in net income as well as increases in depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020.\n\u200b\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $194.7 million, compared with $223.7 million for the same period in 2020. The decrease during the 2021 period was primarily the result of less real estate investment activity in the 2021 period compared to the same period in 2020, partially offset by net proceeds received from the sale of an investment property in 2021. Additionally, the prior year included cash paid to acquire our former advisor in connection with the management internalization transaction.\n\u200b\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $127.7 million, compared with $192.7 million for the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to net repayments on the Credit Facility, principal payments on our notes payable, the payment of debt issuance costs related to the Credit Facility, and higher dividends paid to our common stockholders, partially offset by net proceeds received from our common stock offerings.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nManagement considers certain non-GAAP financial measures to be useful supplemental measures of the Company's operating performance. A non-GAAP financial measure is generally defined as one that purports to measure financial performance, financial position or cash flows, but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable measure determined in accordance with GAAP.\u00a0The Company reports non-GAAP financial measures because these measures are observed by management to also be among the most predominant measures used by the REIT industry and by industry analysts to evaluate REITs. For these reasons, management deems it appropriate to disclose and discuss these non-GAAP financial measures.\u00a0Set forth below are descriptions of the non-GAAP financial measures management considers relevant to the Company's business and useful to investors, as well as reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures presented herein are not necessarily identical to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. These measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income, as indicators of the Company's financial performance, or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as measures of the Company's liquidity, nor are these measures necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs. Management believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the Company's historical consolidated operating results, these measures should be examined in conjunction with net income and cash flows from operations as presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial data included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFunds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations\nFunds from operations (\u201cFFO\u201d) and adjusted funds from operations (\u201cAFFO\u201d) are non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of the rules\u00a0of the SEC. The Company considers FFO and AFFO to be important supplemental measures of its operating performance and believes FFO is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting their results.\nIn accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts\u2019 (\u201cNAREIT\u201d) definition, FFO means net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP before noncontrolling interests of holders of OP Units and LTIP Units, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property and extraordinary items, less preferred stock dividends, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of debt issuance costs and the amortization of above and below market leases), and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Because FFO excludes real estate-related depreciation and amortization \n48\n\n\nTable of Contents\n(other than amortization of debt issuance costs and above and below market lease amortization expense), the Company believes that FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared period-over-period, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, development activities and interest expense, providing perspective not immediately apparent from the closest GAAP measurement, net income or loss.\nAFFO is a non-GAAP measure used by many investors and analysts to measure a real estate company\u2019s operating performance by removing the effect of items that do not reflect ongoing property operations. Management calculates AFFO by modifying the NAREIT computation of FFO by adjusting it for certain cash and non-cash items and certain recurring and non-recurring items. For the Company these items include recurring acquisition and disposition costs, loss on the extinguishment of debt, recurring straight line deferred rental revenue, recurring stock-based compensation expense, recurring amortization of above and below market leases, recurring amortization of debt issuance costs, recurring lease commissions, management internalization costs, and other items.\nManagement believes that reporting AFFO in addition to FFO is a useful supplemental measure for the investment community to use when evaluating the operating performance of the Company on a comparative basis. \nA reconciliation of FFO and AFFO for the\u00a0years ended December\u00a031, 2021, 2020, and 2019 is as follows:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nYear Ended \n\u200b\n\u200b\nDecember\u00a031,\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2021\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2020\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2019\n\u200b\n\u200b\n(unaudited, in thousands except per share and unit amounts)\nNet income (loss) \n\u200b\n$\n 18,342\n\u200b\n$\n (2,499)\n\u200b\n$\n 9,588\nLess: Preferred stock dividends\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (5,822)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (5,822)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (5,822)\nDepreciation and amortization expense\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 46,764\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 36,302\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 24,635\nGain on sale of investment property\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (1,069)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \u2014\nFFO\n\u200b\n$\n 58,215\n\u200b\n$\n 27,981\n\u200b\n$\n 28,401\nInternalization expense - settlement of a preexisting contractual relationship\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 12,094\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \u2014\nInternalization expense - other transaction costs\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 1,911\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \u2014\nAmortization of above market leases, net\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 520\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 504\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 881\nStraight line deferred rental revenue\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (5,317)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (5,680)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (5,806)\nStock-based compensation expense\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 5,810\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 5,319\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 3,336\nAmortization of debt issuance costs and other\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 1,982\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 1,450\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 1,312\nPreacquisition expense\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 151\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 365\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 271\nAFFO\n\u200b\n$\n 61,361\n\u200b\n$\n 43,944\n\u200b\n$\n 28,395\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nNet income (loss) attributable to common stockholders per share \u2013 basic and diluted\n\u200b\n$\n 0.19\n\u200b\n$\n (0.17)\n\u200b\n$\n 0.10\nFFO per share and unit\n\u200b\n$\n 0.90\n\u200b\n$\n 0.56\n\u200b\n$\n 0.75\nAFFO per share and unit\n\u200b\n$\n 0.95\n\u200b\n$\n 0.88\n\u200b\n$\n 0.75\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nWeighted Average Shares and Units Outstanding \u2013 basic and diluted\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 64,548\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 49,791\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 37,789\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nWeighted Average Shares and Units Outstanding:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nWeighted Average Common Shares\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 60,640\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 46,256\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 33,865\nWeighted Average OP Units\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 1,732\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 2,172\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 3,144\nWeighted Average LTIP Units\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 2,176\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 1,363\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 780\nWeighted Average Shares and Units Outstanding \u2013 basic and diluted\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 64,548\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 49,791\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 37,789\n\u200b\nEarnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (EBITDAre) and Adjusted EBITDAre \nThe Company calculates EBITDA\nre\n\u00a0in accordance with standards established by NAREIT and defines EBITDA\nre\n\u00a0as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP plus depreciation and amortization, interest expense, gain or loss on the sale of investment properties, and impairment loss, as applicable.

In pursuing our business and investment objectives, we expect that the primary market risk to which we will be exposed is interest rate risk.\nWe may be exposed to the effects of interest rate changes primarily as a result of debt used to acquire healthcare facilities, including borrowings under the Credit Facility. The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the value of our variable rate financial obligations to selected changes in market interest rates. The range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $172.6 million of unhedged borrowings outstanding under the Revolver (before the netting of unamortized debt issuance costs) that bears interest at a variable rate. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\u00a0\u2014 Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for a detailed discussion of our Credit Facility. At December\u00a031, 2021, LIBOR on our outstanding floating-rate borrowings was 0.11%. Assuming no increase in the amount of our variable interest rate debt, if LIBOR increased 100 basis points, our cash flow would decrease by approximately $1.7\u00a0million annually. Assuming no increase in the amount of our variable rate debt, if LIBOR were reduced 100 basis points, our cash flow would increase by approximately $1.7 million annually.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our exposure to interest rate risk was not materially different from our exposure as of December 31, 2021, as the balance of our unhedged borrowings on those dates had not changed materially. \u00a0\nOur interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve our objectives, we may borrow at fixed rates or floating rates. See \u201c\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Liquidity and Capital Resources\u2014Hedging Instruments\n,\u201d for a description of our interest rate swaps. See \u201c\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Liquidity and Capital Resources\u2014LIBOR Transition\n,\u201d for a discussion of the effects of the upcoming LIBOR transition on our hedging instruments.\nWe may enter into additional derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps and caps, in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on our future borrowings. We will not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes.\n50\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn addition to changes in interest rates, the value of our investments is subject to fluctuations based on changes in local and regional economic conditions and changes in the creditworthiness of tenants/operators and borrowers, which may affect our ability to refinance our debt if necessary.\n\u200b\n51\n\n\nTable of Contents", "companyName": "Global Medical REIT Inc.", "cusip": "37954Y442"}
