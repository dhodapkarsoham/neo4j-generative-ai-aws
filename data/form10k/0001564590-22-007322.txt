{"item1": ">Item 1. Business Description \n\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. (\u201cBerkshire,\u201d \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cRegistrant\u201d) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in numerous diverse business activities. The most important of these are insurance businesses conducted on both a primary basis and a reinsurance basis, a freight rail transportation business and a group of utility and energy generation and distribution businesses. Berkshire also owns and operates numerous other businesses engaged in a variety of manufacturing, services, retailing and other activities. Berkshire is domiciled in the state of Delaware, and its corporate headquarters is in Omaha, Nebraska. \n\n\nBerkshire\u2019s operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Berkshire\u2019s corporate senior management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. \n\n\nBerkshire\u2019s senior management is also responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshire\u2019s corporate governance practices, including monitoring governance efforts, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed. Berkshire\u2019s Board of Directors is responsible for assuring an appropriate successor to the Chief Executive Officer. The Berkshire Code of Business Conduct and Ethics emphasizes, among other things, the commitment to ethics and compliance with the law and provides basic standards for ethical and legal behavior of its employees. \n\n\nHuman capital and resources are an integral and essential component of Berkshire\u2019s businesses. Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries employed approximately 372,000 people worldwide at the end of 2021, of which approximately 77% were in the United States and 21% were represented by unions. Employees engage in a wide variety of occupations. Consistent with Berkshire\u2019s decentralized management philosophy, Berkshire\u2019s operating businesses individually establish specific policies and practices concerning the attraction and retention of personnel within the organizations. Given the wide variations in the nature and size of business activities, policies and practices often vary widely among Berkshire\u2019s operating subsidiaries. Policies and practices commonly address, among other things: maintaining a safe work environment and minimizing or eliminating workplace injuries; offering competitive compensation to employees, which includes various health insurance and retirement benefits, as well as other benefits such as incentives to recognize and reward performance; wellness programs; training, learning and career advancement opportunities; and hiring practices intended to identify qualified candidates and promote diversity and inclusion in the workforce.\n\n\nInsurance and Reinsurance Businesses \n\n\nBerkshire\u2019s insurance and reinsurance business activities are conducted through numerous domestic and foreign-based insurance subsidiaries. Berkshire\u2019s insurance subsidiaries provide insurance and reinsurance of property and casualty risks and reinsurance of life and health risks worldwide. Berkshire\u2019s insurance subsidiaries employed approximately 50,500 people at the end of 2021. For purposes of this discussion, entities that provide insurance or reinsurance are referred to as insurers. \n\n\nIn direct or primary insurance activities, the insurer assumes the risk of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks. Such risks may relate to property, casualty (or liability), life, accident, health, financial or other perils that may arise from an insurable event. In reinsurance activities, the insurer assumes defined portions of risks that other direct insurers or reinsurers assumed in their own insuring activities. \n\n\nReinsurance contracts are normally classified as treaty or facultative contracts. Treaty reinsurance refers to reinsurance coverage for all or a portion of a specified group or class of risks ceded by a direct insurer or reinsurer, while facultative reinsurance involves coverage of specific individual underlying risks. Reinsurance contracts are further classified as quota-share or excess. Under quota-share (proportional or pro-rata) reinsurance, the reinsurer shares proportionally in the original premiums and losses of the direct insurer or reinsurer. Excess (or non-proportional) reinsurance provides for the indemnification of the direct insurer or reinsurer for all or a portion of the loss in excess of an agreed upon amount or \u201cretention.\u201d Both quota-share and excess reinsurance contracts may provide for aggregate limits of indemnification. \n\n\nInsurance and reinsurance are generally subject to regulatory oversight throughout the world. Except for regulatory considerations, there are virtually no barriers to entry into the insurance and reinsurance industry. Competitors may be domestic or foreign, as well as licensed or unlicensed. The number of competitors within the industry is not known. Insurers compete on the basis of reliability, financial strength and stability, financial ratings, underwriting consistency, service, business ethics, price, performance, capacity, policy terms and coverage conditions. \n\n\nK-1\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInsurers based in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) are subject to regulation by their states of domicile and by those states in which they are licensed to write policies on an admitted basis. The primary focus of regulation is to assure that insurers are financially solvent and that policyholder interests are otherwise protected. States establish minimum capital levels for insurance companies and establish guidelines for permissible business and investment activities. States have the authority to suspend or revoke a company\u2019s authority to do business as conditions warrant. States regulate the payment of dividends by insurance companies to their shareholders and other transactions with affiliates. Dividends, capital distributions and other transactions of extraordinary amounts are subject to prior regulatory approval. \n\n\nInsurers may market, sell and service insurance policies in the states where they are licensed. These insurers are referred to as admitted insurers. Admitted insurers are generally required to obtain regulatory approval of their policy forms and premium rates. Non-admitted insurance markets have developed to provide insurance that is otherwise unavailable through admitted insurers. Non-admitted insurance, often referred to as \u201cexcess and surplus\u201d lines, is procured by either state-licensed surplus lines brokers who place risks with insurers not licensed in that state or by the insured party\u2019s direct procurement from non-admitted insurers. Non-admitted insurance is subject to considerably less regulation with respect to policy rates and forms. Reinsurers are normally not required to obtain regulatory approval of premium rates or reinsurance contracts. \n\n\nThe insurance regulators of every state participate in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\u201cNAIC\u201d). The NAIC adopts forms, instructions and accounting procedures for use by U.S. insurers in preparing and filing annual statutory financial statements. However, an insurer\u2019s state of domicile has ultimate authority over these matters. In addition to its activities relating to the annual statement, the NAIC develops or adopts statutory accounting principles, model laws, regulations and programs for use by its members. Such matters deal with regulatory oversight of solvency, risk management, compliance with financial regulation standards and risk-based capital reporting requirements. \n\n\nU.S. states, through the NAIC, and international insurance regulators through the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (\u201cIAIS\u201d) have been developing standards and best practices focused on establishing a common set of principles (\u201cInsurance Core Principles\u201d) and framework (\u201cComFrame\u201d) for the regulation of large multi-national insurance groups. The IAIS is developing capital standards for internationally active insurance groups (the \u201cInsurance Capital Standard\u201d) based on a consolidated group approach and is also evaluating a potentially comparable group capital standard based on the aggregation of regulated entities and their underlying local capital requirements (the \u201cAggregation Method\u201d). The IAIS standards address a variety of topics regarding supervision, coordination of regulators, insurance capital standards, risk management and governance. While the IAIS standards do not have legal effect, the states and the NAIC are implementing various group supervision regulatory tools and mandates that are responsive to certain IAIS standards. U.S. state regulators have formed supervisory colleges intended to promote communication and cooperation amongst the various domestic and international insurance regulators. The Nebraska Department of Insurance acts as the lead supervisor for our group of insurance companies and chairs the Berkshire supervisory college. U.S. state regulators now require insurance groups to file an annual report, the Own Risk Solvency Assessment or ORSA, with the group\u2019s lead supervisor. The NAIC recently adopted a group capital calculation based on methodology similar to the Aggregation Method, which leverages the NAIC\u2019s existing Risk Based Capital standards. The NAIC\u2019s group capital calculation is a tool designed to help the lead supervisor understand the capital adequacy across an insurance group. The NAIC is also developing further tools, including various liquidity assessments, that will likely be imposed on insurance groups in the near future. \n\n\nBerkshire\u2019s insurance companies maintain capital strength at exceptionally high levels, which differentiates them from their competitors. Collectively, the combined statutory surplus of Berkshire\u2019s U.S.-based insurers was approximately $301 billion at December\u00a031, 2021. Berkshire\u2019s major insurance subsidiaries are rated AA+ by Standard\u00a0& Poor\u2019s and A++ (superior) by A.M. Best with respect to their financial condition and claims paying ability. \n\n\nThe Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 established within the Department of the Treasury a Terrorism Insurance Program (\u201cProgram\u201d) for commercial property and casualty insurers by providing federal reinsurance of insured terrorism losses. The Program currently extends to December\u00a031, 2027 through other Acts, most recently the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019. Hereinafter these Acts are collectively referred to as TRIA. Under TRIA, the Department of the Treasury is charged with certifying \u201cacts of terrorism.\u201d Coverage under TRIA occurs if the industry insured loss for certified events occurring during the calendar year exceeds $200\u00a0million in any calendar year. \n\n\nTo be eligible for federal reinsurance, insurers must make available insurance coverage for acts of terrorism, by providing policyholders with clear and conspicuous notice of the amount of premium that will be charged for this coverage and of the federal share of any insured losses resulting from any act of terrorism. Assumed reinsurance is specifically excluded from TRIA participation. TRIA currently also excludes certain forms of direct insurance (such as personal and commercial auto, burglary, theft, surety and certain professional liability lines). Reinsurers are not required to offer terrorism coverage and are not eligible for federal reinsurance of terrorism losses. \n\n\nK-2\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn\n the event of a certified act of terrorism, the federal government will reimburse insurers (conditioned on their satisfaction of policyholder notification requirements) for 80% of their insured losses \nin excess of\n an insurance group\u2019s deductible. Under the Program, the deductible is 20% of the aggregate direct subject earned premium for relevant commercial lines of business in the immediately preceding calendar year. The aggregate deductible in 2022 for Berkshire\u2019s insurance group is expected to \napproximate $\n1.6\n\u00a0billion\n. There is also an aggregate program limit of $100\u00a0billion on the amount of the federal government coverage for each TRIA year. \n\n\nThe extent of insurance regulation varies significantly among the countries in which our non-U.S. operations conduct business. While each country imposes licensing, solvency, auditing and financial reporting requirements, the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nin some countries, insurers are required to prepare and file monthly and/or quarterly financial reports, and in others, only annual reports;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nsome regulators require intermediaries to be involved in the sale of insurance products, whereas other regulators permit direct sales contact between the insurer and the customer;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe extent of restrictions imposed upon an insurer\u2019s use of local and offshore reinsurance vary;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\npolicy form filing and rate regulation vary by country;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe frequency of contact and periodic on-site examinations by insurance authorities differ by country; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe scope and prescriptive requirements of an insurer\u2019s risk management and governance framework vary significantly by country; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nregulatory requirements relating to insurer dividend policies vary by country.\n\n\nSignificant variations can also be found in the size, structure and resources of the local regulatory departments that oversee insurance activities. Certain regulators prefer close relationships with all subject insurers and others operate a risk-based approach.\n\n\nBerkshire\u2019s insurance group operates in some countries through subsidiaries and in some countries through branches of subsidiaries. Berkshire insurance subsidiaries are located in several countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d), Ireland, Australia and South Africa, and also maintain branches in several other countries. Most of these foreign jurisdictions impose local capital requirements. Other legal requirements include discretionary licensing procedures, local retention of funds and records, and data privacy and protection program requirements. Berkshire\u2019s international insurance companies are also subject to multinational application of certain U.S. laws.\n\n\nThere are various regulatory bodies and initiatives that impact Berkshire in multiple international jurisdictions and the potential for significant effect on the Berkshire insurance group could be heightened as a result of recent industry and economic developments.\n\n\nIn 2016, the U.K. voted in a national referendum to withdraw from the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) (\u201cBrexit\u201d), which resulted in the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020. In anticipation of the U.K. leaving the EU, Berkshire Hathaway European Insurance DAC in Ireland was established to permit property and casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses to continue to operate in the EU, and Berkshire continues to maintain a substantial presence in London following Brexit.\n\n\nBerkshire\u2019s insurance underwriting operations include the following groups: (1)\u00a0GEICO, (2) Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and (3)\u00a0Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Except for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity products that generate significant amounts of up-front premiums along with estimated claims expected to be paid over long time periods (creating \u201cfloat,\u201d see Investments section), Berkshire expects to achieve an underwriting profit over time and to reject inadequately priced risks. Underwriting profit is defined as earned premiums less associated incurred losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting and policy acquisition expenses. Underwriting profit does not include income earned from investments. Additional information related to each of Berkshire\u2019s underwriting groups follows. \n\n\nGEICO\n\u2014GEICO is headquartered in Chevy Chase, Maryland. GEICO\u2019s insurance subsidiaries consist of Government Employees Insurance Company, GEICO General Insurance Company, GEICO Indemnity Company, GEICO Casualty Company, GEICO Advantage Insurance Company, GEICO Choice Insurance Company, GEICO Secure Insurance Company, GEICO County Mutual Insurance Company, GEICO Texas County Mutual Insurance Company and GEICO Marine Insurance Company. The GEICO companies primarily offer private passenger automobile insurance to individuals in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO also provides insurance for motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles, recreational vehicles, boats and small commercial fleets and acts as an agent for other insurers who offer homeowners, renters, life and identity management insurance to individuals who desire insurance coverages other than those offered by GEICO. \n\n\nK-3\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGEICO\u2019s marketing is primarily through direct response methods in which applications for insurance are submitted directly to the companies via the Internet or by telephone, and to a lesser extent, through captive agents. GEICO conducts business through regional service centers and claims adjustment and other facilities in 39 states. \n\n\nThe automobile insurance business is highly competitive in the areas of price and service. GEICO competes for private passenger automobile insurance customers in the preferred, standard and non-standard risk markets with other companies that sell directly to the customer and with companies that use agency sales forces, including State Farm, Allstate, Progressive and USAA. GEICO\u2019s advertising campaigns and competitive rates contributed to a cumulative increase in voluntary policies-in-force of approximately 26.0% over the past five years. According to the most recently published A.M. Best data for 2020, the five largest automobile insurers had a combined market share in 2020 of approximately 59.7% based on written premiums, with GEICO\u2019s market share being the second largest at approximately 13.5%. GEICO\u2019s written premiums in 2020 were reduced by the effects of the GEICO Giveback Program implemented in response to significant reductions in claim frequencies attributable to reduced policyholder driving during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pandemic-related premium credit programs of other private passenger insurers may not have been reported as premium reductions, which impacts the industry data reported by A.M Best. Since the publication of that data, GEICO\u2019s management estimates its current market share is approximately 14.2%. Seasonal variations in GEICO\u2019s insurance business are not significant. However, extraordinary weather conditions or other factors may have a significant effect upon the frequency or severity of automobile claims. \n\n\nState insurance departments stringently regulate private passenger auto insurance. As a result, it is difficult for insurance companies to differentiate their products. Competition for private passenger automobile insurance, which is substantial, tends to focus on price and level of customer service provided. GEICO\u2019s cost-efficient direct response marketing methods and emphasis on customer satisfaction enable it to offer competitive rates and value to its customers. GEICO primarily uses its own claims staff to manage and settle claims. The name and reputation of GEICO are material assets and management protects those and other service marks through appropriate registrations. \n\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Primary Group\n\u2014The Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (\u201cBH Primary\u201d) is a collection of independently managed insurers that provide a wide variety of insurance coverages to policyholders located principally in the United States. These various operations are discussed below. \n\n\nNational Indemnity Company (\u201cNICO\u201d), domiciled in Nebraska, and certain affiliates (\u201cNICO Primary\u201d) underwrite commercial motor vehicle and general liability insurance on an admitted basis and on an excess and surplus basis. Insurance coverages are offered nationwide primarily through insurance agents and brokers. \n\n\nThe Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (\u201cBHHC\u201d) is a group of insurers offering workers\u2019 compensation, commercial auto and commercial property coverages to a diverse client base. BHHC has a national reach, with the ability to provide first-dollar and small to large deductible workers\u2019 compensation coverage to employers in all states, except those where coverage is available only through state-operated workers\u2019 compensation funds. NICO Primary and BHHC are each based in Omaha, Nebraska. \n\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (\u201cBH Specialty\u201d) offers commercial property, casualty, healthcare professional liability, executive and professional, surety, travel, medical stop loss and homeowner\u2019s insurance through Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance Company and other Berkshire insurance affiliates. BH Specialty writes primary and excess policies on an admitted and surplus basis in the U.S., and on a local or foreign non-admitted basis outside the U.S. BH Specialty is based in Boston, Massachusetts, with regional offices currently in several U.S. cities. BH Specialty also maintains international offices located in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and several countries in Asia, Europe and the Middle East. BH Specialty writes business through wholesale and retail insurance brokers, as well as managing general agents. \n\n\nMedPro Group (\u201cMedPro\u201d) is a leading provider of healthcare liability (\u201cHCL\u201d) insurance in the United States. MedPro provides customized HCL insurance, claims, patient safety and risk solutions to physicians, surgeons, dentists and other healthcare professionals, as well as hospitals, senior care and other healthcare facilities. Additionally, MedPro provides HCL insurance solutions to international markets through other Berkshire insurance affiliates, delivers liability insurance to other professionals, and offers specialized accident and health insurance solutions to colleges and other customers through its subsidiaries and other Berkshire insurance affiliates. MedPro is based in Fort Wayne, Indiana. \n\n\nU.S. Liability Insurance Company (\u201cUSLI\u201d) includes a group of five specialty insurers that underwrite commercial, professional and personal lines insurance on an admitted basis, as well as on an excess and surplus basis. USLI markets policies in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Canada through wholesale and retail insurance agents. USLI companies also underwrite and market a wide variety of specialty insurance products. USLI is based in Wayne, Pennsylvania. \n\n\nK-4\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBerkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies (\u201cGUARD\u201d) is a group of five insurance companies that provide \na full suite of commercial insurance products\n,\n \nas well as\n homeowners \npolicies\n to over 350,000 small \nto\n mid-sized businesses\n and homeowners\n. \nThese offerings are made\n through independent agents and retail and wholesale brokers. GUARD is based in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. \n\n\nMLMIC Insurance Company (\u201cMLMIC\u201d) has been the leading writer of medical professional liability insurance in New York State for over 40 years. MLMIC distributes the majority of its policies on a direct basis to medical and dental professionals, health care providers and hospitals. \n\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group\n\u2014Berkshire\u2019s combined global reinsurance business, referred to as the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (\u201cBHRG\u201d), offers a wide range of coverages on property, casualty, life and health risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide. BHRG conducts business activities in 24 countries. Reinsurance business is written through NICO and certain other Berkshire insurance subsidiaries (collectively, the \u201cNICO Group\u201d) and General Re Corporation, domiciled in Delaware, and its subsidiaries (collectively the \u201cGeneral Re Group\u201d). BHRG\u2019s underwriting operations in the U.S. are based in Stamford, Connecticut. \n\n\nThe type and volume of business written is dependent on market conditions, including prevailing premium rates and coverage terms. The level of underwriting activities often fluctuates significantly from year to year depending on the perceived level of price adequacy in specific insurance and reinsurance markets as well as from the timing of particularly large reinsurance transactions. \n\n\nProperty/casualty \n\n\nThe NICO Group offers traditional property/casualty reinsurance on both an excess-of-loss and a quota-share basis, catastrophe excess-of-loss treaty and facultative reinsurance, and primary insurance on an excess-of-loss basis for large or unusual risks. The type and volume of business written by the NICO Group may vary significantly from period to period resulting from changes in perceived premium rate adequacy and from unique or large transactions. A significant portion of NICO Group\u2019s annual reinsurance premium volume currently derives from a 20% quota-share agreement with Insurance Australia Group Limited (\u201cIAG\u201d) that expires July\u00a01, 2025. IAG is a multi-line insurer in Australia, New Zealand and other Asia-Pacific countries.\n\n\nThe General Re Group conducts a global property and casualty reinsurance business. Reinsurance contracts are written on both a quota-share and excess basis for multiple lines of business. Contracts are primarily in the form of treaties, and to a lesser degree, on a facultative basis. General Re Group conducts business in North America primarily through General Reinsurance Corporation (\u201cGRC\u201d), which is licensed in the District of Columbia and all states, except Hawaii, where it is an accredited reinsurer. GRC conducts operations in North America from its headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut and through 12 branch offices in the U.S. and Canada. \n\n\nIn North America, the General Re Group includes General Star National Insurance Company, General Star Indemnity Company and Genesis Insurance Company, which offer a broad array of specialty and surplus lines and property, casualty and professional liability coverages. Such business is marketed through a select group of wholesale brokers, managing general underwriters and program administrators, and offer solutions for the unique needs of public entity, commercial and captive customers. \n\n\nGeneral Re Group\u2019s international reinsurance business is conducted on a direct basis through General Reinsurance AG, based in Cologne, Germany, and through several other subsidiaries and branches in numerous other countries. International business is also written through brokers, including Faraday Underwriting Limited (\u201cFaraday\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary. Faraday owns the managing agent of Syndicate 435 at Lloyd\u2019s of London and provides capacity and participates in 100% of the results of Syndicate 435. \n\n\nLife/health \n\n\nThe General Re Group also conducts a global life and health reinsurance business. In the U.S. and internationally, the General Re Group writes life, disability, supplemental health, critical illness and long-term care coverages. The life/health business is marketed on a direct basis. Life/health net premiums written by the General Re Group in 2021 were primarily in the Asia Pacific, United States and Western Europe. \n\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (\u201cBHLN\u201d), a subsidiary of NICO, and its affiliates write reinsurance covering various forms of traditional life insurance exposures and, on a limited basis, health insurance exposures. BHLN and affiliates are parties to contracts that reinsure certain guaranteed minimum death, income and similar benefit risks on closed-blocks of variable annuity risks under reinsurance contracts, with the most recent contract incepting in 2014. \n\n\nK-5\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRetroactive reinsurance \n\n\nNICO also periodically writes retroactive reinsurance contracts. Retroactive reinsurance contracts indemnify ceding companies against the adverse development of claims arising from loss events that have already occurred under property and casualty policies issued in prior years. Coverages under such contracts are provided on an excess basis (above a stated retention) or for losses payable after the inception of the contract with no additional ceding company retention. Contracts are normally subject to aggregate limits of indemnification, which can be exceptionally large in amount. Significant amounts of asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims may arise under these contracts. \n\n\nThe concept of time-value-of-money is an important element in establishing retroactive reinsurance contract prices and terms since loss payments may occur over decades. Normally, expected ultimate losses payable under these policies are expected to exceed premiums, thus producing underwriting losses. Nevertheless, this business is written, in part, because of the large amounts of policyholder funds generated for investment, the economic benefit of which will be reflected through investment results in future periods. \n\n\nPeriodic payment annuity \n\n\nBHLN writes periodic payment annuity insurance policies and reinsures existing annuity-like obligations. Under these policies, BHLN receives upfront premiums and agrees in the future to make periodic payments that often extend for decades. These policies generally relate to the settlement of underlying personal injury or workers\u2019 compensation cases of other insurers, known as structured settlements. Consistent with retroactive reinsurance contracts, time-value-of-money concepts are an important factor in establishing annuity premiums, and underwriting losses are expected from the periodic accretion of time-value discounted liabilities. \n\n\nInvestments of insurance businesses\n\u2014Berkshire\u2019s insurance subsidiaries hold significant levels of invested assets. Investment portfolios are primarily managed by Berkshire\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. Investments include a very large portfolio of publicly traded equity securities, which are concentrated in relatively few issuers, as well as fixed maturity securities and cash and short-term investments. Generally, there are no targeted allocations by investment type or attempts to match investment asset and insurance liability durations. However, investment portfolios have historically included a much greater proportion of equity securities than is customary in the insurance industry. \n\n\nInvested assets derive from shareholder capital as well as funds provided from policyholders through insurance and reinsurance business (\u201cfloat\u201d). Float is the approximate amount of net policyholder funds generated through underwriting activities that is available for investment. The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other policyholder liabilities less premium and reinsurance receivables, deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred charges on assumed retroactive reinsurance contracts. On a consolidated basis, float has grown from approximately $91\u00a0billion at the end of 2016 to approximately $147\u00a0billion at the end of 2021. The cost of float can be measured as the net pre-tax underwriting loss as a percentage of average float. In each of the three years ending December 31, 2021, Berkshire\u2019s consolidated cost of float was negative, as its insurance businesses produced net underwriting gains. \n\n\nRailroad Business\u2014Burlington Northern Santa Fe \n\n\nBurlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (\u201cBNSF\u201d) is based in Fort Worth, Texas, and through BNSF Railway Company (\u201cBNSF Railway\u201d) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America. BNSF Railway had approximately 35,000 employees at the end of 2021. BNSF also operates a relatively smaller third-party logistics services business.\n\n\nIn serving the Midwest, Pacific Northwest, Western, Southwestern and Southeastern regions and ports of the United States, BNSF transports a range of products and commodities derived from manufacturing, agricultural and natural resource industries. Freight revenues are covered by contractual agreements of varying durations or common carrier published prices or company quotations. BNSF\u2019s financial performance is influenced by, among other things, general and industry economic conditions at the international, national and regional levels. \n\n\nBNSF\u2019s primary routes, including trackage rights, allow it to access major cities and ports in the western and southern United States as well as parts of Canada and Mexico. In addition to major cities and ports, BNSF Railway efficiently serves many smaller markets by working closely with approximately 200 shortline railroads. BNSF Railway has also entered into marketing agreements with other rail carriers, expanding the marketing reach for each railroad and their customers. For the year ending December\u00a031, 2021, approximately 38% of freight revenues were derived from consumer products, 24% from industrial products, 23% from agricultural products and 15% from coal. \n\n\nK-6\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRegulatory Matters \n\n\nBNSF is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to its businesses. Rail operations are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (\u201cSTB\u201d), the Federal Railroad Administration of the United States Department of Transportation (\u201cDOT\u201d), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d), as well as other federal and state regulatory agencies and Canadian regulatory agencies for operations in Canada. The STB has jurisdiction over disputes and complaints involving certain rates, routes and services, the sale or abandonment of rail lines, applications for line extensions and construction, and the merger with or acquisition of control of rail common carriers. The outcome of STB proceedings can affect the profitability of BNSF Railway\u2019s business. \n\n\nThe DOT and OSHA have jurisdiction under several federal statutes over a number of safety and health aspects of rail operations, including the transportation of hazardous materials. BNSF Railway is required to transport these materials to the extent of its common carrier obligation. State agencies regulate some aspects of rail operations with respect to health and safety in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law. \n\n\nEnvironmental Matters \n\n\nBNSF\u2019s rail operations, as well as those of its competitors, are also subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental regulation covering discharges to the ground or waters, air emissions, toxic substances and the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials. Such regulations effectively increase the costs and liabilities associated with rail operations. Environmental risks are also inherent in rail operations, which frequently involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials. \n\n\nMany of BNSF\u2019s land holdings are or have been used for industrial or transportation-related purposes or leased to commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property. Under federal (in particular, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act) and state statutes, BNSF may be held jointly and severally liable for cleanup and enforcement costs associated with a particular site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. BNSF may also be subject to claims by third parties for investigation, cleanup, restoration or other environmental costs under environmental statutes or common law with respect to properties they own that have been impacted by BNSF operations. \n\n\nConsumption of diesel fuel by locomotives accounted for approximately 80% of BNSF\u2019s greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions in its baseline year of 2018. BNSF management has committed to a broad sustainability model, applying science-based approaches, that will provide a 30% reduction in BNSF\u2019s GHG-emissions by 2030 from its baseline year of 2018. BNSF intends to continue improvements in fuel efficiency and increased utilization of renewable diesel fuel. Long-term solutions, such as battery-electric and hydrogen locomotives, are also being evaluated and field-tested.\n\n\nCompetition \n\n\nThe business environment in which BNSF operates is highly competitive. Depending on the specific market, deregulated motor carriers and other railroads, as well as river barges, ships and pipelines, may exert pressure on price and service levels. The presence of advanced, high service truck lines with expedited delivery, subsidized infrastructure and minimal empty mileage continues to affect the market for non-bulk, time-sensitive freight. The potential expansion of longer combination vehicles could further encroach upon markets traditionally served by railroads. In order to remain competitive, BNSF Railway and other railroads seek to develop and implement operating efficiencies to improve productivity. \n\n\nAs railroads streamline, rationalize and otherwise enhance their franchises, competition among rail carriers intensifies. BNSF Railway\u2019s primary rail competitor in the Western region of the United States is the Union Pacific Railroad Company. Other Class\u00a0I railroads and numerous regional railroads and motor carriers also operate in parts of the same territories served by BNSF Railway. \n\n\nUtilities and Energy Businesses\u2014Berkshire Hathaway Energy \n\n\nBerkshire currently has a 91.1% ownership interest in Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (\u201cBHE\u201d).

The distribution companies primarily charge supply companies regulated tariffs for the use of their distribution systems. \n\n\nAltaLink L.P. (\u201cAltaLink\u201d) is a regulated electric transmission-only utility company headquartered in Calgary, Alberta. AltaLink\u2019s high voltage transmission lines and related facilities transmit electricity from generating facilities to major load centers, cities and large industrial plants throughout its 87,000 square mile service territory. \n\n\nThe natural gas pipelines consist of BHE GT&S, LLC (\u201cBHE GT&S\u201d), Northern Natural Gas Company (\u201cNorthern Natural\u201d) and Kern River Gas Transmission Company (\u201cKern River\u201d). BHE GT&S was acquired on November 1, 2020.\n\n\nBHE GT&S, based in Virginia, operates three interstate natural gas pipeline systems that consist of approximately 5,400 miles of natural gas transmission, gathering and storage pipelines and operates seventeen underground natural gas storage fields in the eastern region of the United States. BHE GT&S\u2019s large underground natural gas storage assets and pipeline systems are part of an interconnected gas transmission network that provides transportation services to utilities and numerous other customers. BHE GT&S is also an industry leader in liquefied natural gas solutions through its investments in and ownership of several liquefied natural gas facilities located throughout the eastern region of the United States.\n\n\nNorthern Natural, based in Nebraska, operates the largest interstate natural gas pipeline system in the United States, as measured by pipeline miles, reaching from west Texas to Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula. Northern Natural\u2019s pipeline system consists of approximately 14,300 miles of natural gas pipelines. Northern Natural\u2019s extensive pipeline system, which is interconnected with many interstate and intrastate pipelines in the national grid system, has access to supplies from multiple major supply basins and provides transportation services to utilities and numerous other customers. Northern Natural also operates three underground natural gas storage facilities and two liquefied natural gas storage peaking units. Northern Natural\u2019s pipeline system experiences significant seasonal swings in demand and revenue, with the highest demand typically occurring during the months of November through March. \n\n\nKern River, based in Utah, operates an interstate natural gas pipeline system that consists of approximately 1,400 miles and extends from supply areas in the Rocky Mountains to consuming markets in Utah, Nevada and California. Kern River transports natural gas for electric and natural gas distribution utilities, major oil and natural gas companies or affiliates of such companies, electric generating companies, energy marketing and trading companies, and financial institutions. \n\n\nBHE Renewables, based in Iowa, owns interests in independent power projects having approximately 4,900 net megawatts of generation capacity that are in service in California, Texas, Illinois, Nebraska, New York, Arizona, Minnesota, Kansas, Iowa and Hawaii. These independent power projects sell power generated primarily from wind, solar, geothermal and hydro sources under long-term contracts. Additionally, $6.9\u00a0billion has been invested in wind projects sponsored by third parties, commonly referred to as tax equity investments. \n\n\nK-8\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRegulatory Matters \n\n\nPacifiCorp, MEC and the Nevada Utilities are subject to comprehensive regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\u201cFERC\u201d) is an independent agency with broad authority to implement provisions of the Federal Power Act, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and other federal statutes. The FERC regulates rates for wholesale sales of electricity; transmission of electricity, including pricing and regional planning for the expansion of transmission systems; electric system reliability; utility holding companies; accounting and records retention; securities issuances; construction and operation of hydroelectric facilities; and other matters. The FERC also has the enforcement authority to assess civil penalties of up to $1.4\u00a0million per day per violation of rules, regulations and orders issued under the Federal Power Act. MEC is also subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, with respect to its 25% ownership of the Quad Cities Nuclear Station. \n\n\nWith certain limited exceptions, BHE\u2019s domestic utilities have an exclusive right to serve retail customers within their service territories and, in turn, have an obligation to provide service to those customers. In some jurisdictions, certain classes of customers may choose to purchase all or a portion of their energy from alternative energy suppliers, and in some jurisdictions retail customers can generate all or a portion of their own energy. Historically, state regulatory commissions have established retail electric and natural gas rates on a cost-of-service basis, designed to allow a utility the opportunity to recover what each state regulatory commission deems to be the utility\u2019s reasonable costs of providing services, including a fair opportunity to earn a reasonable return on its investments based on its cost of debt and equity. The retail electric rates of PacifiCorp, MEC and the Nevada Utilities are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled services, including generation, transmission and distribution services; however, rates are available for transmission-only and distribution-only services. \n\n\nNorthern Powergrid (Northeast) and Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) each charge fees for the use of their distribution systems that are controlled by a formula prescribed by the British electricity regulatory body, the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority. The current eight-year price control period runs from April\u00a01, 2015 through March\u00a031, 2023. \n\n\nAltaLink is regulated by the Alberta Utilities Commission (\u201cAUC\u201d), pursuant to the Electric Utilities Act (Alberta), the Public Utilities Act (Alberta), the Alberta Utilities Commission Act (Alberta) and the Hydro and Electric Energy Act (Alberta). The AUC is an independent quasi-judicial agency, which regulates and oversees Alberta\u2019s electricity transmission sector with broad authority that may impact many of AltaLink\u2019s activities, including its tariffs, rates, construction, operations and financing. Under the Electric Utilities Act, AltaLink prepares and files applications with the AUC for approval of tariffs to be paid by the Alberta Electric System Operator (\u201cAESO\u201d) for the use of its transmission facilities, and the terms and conditions governing the use of those facilities. The AESO is an independent system operator in Alberta, Canada that oversees Alberta\u2019s integrated electrical system (\u201cAIES\u201d) and wholesale electricity market. The AESO is responsible for directing the safe, reliable and economic operation of the AIES, including long-term transmission system planning. \n\n\nThe natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies. The natural gas pipeline and storage operations of BHE GT&S, Northern Natural and Kern River are regulated by the FERC pursuant to the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Under this authority, the FERC regulates, among other items, (a)\u00a0rates, charges, terms and conditions of service; (b)\u00a0the construction and operation of interstate pipelines, storage and related facilities, including the extension, expansion or abandonment of such facilities; and (c) the construction and operation of liquefied natural gas import/export facilities. Interstate natural gas pipeline companies are also subject to regulations administered by the Office of Pipeline Safety within the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, an agency of the DOT. Federal pipeline safety regulations are issued pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, which establishes safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas pipeline facilities. \n\n\nEnvironmental Matters \n\n\nBHE and its energy businesses are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding climate change, renewable portfolio standards, air and water quality, emissions performance standards, coal combustion byproduct disposal, hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected species and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations, such as the Federal Clean Air Act, provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. \n\n\nThe Federal Clean Air Act, as well as state laws and regulations impacting air emissions, provides a framework for protecting and improving the nation\u2019s air quality and controlling sources of air emissions. These laws and regulations continue to be promulgated and implemented and will impact the operation of BHE\u2019s generating facilities and require them to reduce emissions at those facilities to comply with the requirements. \n\n\nK-9\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRenewable portfolio standards have been established by certain state governments and generally require electricity providers to obtain a minimum percentage of their power from renewable energy resources by a certain date. Utah, Oregon, Washington, California, \nIowa\n and Nevada have adopted renewable portfolio standards. In addition, the potential adoption of state or federal clean energy standards, which include low-carbon, non-carbon and renewable electricity generating resources, may also impact electricity generators and natural gas providers. \n\n\nIn December 2015, an international agreement was negotiated by 195 nations to create a universal framework for coordinated action on climate change in what is referred to as the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement reaffirms the goal of limiting global temperature increase well below 2 degrees Celsius, while urging efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius; establishes commitments by all parties to make nationally determined contributions and pursue domestic measures aimed at achieving the commitments; commits all countries to submit emissions inventories and report regularly on their emissions and progress made in implementing and achieving their nationally determined commitments; and commits all countries to submit new commitments every five years, with the expectation that the commitments will get more aggressive. In the context of the Paris Agreement, the United States agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 26% to 28% by 2025 from 2005 levels. The Paris Agreement formally entered into force on November\u00a04, 2016. The United States completed its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on November 4, 2020. President Biden accepted the terms of the climate agreement on January 21, 2021, and the United States completed its reentry on February 19, 2021. New commitments to the Paris Agreement were announced in April 2021, with the United States pledging to cut its overall greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030 and to reach 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035.\n\n\nOn October 10, 2017, the Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) issued a proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan, which was intended to achieve an overall reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil-fueled electric generating units of 32% below 2005 levels. On June 19, 2019, the EPA repealed the Clean Power Plan and issued the Affordable Clean Energy rule, which fully replaced the Clean Power Plan. In the Affordable Clean Energy rule, the EPA determined that the best system of emissions reduction for existing coal fueled power plants is heat rate improvements and identified a set of candidate technologies and measures that could improve heat rates. Measures taken to meet the standards of performance must be achieved at the source itself. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the Affordable Clean Energy Rule in its entirety. In October 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal of that decision. Arguments in the case will be held in February 2022 and a decision regarding the scope of the EPA\u2019s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act is expected by June 2022. Increasingly, states are adopting legislation and regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and local governments and consumers are seeking increasing amounts of clean and renewable energy. \n\n\nBHE and its energy subsidiaries continue to focus on delivering reliable, affordable, safe and clean energy to its customers and on actions to mitigate its greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions. BHE\u2019s primary source of GHG emissions is the generation of electricity from its power plants that are fueled by coal or natural gas. In managing its electricity generation, BHE works with its regulators to protect the energy and economic needs of customers by considering costs, reliability and sources of electric generation. Over the years, BHE has invested heavily in owned wind, solar and geothermal generation, with cumulative investments of $30.1 billion through 2021 and has retired 16 coal generation units. As a result, BHE has reduced its annual GHG emissions by about 20% from 2005 levels. BHE plans to continue investing in wind, solar and other low-carbon generation in the future and to retire an additional 16 coal generation units between 2022 and 2030 in a reliable and cost-effective manner, thereby achieving a 50% reduction in GHG emissions from 2005 levels in 2030. \n\n\nNon-Energy Businesses \n\n\nHomeServices of America, Inc. (\u201cHomeServices\u201d) is the largest residential real estate brokerage firm in the United States. In addition to providing traditional residential real estate brokerage services, HomeServices offers other integrated real estate services, including mortgage originations and mortgage banking, title and closing services, property and casualty insurance, home warranties, relocation services and other home-related services.

This business is highly competitive and subject to general real estate market conditions. \n\n\nK-10\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManufacturing Businesses \n\n\nBerkshire\u2019s numerous and diverse manufacturing subsidiaries are grouped into three categories: (1)\u00a0industrial products, (2)\u00a0building products and (3)\u00a0consumer products. Berkshire\u2019s industrial products businesses manufacture components for aerospace and power generation applications, specialty chemicals, metal cutting tools, and a variety of other products primarily for industrial use. The building products group produces prefabricated and site-built residential homes, flooring products, insulation, roofing and engineered products, building and engineered components, paint and coatings and bricks and masonry products. The consumer products group manufactures recreational vehicles, alkaline batteries, various apparel products, jewelry and custom picture framing products. Information concerning the major activities of these three groups follows. Berkshire\u2019s manufacturing businesses employed approximately 187,000 people at the end of 2021.\n\n\nIndustrial products \n\n\nPrecision Castparts \n\n\nPrecision Castparts Corp. (\u201cPCC\u201d) manufactures complex metal components and products, provides high-quality investment castings, forgings, fasteners/fastener systems and aerostructures for critical aerospace and power and energy applications. PCC also manufactures seamless pipe for coal-fired, industrial gas turbine (\u201cIGT\u201d) and nuclear power plants; downhole casing and tubing, fittings and various mill forms in a variety of nickel and steel alloys for severe-service oil and gas environments; investment castings and forgings for general industrial, armament, medical and other applications; nickel and titanium alloys in all standard mill forms from large ingots and billets to plate, foil, sheet, strip, tubing, bar, rod, extruded shapes, rod-in-coil, wire and welding consumables, as well as cobalt alloys, for the aerospace, chemical processing, oil and gas, pollution control and other industries; revert management solutions; fasteners for automotive and general industrial markets; specialty alloys for the investment casting and forging industries; heat treating and destructive testing services for the investment cast products and forging industries; grinder pumps and affiliated components for low-pressure sewer systems; critical auxiliary equipment and gas monitoring systems for the power generation industry; and metalworking tools for the fastener market and other applications. \n\n\nInvestment casting technology involves a multi-step process that uses ceramic molds in the manufacture of metal components with more complex shapes, closer tolerances and finer surface finishes than parts manufactured using other methods. PCC uses this process to manufacture products for aircraft engines, IGT and other aeroderivative engines, airframes, medical implants, armament, unmanned aerial vehicles and other industrial applications. PCC also manufactures high temperature carbon and ceramic composite components, including ceramic matrix composites, for use in next-generation aerospace engines. \n\n\nPCC uses forging processes to manufacture components for the aerospace and power generation markets, including seamless pipe for coal-fired, IGT and nuclear power plants, and downhole casings and tubing pipe for severe service oil and gas markets. PCC manufactures high-performance, nickel-based alloys used to produce forged components for aerospace and non-aerospace applications in such markets as oil and gas, chemical processing and pollution control. These titanium products are used to manufacture components for the commercial and military aerospace, power generation, energy and other industrial end markets. \n\n\nPCC is also a leading developer and manufacturer of highly engineered fasteners, fastener systems, aerostructures and precision components, primarily for critical aerospace applications. These products are produced for the aerospace and power and energy markets, as well as for construction, automotive, heavy truck, farm machinery, mining and construction equipment, shipbuilding, machine tools, medical equipment, appliance and recreation markets. \n\n\nPCC has several significant customers, including aerospace original equipment manufacturers (Boeing and Airbus) and aircraft engine manufacturer suppliers (General Electric, Rolls Royce and Pratt &Whitney). The majority of PCC\u2019s sales are from customer orders or demand schedules pursuant to long-term agreements. Contractual terms may provide for termination by the customer, subject to payment for work performed. PCC typically does not experience significant order cancellations, although periodically it receives requests for delays in delivery schedules. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, delay requests increased, with delivery dates extending in some cases beyond 2021. \n\n\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic produced significant adverse effects on the PCC aerospace business in 2020 and 2021. The sudden and material reductions in air travel led to aircraft build rate reductions and customer destocking at extraordinary rates. The grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX also adversely impacted 2020 and 2021 and quality issues with the Boeing 787 negatively impacted 2021. Aircraft build rates have not recovered in any meaningful way. During 2020, PCC significantly reduced its worldwide workforce by about 40% to help align operations to reduced aircraft build rates. The restructuring actions taken began to improve margins in late 2020 and further margin improvements were achieved in 2021.\n\n\nK-11\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPCC is subject to substantial competition in all of its markets. Components and similar products may be produced by competitors, who use either the same types of manufacturing processes as PCC or other processes. Although PCC believes its manufacturing processes, technology and experience provide advantages to its customers, such as high quality, competitive prices and physical properties that often meet more stringent demands, alternative forms of manufacturing can be used to produce many of the same components and products. Despite intense competition, PCC is a leading supplier in most of its principal markets. Several factors, including long-standing customer relationships, technical expertise, state-of-the-art facilities and dedicated employees, aid PCC in maintaining competitive advantages. \n\n\nSeveral raw materials used in PCC products, including certain metals such as nickel, titanium, cobalt, tantalum and molybdenum, are found in only a few parts of the world. These metals are required for the alloys used in manufactured products. The availability and costs of these metals may be influenced by private or governmental cartels, changes in world politics, labor relations between the metal producers and their workforces and inflation. \n\n\nPCC is currently subject to various federal, state and foreign environmental laws concerning, among other things, water discharges, air emissions, waste management, toxic materials use reduction and environmental cleanup. Laws and regulations continue to evolve, and it is reasonably possible that environmental standards will become more stringent in the future, particularly under air quality and water quality laws and standards related to climate change, including reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, it is also reasonably likely that PCC will be regularly required to make additional expenditures, including capital expenditures, which could be significant, relating to environmental matters. \n\n\nLubrizol \n\n\nThe Lubrizol Corporation (\u201cLubrizol\u201d) is a specialty chemical and performance materials company that manufactures products and supplies technologies for the global transportation, industrial and consumer markets.

Lubrizol also leverages its scientific and applications knowledge to meet and exceed customer performance and sustainability requirements. While Lubrizol typically has patents that expire each year, it invests resources to protect its intellectual property and to develop or acquire innovative products for the markets it serves. Lubrizol uses many specialty and commodity chemical raw materials in its manufacturing processes. Raw materials are primarily feedstocks derived from petroleum and petrochemicals and, generally, are obtainable from several sources. The materials that Lubrizol chooses to purchase from a single source typically are subject to long-term supply contracts to ensure supply reliability. \n\n\nLubrizol operates its business on a global basis through more than 100 offices, laboratories, production facilities and warehouses on six continents, the most significant of which are North America, Europe, Asia and South America. Lubrizol markets its products worldwide through direct sales, sales agents and distributors. Lubrizol\u2019s customers principally consist of major global and regional oil companies and industrial and consumer products companies. Some of Lubrizol\u2019s largest customers also may be suppliers. During 2021, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of Lubrizol\u2019s consolidated revenues. In 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to have an adverse effect on many of the markets that Lubrizol serves, as did worldwide supply chain disruptions, affecting both the availability of raw materials and fulfillment of customer orders. In addition, the occurrence and duration of the February 2021 winter storms and freezing temperatures in Texas significantly interrupted operations at Lubrizol\u2019s manufacturing facilities. \n\n\nLubrizol expends significant capital to ensure the safety of its employees and the communities where it operates, as well as delivering on its commitments to operational excellence and cybersecurity. Lubrizol also makes significant capital investments to ensure reliable supply and compliance with regulations governing its operations, while reducing their environmental footprint. \n\n\nK-12\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLubrizol is subject to foreign, federal, \nstate\n and local laws to protect the environment, limit manufacturing waste and emissions, ensure product and employee safety and regulate trade. While the company believes that its policies, \npractices\n and procedures are designed to limit the risks of non-compliance with laws and consequent financial liability, it experienced \na fire\n at \none\n of its chemical manufacturing facilities in 2019, which resulted in significant cleanup and remediation costs. \nLubrizol also suffered a fire in 2021 that resulted in a total loss of its grease manufacturing facility. \nThe operation of chemical manufacturing plants entails ongoing environmental and other risks, and significant capital expenditures, costs or liabilities could be incurred in the future. \n\n\nIMC \n\n\nIMC International Metalworking Companies (\u201cIMC\u201d) is one of the world\u2019s three largest multinational manufacturers of consumable precision carbide metal cutting tools for applications in a broad range of industrial end markets.

As of December 2021, off-site backlog was $1.4 billion, up 10% from the prior year. Clayton sells its homes through independent and company-owned home centers, realtors and subdivision channels. Clayton considers its ability to make financing available to retail purchasers a factor affecting the market acceptance of its off-site built homes. Clayton\u2019s financing programs utilize proprietary loan underwriting guidelines to evaluate loan applicants, which include ability to repay calculations, including debt to income limits, and incorporate residual income and credit score requirements.\n\n\nSince 2015, Clayton\u2019s site-built division, Clayton Properties Group, has expanded through the acquisition of nine builders across 14 states with over 300 subdivisions, supplementing the portfolio of housing products offered to customers. Clayton\u2019s site-builders currently own and control approximately 83,000 homesites, with a home order backlog of approximately $2.5 billion.\n\n\nHistorically, access to key inputs such as lumber, steel and resin products has been adequate. During 2021, the availability and pricing of these and other inputs has been volatile. Input shortages coupled with labor and subcontractor availability have increased the time to construct a home, constraining our ability to meet current demand. \n\n\nClayton\u2019s home building business regularly makes capital and non-capital expenditures with respect to compliance with federal, state and local environmental regulations, primarily related to erosion control, permitting and stormwater protection for site-built home subdivisions.

Shaw\u2019s wholesale products are marketed domestically by over 2,100 salaried and commissioned sales personnel directly to retailers and distributors and to large national accounts. Shaw\u2019s seven carpet, nine hard surface, one sample full-service distribution facility, three sample satellite locations and 30 redistribution centers, along with centralized management information systems, enable it to provide prompt and efficient delivery of its products to both its retail customers and wholesale distributors. \n\n\nSubstantially all carpet manufactured by Shaw is tufted carpet made from nylon, polypropylene and polyester. In the tufting process, yarn is inserted by multiple needles into a synthetic backing, forming loops, which may be cut or left uncut, depending on the desired texture or construction. During 2021, Shaw processed approximately 97% of its requirements for carpet yarn in its own yarn processing facilities. The availability of raw materials is adequate, but costs are impacted by petro-chemical and natural gas price changes. Raw material cost changes are periodically factored into selling prices to customers. \n\n\nThe soft floor covering industry is highly competitive with only a handful of key players domestically where the majority of Shaw\u2019s business occurs. There are numerous manufacturers, domestically and internationally, that are engaged in hard surface floor covering production, distribution and sales. According to industry estimates, carpet accounts for approximately 44% of the total United States consumption of all flooring types. The principal competitive measures within the floor covering industry are quality, style, price and service. \n\n\nJohns Manville \n\n\nJohns Manville Corporation (\u201cJM\u201d), headquartered in Denver, Colorado, is a leading manufacturer and marketer of premium-quality products for building insulation, mechanical and industrial insulation, commercial roofing and roof insulation, as well as fibers and nonwovens for commercial, industrial and residential applications.

Competitors include other paint and decorating stores, mass merchandisers, home centers, independent hardware stores, hardware chains and manufacturer-operated direct outlets, such as Sherwin-Williams Company, PPG Industries, Inc., The Valspar Corporation, The Home Depot, Inc. and Lowe\u2019s Companies, Inc. \n\n\nThe most significant raw materials in Benjamin Moore products are titanium dioxide, monomers, polymers and pigments. Historically, these materials have been generally available, with pricing and availability subject to fluctuation. In 2021, raw material supply constraints and increased customer demand for products prevailed and disrupted Benjamin Moore\u2019s ability to build inventory. A major winter storm that impacted the Gulf Coast region of the United States in February of 2021 caused substantial supply chain disruptions for Benjamin Moore, which contributed to significant inflation in manufacturing costs. \n\n\nBenjamin Moore undertakes to comply with applicable regulations relating to protection of the environment and workers\u2019 safety and products meet or exceed environmental standards. Benjamin Moore has certain known past environmental matters, which are subject to on-going monitoring and/or remediation efforts. \n\n\nAcme \n\n\nAcme Brick Company (\u201cAcme\u201d), headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, manufactures and distributes clay bricks (Acme Brick\n\u00ae\n) and concrete block (Featherlite). In addition, Acme distributes numerous other building products of other manufacturers, including floor and wall tile, wood flooring and other masonry products. Products are sold primarily in the South Central and Southeastern United States through company-operated sales offices. Acme distributes products primarily to homebuilders and masonry and general contractors. \n\n\nOver the past three years, Acme closed multiple manufacturing and sales facilities. Acme operates 12 clay brick manufacturing sites located in four states, three concrete block facilities and a quarrying operation all located in Texas. The demand for Acme\u2019s products is seasonal, with higher sales in the warmer weather months, and is subject to the level of construction activity, which is cyclical. Acme also owns and leases properties and mineral rights that supply raw materials used in many of its manufactured products. Acme\u2019s raw materials supply is believed to be adequate. \n\n\nK-17\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe brick industry is subject to the EPA Maximum Achievable Control Technology Standards (\u201cMACT\u201d). As required under the 1990 Clean Air Act, the EPA developed a list of source categories that require the development of National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, which are also referred to as MACT Standards (\u201cRule\u201d). Key elements of the MACT Rule include emission limits established for certain hazardous air pollutants and acidic gases. Acme\u2019s brick plants \nare in compliance with\n the current Rule.\n\n\nConsumer Products \n\n\nApparel \n\n\nFruit of the Loom Inc.

For the North American market, which is FOL\u2019s predominant sales region, cloth manufacturing is primarily performed in Honduras. Labor-intensive cutting, sewing and packaging operations are in Central America, the Caribbean and Vietnam. For the European market, products are either sourced from third-party contractors in Europe or Asia or sewn in Morocco from textiles internally produced in Morocco. Bras, athletic equipment, sporting goods and other athletic apparel lines are generally sourced from third-party contractors located primarily in Asia. \n\n\nU.S.-grown cotton fiber and U.S.-manufactured polyester fiber are the main raw materials used in manufacturing FOL\u2019s products. Historically, fibers have been purchased from a limited number of third parties. In 2015, FOL entered into an agreement with one key supplier to provide the majority of its yarn spinning/raw material conversion services. As a result, yarn production was primarily with one supplier. Supply chain issues related to the COVID pandemic including labor shortage at suppliers, yarn shortages, and price inflation in raw materials and freight resulted in FOL utilizing alternative sources of raw materials and yarn in 2021. Further, FOL has contracted with an additional supplier for a significant portion of FOL\u2019s yarn spinning/raw material conversion services that is scheduled to begin in July 2022. If relationships with suppliers cannot be maintained or delays occur in obtaining alternative sources of supply, production and operating results can be adversely affected.

Until March 2020, other services included the newspaper publishing businesses conducted through The Buffalo News and BH Media Group, Inc. These operations were sold in 2020.\n\n\nRetailing Businesses \n\n\nBerkshire\u2019s retailing businesses include automotive, home furnishings and several other operations that sell various consumer products. Berkshire\u2019s retailing businesses employed approximately 26,000 people at the end of 2021. Information regarding each of these operations follows. \n\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Automotive \n\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (\u201cBHA\u201d) and its affiliates is one of the largest automotive retailers in the United States, currently operating 105 new vehicle franchises through 82 dealerships located primarily in major metropolitan markets in the United States. The dealerships sell new and used vehicles, vehicle maintenance and repair services, extended service contracts, vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products. BHA also arranges financing for its customers through third-party lenders. BHA operates 28 collision centers directly connected to the dealerships\u2019 operations and owns and operates two auto auctions and a fluid maintenance products distribution company. \n\n\nDealership operations are highly concentrated in the Arizona and Texas markets, with approximately 75% of dealership-related revenues derived from sales in these markets. BHA currently maintains franchise agreements with 27 different vehicle manufacturers, although it derives a significant portion of its revenue from the Toyota/Lexus, General Motors, Ford/Lincoln, Nissan/Infiniti and Honda/Acura brands. Approximately 90% of BHA\u2019s annual revenues are from dealerships representing these manufacturers. \n\n\nThe retail automotive industry is highly competitive. BHA faces competition from other large public and private dealership groups, as well as individual franchised dealerships and competition via the Internet. Given the pricing transparency available via the Internet, and the fact that franchised dealers acquire vehicles from the manufacturers on the same terms irrespective of volume, the location and quality of the dealership facility, customer service and transaction speed are key differentiators in attracting customers. \n\n\nBHA\u2019s overall relationships with the automobile manufacturers are governed by framework agreements. The framework agreements contain provisions relating to the management, operation, acquisition and ownership structure of BHA\u2019s dealerships. Failure to meet the terms of these agreements could adversely impact BHA\u2019s ability to acquire additional dealerships representing those manufacturers. Additionally, these agreements contain limitations on the number of dealerships from a specific manufacturer that may be owned by BHA. \n\n\nK-21\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIndividual dealerships operate under franchise agreements with the manufacturer, which grants the dealership entity a non-exclusive right to sell the manufacturer\u2019s brand of vehicles and offer related parts and service within a specified market area, as well as the right to use the manufacturer\u2019s trademarks. The agreements contain various requirements and restrictions related to the management and operation of the franchised dealership and provide for termination of the agreement by the manufacturer or non-renewal for a variety of causes. \nS\ntates generally have automotive dealership franchise laws that provide substantial protection to the franchisee, and it is difficult for a manufacturer to terminate or not renew a franchise agreement outside of bankruptcy or with \u201cgood cause\u201d under the applicable state franchise law. \n\n\nBHA also develops, underwrites and administers various vehicle protection plans as well as life and accident and health insurance plans sold to consumers through BHA\u2019s dealerships and third-party dealerships. BHA also develops proprietary training programs and materials and provides ongoing monitoring and training of the dealership\u2019s finance and insurance personnel. \n\n\nHome furnishings retailing \n\n\nThe home furnishings businesses consist of Nebraska Furniture Mart Inc. (\u201cNFM\u201d), R.C. Willey Home Furnishings (\u201cR.C. Willey\u201d), Star Furniture Company (\u201cStar\u201d) and Jordan\u2019s Furniture, Inc. (\u201cJordan\u2019s\u201d). These businesses offer a wide selection of furniture, bedding and accessories. In addition, NFM and R.C. Willey sell a full line of major household appliances, electronics, computers and other home furnishings and offer customer financing to complement their retail operations. An important feature of each of these businesses is their ability to control costs and to produce high business volume by offering significant value to their customers. \n\n\nNFM operates its business from \nfour retail complexes with almost 4.5 million square feet of retail, warehouse and administrative facilities located in Omaha, Nebraska, Clive, Iowa, Kansas City, Kansas and The Colony, Texas. NFM also owns Homemakers Furniture located in Urbandale, Iowa, which has approximately 600,000 square feet of retail, warehouse and administrative space. \nNFM is the largest furniture retailer in each of these markets. R.C. Willey, based in Salt Lake City, Utah, currently operates eleven full-line retail home furnishings stores and three distribution centers. These facilities include approximately 1.5\u00a0million square feet of retail space with five stores located in Utah, one store in Meridian, Idaho, three stores in Nevada (Las Vegas and Reno) and two stores in the Sacramento, California area. \n\n\nJordan\u2019s operates a retail furniture business from seven locations with approximately 890,000 square feet of retail space in stores located in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Maine and Connecticut. The retail stores are supported by an 800,000 square foot distribution center in Taunton, Massachusetts. Jordan\u2019s is the largest furniture retailer, as measured by sales, in Massachusetts, Maine and New Hampshire. Jordan\u2019s is well known in its markets for its unique store arrangements and advertising campaigns. Star has operated home furnishings retail stores in Texas for many years. Star\u2019s retail facilities currently include about 700,000 square feet of retail space in 10 locations in Texas, including seven in Houston. \n\n\nOther retailing \n\n\nBorsheim Jewelry Company, Inc. (\u201cBorsheims\u201d) operates from a single store in Omaha, Nebraska. Borsheims is a high-volume retailer of fine jewelry, watches, crystal, china, stemware, flatware, gifts and collectibles.

Thirty-eight of its retail locations are concept stores operating under a franchise agreement that sell only Pandora jewelry. One store is a Breitling concept store, selling only Breitling timepieces. \n\n\nSee\u2019s Candy Shops, Incorporated (\u201cSee\u2019s\u201d) produces boxed chocolates and other confectionery products with an emphasis on quality and distinctiveness in two large kitchens in Los Angeles and South San Francisco and a facility in Burlingame, California.

Risk Factors \n\n\nBerkshire and its subsidiaries (referred to herein as \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour\u201d or similar expressions) are subject to certain risks and uncertainties in its business operations which are described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that are presently unknown or are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operations. \n\n\nGeneral Business Risks \n\n\nTerrorist\n acts could hurt our operating businesses. \n\n\nA cyber, biological, nuclear or chemical attack could produce significant losses to our worldwide operations. Our business operations could be adversely affected from such acts through the loss of human resources or destruction of production facilities and information systems. We share the risk with all businesses. \n\n\nCyber security risks \n\n\nWe rely on technology in virtually all aspects of our business. Like those of many large businesses, certain of our information systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access, phishing efforts, denial-of-service attacks and other cyber-attacks and we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future as such attacks become more sophisticated and frequent. A significant disruption or failure of our technology systems could result in service interruptions, safety failures, security events, regulatory compliance failures, an inability to protect information and assets against unauthorized users and other operational difficulties. Attacks perpetrated against our systems could result in loss of assets and critical information and expose us to remediation costs and reputational damage. \n\n\nAlthough we have taken steps intended to mitigate these risks, including business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis, a significant disruption or cyber intrusion at one or more of our significant operations could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Additionally, if we are unable to acquire, develop, implement, adopt or protect rights around new technology, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage, which could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. \n\n\nCyber-attacks could further adversely affect our ability to operate facilities, information technology and business systems or compromise confidential customer and employee information. Political, economic, social or financial market instability or damage to or interference with our operating assets, customers or suppliers from cyber-attacks may result in business interruptions, lost revenues, higher commodity prices, disruption in fuel supplies, lower energy consumption, unstable markets, increased security, repair or other costs, or may materially adversely affect us in ways that cannot be predicted at this time. Any of these risks could materially affect our consolidated financial results. Furthermore, instability in the financial markets resulting from terrorism, sustained or significant cyber-attacks or war could also have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise capital. We share these risks with all businesses. \n\n\nWe are dependent on a few key people for our major investment and capital allocation decisions. \n\n\nMajor investment decisions and all major capital allocation decisions are made by Warren E. Buffett, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, age 91, in consultation with Charles T. Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, age 98. In 2018, Berkshire\u2019s Board of Directors appointed Mr.\u00a0Gregory Abel as Vice Chairman of Berkshire\u2019s non-insurance operations and Mr.\u00a0Ajit Jain as Vice Chairman of Berkshire\u2019s insurance operations. Mr.\u00a0Abel and Mr.\u00a0Jain each report directly to Mr.\u00a0Buffett. Mr.\u00a0Buffett continues to be responsible for major capital allocation and investment decisions.\n\n\nIf for any reason the services of our key personnel, particularly Mr.\u00a0Buffett, were to become unavailable, there could be a material adverse effect on our operations. Should a replacement for Mr. Buffett be needed currently, Berkshire\u2019s Board of Directors has agreed that Mr. Abel should replace Mr. Buffett. The Board continually monitors this risk and could alter its current view regarding a replacement for Mr.\u00a0Buffett in the future. We believe that the Board\u2019s succession plan, together with the outstanding managers running our numerous and highly diversified operating units helps to mitigate this risk. \n\n\nK-24\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\n need \nqualified\n personnel to manage and operate our various businesses. \n\n\nIn our decentralized business model, we need qualified and competent management to direct day-to-day business activities of our operating subsidiaries and to manage changes in future business operations due to changing business or regulatory environments. Our operating subsidiaries also need qualified and competent personnel in executing their business plans and serving their customers, suppliers and other stakeholders. Our inability to recruit and retain qualified and competent managers and personnel could negatively affect the operating results, financial condition and liquidity of our subsidiaries and Berkshire as a whole. \n\n\nInvestments are unusually concentrated in equity securities and fair values are subject to loss in value. \n\n\nWe concentrate a high percentage of the equity security investments of our insurance subsidiaries in a relatively small number of equity securities. A significant decline in the fair values of our larger investments in equity securities may produce a material decline in our consolidated shareholders\u2019 equity and our consolidated earnings. \n\n\nSince a large percentage of our equity securities are held by our insurance subsidiaries, significant decreases in the fair values of these investments will produce significant declines in the statutory surplus of our insurance business. Our large statutory surplus is a competitive advantage, and a long-term material decline could have an adverse effect on our claims-paying ability ratings and our ability to write new insurance business thus potentially reducing our future underwriting profits. \n\n\nCompetition\n and technology may erode our business franchises and result in lower earnings. \n\n\nEach of our operating businesses face intense competition within markets in which they operate. While we manage our businesses with the objective of achieving long-term sustainable growth by developing and strengthening competitive advantages, many factors, including technological changes, may erode or prevent the strengthening of competitive advantages. Accordingly, our future operating results will depend to some degree on our operating units successfully protecting and enhancing their competitive advantages. If our operating businesses are unsuccessful in these efforts, our periodic operating results in the future may decline. \n\n\nUnfavorable general economic conditions may significantly reduce our operating earnings and impair our ability to access capital markets at a reasonable cost. \n\n\nOur operating businesses are subject to normal economic cycles affecting the general economy or the specific industries in which they operate. Significant deteriorations of economic conditions over a prolonged period could produce a material adverse effect on one or more of our significant operations. In addition, our utilities and energy businesses and our railroad business regularly utilize debt as a component of their capital structures and depend on having access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates. To the extent that access to the capital markets is restricted or the cost of funding increases, these operations could be adversely affected. \n\n\nEpidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, including COVID-19, could hurt our operating businesses. \n\n\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has adversely affected, and in the future it or other epidemics, pandemics or outbreaks may adversely affect, our operations, including our equity securities portfolio. This is or may be due to closures or restrictions requested or mandated by governmental authorities, disruption to supply chains and workforce, reduction of demand for our products and services, credit losses when customers and other counterparties fail to satisfy their obligations to us, and volatility in global equity securities markets, among other factors. We share most of these risks with all businesses. \n\n\nRegulatory changes may adversely impact our future operating results. \n\n\nOver time, in response to financial markets crises, global economic recessions, and social and environmental issues, regulatory initiatives were adopted in the United States and elsewhere. Such initiatives addressed for example, the regulation of banks and other major financial institutions, products and environmental and global-warming matters. These initiatives impact all of our businesses, albeit in varying ways. Increased regulatory compliance costs could have a significant negative impact on our operating businesses, as well as on the businesses in which we have a significant, but not controlling economic interests. We cannot predict whether such initiatives will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. \n\n\nData privacy regulations have recently been enacted in various jurisdictions in the U.S. and throughout the world. These regulations address numerous aspects related to the security of personal information that is stored in our information systems, networks and facilities. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in reputational damage and significant penalties.\n\n\nK-25\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks unique to our regulated businesses \n\n\nOur tolerance for risk in our insurance businesses may result in significant underwriting losses. \n\n\nWhen properly paid for the risk assumed, we have been and will continue to be willing to assume more risk from a single event than any other insurer has knowingly assumed. Accordingly, we could incur a significant loss from a single catastrophe event resulting from a natural disaster or man-made catastrophes such as terrorism or cyber-attacks. We employ various disciplined underwriting practices intended to mitigate potential losses and attempt to take into account all possible correlations and avoid writing groups of policies from which pre-tax losses from a single catastrophe event might aggregate above $10\u00a0billion. However, despite our efforts, it is possible that losses could manifest in ways that we do not anticipate and that our risk mitigation strategies are not designed to address. Additionally, various provisions of our policies, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage, negotiated to limit our risks, may not be enforceable in the manner we intend. Our tolerance for significant insurance losses may result in lower reported earnings in a future period. \n\n\nThe degree of estimation error inherent in the process of estimating property and casualty insurance loss reserves may result in significant underwriting losses. \n\n\nThe principal cost associated with the property and casualty insurance business is claims. In writing property and casualty insurance policies, we receive premiums today and promise to pay covered losses in the future. However, it will take decades before all claims that have occurred as of any given balance sheet date will be reported and settled. Although we believe that liabilities for unpaid losses are adequate, we will not know whether these liabilities or the premiums charged for the coverages provided were sufficient until well after the balance sheet date. Estimating insurance claim costs is inherently imprecise. Our estimated unpaid losses arising under contracts covering property and casualty insurance risks are large ($125 billion at December\u00a031, 2021), and a small percentage increase to those liabilities can result in materially lower reported earnings. \n\n\nClimate change may impact our businesses.\n\n\nClimate change could cause increases in hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and other risks that could produce losses affecting our businesses. Also, failure to comply with new or existing regulations or reinterpretations of existing regulations relating to climate change could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results.\n\n\nChanges in regulations and regulatory actions can adversely affect our operating results and our ability to allocate capital. \n\n\nOur insurance businesses are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such regulations may relate to among other things, the types of business that can be written, the rates that can be charged for coverage, the level of capital that must be maintained, and restrictions on the types and size of investments that can be made. Regulations may also restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments to Berkshire by these businesses. U.S. state insurance regulators and international insurance regulators are also actively developing various regulatory mechanisms to address the regulation of large internationally active insurance groups, including regulations concerning group capital, liquidity, governance and risk management. Accordingly, changes in regulations related to these or other matters or regulatory actions imposing restrictions on our insurance businesses may adversely impact our results of operations and restrict our ability to allocate capital. \n\n\nOur railroad business conducted through BNSF is also subject to a significant number of laws and regulations with respect to rates and practices, taxes, railroad operations and a variety of health, safety, labor, environmental and other matters. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on BNSF\u2019s business. Governments may change the legislative and/or regulatory framework within which BNSF operates, without providing any recourse for any adverse effects that the change may have on the business. Complying with legislative and regulatory changes may pose significant operating and implementation risks and require significant capital expenditures. \n\n\nBNSF derives significant amounts of revenue from the transportation of energy-related commodities, particularly coal. To the extent that changes in government policies limit or restrict the usage of coal as a source of fuel in generating electricity or alternate fuels, such as natural gas, or displace coal on a competitive basis, revenues and earnings could be adversely affected. As a common carrier, BNSF is also required to transport toxic inhalation hazard chemicals and other hazardous materials. A release of hazardous materials could expose BNSF to significant claims, losses, penalties and environmental remediation obligations. Changes in the regulation of the rail industry could negatively impact BNSF\u2019s ability to determine prices for rail services and to make capital improvements to its rail network, resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. \n\n\nK-26\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur utilities and energy businesses operated under BHE are highly regulated by numerous federal, state, local and foreign governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. These laws and regulations are complex, \ndynamic\n and subject to new interpretations or change. Regulations affect almost every aspect of our utilities and energy businesses. Regulations broadly apply and may limit management\u2019s ability to independently make and implement decisions regarding \nnumerous matters including: acquiring businesses; constructing, acquiring\n,\n disposing \nor retiring \nof operating assets; operating and maintaining generating facilities and transmission and distribution system assets; complying with pipeline safety and integrity and environmental requirements; setting rates charged to customers; establishing capital structures and issuing debt; \nmanaging \nand reporting \ntransactions\n \nbetween our domestic utilities and our other subsidiaries and affiliates; and paying dividends or similar distributions. Failure to comply with or reinterpretations of existing regulations and new legislation or regulations, such as those relating to air and water quality, renewable portfolio standards, emissions performance standards, climate change, coal combustion byproduct disposal, hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected species and other environmental matters, or changes in the nature of the regulatory process may have a significant adverse impact on our financial results. \n\n\nOur railroad business requires significant ongoing capital investment to improve and maintain its railroad network so that transportation services can be safely and reliably provided to customers on a timely basis. Our utilities and energy businesses also require significant amounts of capital to construct, operate and maintain generation, transmission and distribution systems to meet their customers\u2019 needs and reliability criteria. Additionally, system assets may need to be operational for long periods of time in order to justify the financial investment. The operational or financial failure of capital projects may not be recoverable through rates that are charged to customers. Further, a significant portion of costs of capital improvements may be funded through debt issued by BNSF and BHE and their subsidiaries. Disruptions in debt capital markets that restrict access to funding when needed could adversely affect the results of operations, liquidity and/or capital resources of these businesses. \n\n", "item7": ">Item\u00a07.

We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 25 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion. \n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected most of our businesses beginning in March of 2020, with the effects to date ranging from relatively minor to severe. Earnings of most of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses declined considerably, and in certain instances severely, in the second quarter of 2020. Over the second half of 2020 and continuing in 2021, many of these businesses experienced significant recoveries in revenues and earnings, in some instances exceeding pre-pandemic levels. However, many of our businesses were negatively affected by ongoing global supply chain disruptions, including those attributable to major winter storms and a hurricane in North America, which contributed to higher input costs. We cannot reliably predict future economic effects of the pandemic or when business activities at our operations will completely normalize. Nor can we predict how these events will alter the future consumption patterns of consumers and businesses we serve.\n\n\nOur insurance businesses generated after-tax earnings from underwriting of $728 million in 2021, $657 million in 2020 and $325 million in 2019. In each year, we generated underwriting earnings from primary insurance and underwriting losses from reinsurance. Insurance underwriting results included after-tax losses from significant catastrophe events of approximately $2.3 billion in 2021, $750 million in 2020 and $800 million in 2019. Underwriting results in 2021 were favorably impacted by reductions in incurred losses for prior accident years under property and casualty contracts. Underwriting results in 2021 were negatively impacted by reductions in earned premium from the GEICO Giveback program, higher private passenger auto claims frequencies and severities estimates and higher losses in the life reinsurance business. Underwriting results in 2020 included the effects of the pandemic, arising from premium reductions from the GEICO Giveback program, reduced claims frequencies for private passenger automobile insurance and increased loss estimates for certain commercial insurance and property and casualty reinsurance business.\n\n\nAfter-tax earnings from insurance investment income in 2021 decreased 4.6% compared to 2020 and declined 8.9% in 2020 versus 2019. Earnings in 2021 and 2020 were negatively affected by declines in interest rates on our substantial holdings of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills. \n\n\nK-32\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n\u00a0(Continued) \n\n\nResults of Operations\n\u00a0(Continued)\n \n\n\nAfter-tax earnings of our railroad business in 2021 rose 16.1% compared to 2020 and decreased 5.8% in 2020 compared to 2019. The earnings increase in 2021 reflected overall higher freight volumes, higher average revenue per car/unit and improved productivity, partly offset by higher average fuel prices and volume related costs. Earnings in 2020 reflected lower railroad operating revenues from lower shipping volumes, attributable to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, partly offset by lower operating costs and the effects of productivity improvements. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business in 2021 increased 13.1% versus 2020 and increased 8.8% in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in 2021 included higher earnings from the utilities and natural gas pipelines businesses, including the effects of a business acquisition, and from the real estate brokerage business, while the earnings increase in 2020 reflected increased tax benefits from renewable energy and increased earnings from the real estate brokerage business. \n\n\nEarnings in 2021 from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased 34.0% versus 2020 and declined 11.4% in 2020 versus 2019. Many of our businesses generated significantly higher earnings in 2021 compared to 2020. While customer demand for products was relatively high during the year, several of our businesses experienced higher materials, freight and other input costs attributable to ongoing disruptions in global supply chains. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have varied among our businesses relative to significance and duration. \n\n\nOther earnings included after-tax goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $259 million in 2021, $11.0 billion in 2020 and $435 million in 2019. Such amounts included our share of impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. Approximately $9.8 billion of the charges in 2020 were attributable to impairments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded in connection with Berkshire\u2019s acquisition of Precision Castparts in 2016. Other earnings in 2021 also included after-tax foreign exchange rate gains of $955 million and after-tax losses of $764 million in 2020 related to non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued by Berkshire and its U.S.-based finance subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (\u201cBHFC\u201d). \n\n\nInvestment and derivative gains/losses in each of the three years presented predominantly derived from our investments in equity securities and included significant net unrealized gains from market price changes. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported quarterly or annual results or evaluating the economic performance of our operating businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings.\n\n\nInsurance\u2014Underwriting \n\n\nOur management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities \u2013 underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire\u2019s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains and losses. We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, as non-operating. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the periodic operating results of our insurance businesses. \n\n\nThe timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider incurred losses exceeding $100\u00a0million from a current year catastrophic event to be significant. The significant catastrophe events in 2021 included Hurricane Ida and floods in Europe in the third quarter, as well as Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter.\n\n\nChanges in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $125 billion as of December\u00a031, 2021. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. \n\n\nK-33\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n\u00a0\n(Continued)\n \n\n\nInsurance\u2014Underwriting\u00a0\n(Continued)\n \n\n\nUnderwriting results of certain of our commercial insurance and reinsurance businesses were negatively affected in 2021 and 2020 by estimated losses and costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including incremental provisions for claims and uncollectible premiums and incremental operating costs to maintain customer service levels. The effects of the pandemic on future periods may be affected by judicial rulings and regulatory and legislative actions pertaining to insurance coverage and claims and by its effects on general economic activity, which we cannot reasonably estimate at this time. \n\n\nWe provide primary insurance and reinsurance products covering property and casualty risks, as well as life and health risks.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2020 and continuing through the first quarter of 2021, average claims frequencies were significantly below historical levels from the effects of less driving by policyholders during the COVID-19 pandemic. These effects were partially offset by higher average claims severities and lower premiums earned from the GEICO Giveback program, which provided for a 15% premium credit to all voluntary auto and motorcycle new policies or policies renewing between April 8, 2020 and October 7, 2020. Starting in the second quarter of 2021, average claims frequencies began to increase as driving by policyholders increased. In addition, average property claims severities increased due to increases in used vehicle valuations.\n\n\nK-34\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n\u00a0\n(Continued)\n \n\n\nInsurance\u2014Underwriting\u00a0\n(Continued)\n \n\n\nGEICO\u00a0(Continued) \n\n\n2021 versus 2020\n\n\nPremiums written in 2021 increased $3.5 billion (9.9%) compared to 2020, which included a reduction of approximately $2.9 billion attributable to the GEICO Giveback program. Premiums earned in 2021 increased $2.6 billion (7.4%) compared to 2020. The GEICO Giveback Program reduced earned premiums by approximately $2.5 billion in 2020 with the remainder of the impact included in 2021. Voluntary auto policies-in-force in 2021 were slightly higher compared to 2020. \n\n\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses increased $5.0 billion (19.1%) compared to 2020. GEICO\u2019s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned (the \u201closs ratio\u201d) increased 8.1 percentage points compared to 2020. The increase in the loss ratio reflected an increase in average claims frequencies and severities and higher losses from significant catastrophe events, partially offset by increased reductions of ultimate estimated losses for claims occurring in prior years. \n\n\nClaims frequencies in 2021 were higher for all coverages, including property damage and bodily injury (thirteen to fourteen percent range), personal injury (sixteen to seventeen percent range) and collision (twenty-one to twenty-two percent range). Average claims severities in 2021 were also higher for property damage coverage (two to three percent range), collision coverage (fifteen to sixteen percent range) and bodily injury coverage (eight to ten percent range). Ultimate claim loss estimates for claims occurring in prior years were reduced approximately $1.8 billion in 2021 and $253 million in 2020, which produced corresponding reductions in losses and loss adjustment expenses. Losses incurred attributable to Hurricane Ida in 2021 were $375 million, while losses in 2020 included $81 million attributable to Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S. wildfires. \n\n\nUnderwriting expenses decreased $199\u00a0million (3.5%) compared to 2020, reflecting lower advertising expenses. GEICO\u2019s expense ratio (underwriting expenses to premiums earned) decreased 1.6 percentage points in 2021, reflecting lower nominal expenses and higher premiums earned. \n\n\n2020 versus 2019\n\n\nPremiums written and earned in 2020 decreased $1.1 billion (3.0%) and $479 million (1.3%), respectively, compared to 2019. The GEICO Giveback program reduced premiums written $2.9 billion and premiums earned $2.5 billion in 2020. Voluntary auto policies-in-force increased approximately 820,000 during 2020. \n\n\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses in 2020 decreased $2.9 billion (10.1%) compared to 2019. GEICO\u2019s loss ratio was 74.1%, a decrease of 7.2 percentage points compared to 2019. The decrease in the loss ratio reflected declines in claims frequencies, partly offset by increases in claims severities and the impact of lower premiums earned attributable to the GEICO Giveback program. \n\n\nClaims frequencies in 2020 were lower for property damage, bodily injury and personal injury protection coverages (twenty-eight to thirty percent range) and collision coverage (twenty-three to twenty-four percent range) compared to 2019. Average claims severities in 2020 were higher for property damage and collision coverages (eight to ten percent range) and bodily injury coverage (twelve to thirteen percent range). Losses and loss adjustment expenses included net reductions of $253 million in 2020 for decreases in the ultimate loss estimates for claims occurring in prior years compared to net increases of $42 million in 2019. Losses incurred included $81 million in 2020 from Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S. wildfires. There were no losses from significant catastrophe events in 2019.\n\n\nUnderwriting expenses in 2020 increased $518\u00a0million (10.1%) compared to 2019, reflecting higher employee-related, advertising and technology costs, partly offset by lower premium taxes. GEICO\u2019s expense ratio in 2020 was 16.1%, an increase of 1.6 percentage points compared to 2019.

The increases were across multiple coverages and occurred in several markets. \n\n\nPremiums written increased $369 million (3.7%) in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting increased premiums written from BH Specialty (34%) and MedPro Group (9%), partially offset by a 13% decrease in premiums written by our other primary insurers. The decline in volume by our other primary insurers was primarily due to lower workers\u2019 compensation and commercial automobile volumes and the effect of the divestiture of Applied Underwriters in October 2019. \n\n\nBH Primary\u2019s loss ratios were 70.0% in 2021, 74.1% in 2020 and 69.1% in 2019. Losses and loss adjustment expenses attributable to significant catastrophe events were $402 million in 2021 from Hurricane Ida and Winter Storm Uri and $207 million in 2020 from Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S. wildfires. Losses and loss adjustment expenses were reduced $631 million in 2021, $265 million in 2020 and $499 million in 2019 for net reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years\u2019 loss events. Losses in 2020 also included increased liabilities of $167 million attributable to the pandemic. \n\n\nBH Primary insurers write significant levels of commercial and professional liability and workers\u2019 compensation insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. Accordingly, we could experience significant increases in claims liabilities in the future attributable to higher-than-expected claim settlements, adverse litigation outcomes or judicial rulings and other factors not currently anticipated. \n\n\nUnderwriting expenses increased $485 million (20.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting the increase in business, changes in business mix and the costs associated with new product development. The expense ratio in 2021 was relatively unchanged versus 2020. The expense ratio in 2020 declined 2.0 percentage points compared to 2019 and reflected changes in business mix and the impact of the Applied Underwriters divestiture.\n\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group \n\n\nThe Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (\u201cBHRG\u201d) offers excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (\u201cNICO\u201d), General Reinsurance Corporation and General Reinsurance AG. We also write life and health reinsurance coverages through General Re Life Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (\u201cBHLN\u201d). We periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactive reinsurance contracts written through NICO. In addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts through BHLN. \n\n\nK-36\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n\u00a0\n(Continued)\n \n\n\nInsurance\u2014Underwriting\u00a0\n(Continued)\n \n\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued)\n\n\nGenerally, we strive to generate underwriting profits. However, time-value-of-money concepts are important elements in establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses due to the expected long durations of the claim liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from such businesses, primarily through deferred charge amortization and discount accretion charges. We receive premiums at the inception of these contracts, which are then available for investment.

written increased $854 million (6.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily attributable to net new business, increased participations and improved prices on renewals and favorable currency translation effects. The increase was primarily attributable to property coverages. Premiums written increased $2.9 billion (27.5%) in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to net new business and increased participations on renewals. \n\n\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses were relatively unchanged in 2021 compared to 2020, while the loss ratio decreased 9.1 percentage points. The loss ratio was 71.9% in 2021, 81.0% in 2020 and 73.8% in 2019. Losses incurred arising from significant catastrophe events in 2021 (Hurricane Ida, flooding in Europe and Winter Storm Uri) were $2.1 billion, which were partially offset by reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for losses occurring in prior years of $718 million. Losses incurred in 2020 included $667 million from significant catastrophe events (Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S. wildfires), losses attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic of $964 million and increases in estimated ultimate liabilities for losses occurring in prior years of $162 million. Incurred losses from significant catastrophe events during 2019 were $1.0 billion and derived from Typhoons Faxai and Hagibis and various U.S. and non-U.S. wildfires, which were partially offset by reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for losses occurring in prior years of $295 million. \n\n\nUnderwriting expenses are primarily commissions and brokerage costs. The expense ratio in 2021 decreased 2.3 percentage points compared to 2020, primarily attributable to changes in business mix and foreign currency effects. Underwriting expenses increased $533 million (20.6%) in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting the increase in premiums earned.\n\n\nK-37\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n\u00a0(Continued)\n \n\n\nInsurance\u2014Underwriting\n\u00a0(Continued)\n\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued)\n\n\nLife/health \n\n\nA summary of our life/health reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2019\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAmount\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAmount\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAmount\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPremiums written\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n5,621\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n5,848\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n4,963\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPremiums earned\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n5,648\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n100.0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n5,861\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n100.0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n4,869\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n100.0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLife and health insurance benefits\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n4,933\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n87.3\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n4,883\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n83.3\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3,800\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n78.0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderwriting expenses\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n1,136\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n20.2\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n996\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n17.0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n910\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n18.7\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal benefits and expenses\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n6,069\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n107.5\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n5,879\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n100.3\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n4,710\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n96.7\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-tax underwriting earnings (loss)\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n(421\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n(18\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n159\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLife/health premiums written decreased $227 million (3.9%) in 2021 compared to 2020. Premiums written in 2020 included $710 million from a contract that covered U.S. health risks that incepted in the fourth quarter of 2019 and did not renew in 2021. Otherwise, premiums written in 2021 increased 9.4% versus 2020, primarily due to volume growth in the Asia Pacific region and favorable foreign currency translation effects. Underwriting results in 2021 were negatively affected by significant increases in mortality in the U.S., South Africa, India and Latin America, attributable to the pandemic. \n\n\nLife/health premiums written increased $885 million (17.8%) in 2020 compared to 2019. Approximately $480 million of the increase was attributable to the contract covering U.S. health insurance risks, and the remainder of the increase was primarily from volume growth in Asia and Europe. Underwriting earnings in 2020 were negatively affected by increased life benefits from COVID-19-related claims and from increased liabilities from changes in underlying assumptions in estimating disability benefit liabilities in Australia, which were mostly offset by lower other life claims and reduced losses from U.S. long-term care business that is in run-off. Results in 2019 included a one-time pre-tax underwriting gain of $163\u00a0million attributable to an amendment of a yearly renewable term life contract. \n\n\nRetroactive reinsurance \n\n\nPre-tax underwriting losses in each year derived from the amortization of deferred charges and changes in the estimated timing and amounts of future claim payments. Underwriting results also include foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Underwriting results included pre-tax foreign currency gains of $56 million in 2021 and losses of $139 million in 2020 and $76 million in 2019. \n\n\nPre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency gains/losses were $838 million in 2021, $1.1 billion in 2020 and $1.2 billion in 2019. Estimated ultimate claim liabilities for contracts written in prior years were reduced $974 million in 2021 and $399 million in 2020. After adjustments to the related unamortized deferred charges from changes in the estimated timing and amount of the future claim payments, such reductions produced pre-tax underwriting earnings of $142 million in 2021 and $230\u00a0million in 2020. \n\n\nGross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $38.3 billion at December 31, 2021, a decline of $2.7 billion since December 31, 2020. The decline was primarily attributable to paid claims of approximately $1.9 billion and the reduction in estimated ultimate claim liabilities. Unamortized deferred charges related to retroactive reinsurance contracts were $10.6 billion at December 31, 2021, a decline of $1.8 billion since December 31, 2020, attributable to the effects of the changes in the estimated timing and amount of the future claim payments and periodic amortization. Deferred charge amortization will be included in underwriting earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods. \n\n\nK-38\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n\u00a0(Continued)\n \n\n\nInsurance\u2014Underwriting\n\u00a0(Continued) \n\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued)\n\n\nPeriodic payment annuity \n\n\nPeriodic payment annuity premiums earned increased $92 million (16.3%) in 2021 compared to 2020, which decreased $297 million (34.4%) versus 2019. Periodic payment annuity business is both price and demand sensitive. Our premium volumes in 2021 and 2020 were affected by pandemic-related delays in underlying claim settlements, which reduced the supply of available business. Our volumes written may also change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, as well as the level of competition. \n\n\nPeriodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses deriving from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities. Underwriting results also include gains or losses from the effects of changes in mortality and interest rates and from foreign currency exchange rate changes on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting results included foreign currency gains of $18 million in 2021 and losses of $67 million in 2020 and $40 million in 2019.\n\n\nExcluding foreign currency gains/losses, pre-tax underwriting losses from periodic payment annuity contracts were $526 million in 2021, $550 million in 2020 and $509 million in 2019. Pre-tax losses in 2021 were partially offset by the effects of higher mortality and by higher interest rates applicable to settlements under certain contracts. Discounted annuity liabilities were $15.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and had a weighted average discount rate of approximately 3.9%.\n\n\nVariable annuity \n\n\nVariable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax earnings of $114 million in 2021, losses of $18 million in 2020 and earnings of $167 million in 2019. The results from these contracts are affected by changes in securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which can be volatile, and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. The comparative increase in underwriting earnings in 2021 was primarily attributable to the net effects of interest rate changes and, to a lesser extent, changes in securities markets.\n\n\nInsurance\u2014Investment Income \n\n\nA summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPercentage change\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2019\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2021 vs 2020\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2020 vs 2019\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest and other investment income\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n589\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n1,059\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n2,075\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(44.4\n\n\n\n\n)%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(49.0\n\n\n\n\n)%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDividend income\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n5,060\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n4,890\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n4,525\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3.5\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n8.1\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-tax net investment income\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n5,649\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n5,949\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n6,600\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(5.0\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(9.9\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome taxes and noncontrolling interests\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n842\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n910\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n1,070\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet investment income\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n4,807\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n5,039\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n5,530\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffective income tax rate\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n14.9\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n15.3\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n16.1\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInterest and other investment income declined $470 million (44.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, which in turn, declined $1.0 billion (49.0%) compared to 2019. These declines were primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. Short-term interest rates declined over the second half of 2019 and throughout 2020. Low rates prevailed through 2021, which resulted in significantly lower interest income. Nevertheless, we believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. \n\n\nK-39\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n\u00a0(Continued)\n \n\n\nInsurance\u2014Investment Income\n\u00a0(Continued)\n \n\n\nDividend income included $121 million in 2021 and $26 million in 2020 from investments in preferred stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Such amounts are deducted from earnings of the utilities and energy segment. Dividend income may vary from period to period due to changes in the investment portfolio and the frequency and timing of dividends from certain investees. Dividend income increased $365 million (8.1%) in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to dividends from the investment in $10 billion liquidation value of 8% cumulative preferred stock of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (\u201cOccidental\u201d) on August 8, 2019, partly offset by lower dividends from common stock investments. \n\n\nInvested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital and from net liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts or \u201cfloat.\u201d The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health insurance benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, reduced by insurance premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $147 billion at December 31, 2021, $138 billion at December 31, 2020 and $129 billion at December 31, 2019. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting earnings in each of the past three years, and consequently, the average cost of float for each year was negative. \n\n\nA summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses as of December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020 follows (in millions). \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nDecember 31,\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n90,688\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n67,082\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquity securities\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n334,907\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n269,498\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFixed maturity securities\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n16,386\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n20,317\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n4,296\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n6,220\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n446,277\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n363,117\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFixed maturity investments as of December\u00a031, 2021 were as follows (in millions). \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAmortized\n\n\ncost\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nUnrealized\n\n\ngains/losses\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nCarrying\n\n\nvalue\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Treasury, U.S. government corporations and agencies\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n3,278\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n3,295\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign governments\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n10,997\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(4\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n10,993\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate bonds\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n1,350\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n411\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n1,761\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n292\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n45\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n337\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n15,917\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n469\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n16,386\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nU.S. government obligations are rated AA+ or Aaa by the major rating agencies.

business mix changes and higher fuel surcharge revenue attributable to higher fuel prices. Pre-tax\u00a0earnings were\u00a0$7.9\u00a0billion in 2021, an increase of 15.7% from 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant economic slowdown that adversely affected our volumes in 2020. Revenue changes in 2021 were driven by continued improvements from the 2020 effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the ongoing disruptions in the global supply chain.\n\n\nK-41\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n\u00a0(Continued)\n \n\n\nRailroad \n(Continued) \n\n\nOperating revenues from consumer products increased 13.7% in 2021 to $8.3 billion compared to 2020, reflecting increased volumes of 7.7% and higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase was primarily due to growth in intermodal in both international and domestic shipments driven by increased retail sales, inventory replenishments by retailers and increased e-commerce activity.\n\n\nOperating revenues from industrial products were $5.3 billion in 2021, an increase of 5.0% from 2020. Volumes increased 5.4% while average revenue per car/unit was nearly unchanged from 2020. The volume increase was primarily due to improvement in the U.S. industrial economy, driving higher volumes in the construction and building sectors, partially offset by lower petroleum volumes due to unfavorable market conditions in the energy sector.\n\n\nOperating revenues from agricultural products increased 5.8% to $5.1 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The revenue change reflected a volume increase of 2.9% due to higher domestic grain shipments and higher volumes of ethanol and related commodities, as well as higher revenue per car/unit.\n\n\nOperating revenues from coal increased 21.5% to $3.2 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 attributable to higher volumes of 8.9% in 2021, as well as higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase in 2021 was attributable to increased electricity generation, higher natural gas prices and improved export demand.\n\n\nRailroad operating expenses were $13.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $1.3 billion (10.2%) compared to 2020. The ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues decreased 0.7 percentage points to 60.9% in 2021 versus 2020. The increase in railroad operating expenses reflected higher volumes and higher average fuel prices, partially offset by the favorable impact of productivity improvements.\n\n\nCompensation and benefits expenses increased $154 million (3.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to increased volumes, wage inflation and health and welfare costs, partially offset by productivity improvements. Fuel expenses increased $977 million (54.6%) compared to 2020, primarily due to higher average fuel prices. Purchased service expenses increased $79\u00a0million (4.0%) compared to 2020, primarily due to higher volumes and the effects of insurance recoveries in 2020 related to 2019 flooding, partially offset by improved productivity. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses increased $79\u00a0million (4.7%) compared to 2020, due to higher volume-related costs.\n\n\n2020 versus 2019\n\n\nRailroad operating revenues declined 11.3% in 2020 versus 2019, reflecting a 7.2% decrease in volume and a 4.5% decrease in average revenue per car/unit. The decrease in revenue per car/unit was attributable to lower fuel surcharge revenue driven by lower fuel prices and business mix changes. The overall volume decrease was primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which severely impacted volumes through the first half of 2020 and caused significant economic disruptions that adversely affected the demand for transportation services. Volumes sequentially improved during the second half of 2020 from earlier periods and recovered overall to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year. \n\n\nPre-tax\u00a0earnings were\u00a0$6.8\u00a0billion in 2020, a decrease of 6.3% from 2019, principally due to the negative impacts of the pandemic on volumes. In addition, pre-tax earnings in 2019 included an operating revenue increase related to the favorable outcome of an arbitration hearing and a retirement plan curtailment gain that is included in other expenses, net in the preceding table. These effects were partially offset by significant improvements in 2020 in service, system velocity and cost performance compared to 2019, along with lower costs related to severe winter weather and flooding on parts of the network, which negatively affected expenses and service levels in 2019.\n\n\nOperating revenues from consumer products of $7.3 billion in 2020 declined 7.6% compared to 2019, primarily due to a 6.3% decrease in average revenue per car/unit along with lower volumes. The volume decrease was primarily due to the impact of the pandemic. Lower international and automotive volumes were offset by higher domestic intermodal volumes. Increased retail sales, inventory replenishments by retailers and e-commerce activity produced recovery of intermodal volumes in the second half of 2020. \n\n\nK-42\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n\u00a0(Continued)\n \n\n\nRailroad \n(Continued) \n\n\nOperating revenues from industrial products were $5.0 billion in 2020, a decrease of 17.0% from 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decline in volume and to a lesser extent lower average revenue per car/unit. Volumes decreased primarily due to lower U.S. industrial production driven by the pandemic, including reduced production and demand in the energy sector, which lowered sand and petroleum products volume, and reduced steel demand, which lowered taconite volume.\n\n\nOperating revenues from agricultural products increased 2.9% to $4.8 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was due to higher volumes, partially offset by slightly lower average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase was primarily due to higher grain and meal exports, partially offset by lower ethanol and sweeteners shipments.\n\n\nOperating revenues from coal decreased 28.5% to $2.7 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily due to lower volumes, as well as lower revenues per car/unit. Volumes decreased primarily due to lower natural gas prices, lower electricity demand driven by the pandemic, utility coal plant retirements and mild temperatures.\n\n\nRailroad operating expenses declined 15.3% to $12.4 billion in 2020 as compared to 2019. The ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues declined 2.9 percentage points to 61.6% in 2020 versus 2019. Railroad operating expenses in 2020 reflected lower volume-related costs, productivity improvements, the effects of cost control initiatives and improved weather conditions compared to 2019.\n\n\nCompensation and benefits expenses decreased $728 million (13.8%) in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower employee counts associated with lower volume and improved workforce productivity. Fuel expenses decreased $1.2 billion (39.2%) compared to 2019, primarily due to lower average fuel prices, lower volumes and improved fuel efficiency. Purchased services expense declined $95\u00a0million (4.6%) compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower volume, improved productivity and higher insurance recoveries in 2020 related to network flooding in 2019. Equipment rents, materials and other expense decreased $344\u00a0million (17.0%) compared to 2019, primarily due to lower volume-related costs, the effects of cost controls and lower personal injury and derailment expenses.\n\n\nUtilities and Energy \n\n\nWe currently own a 91.1% ownership interest in Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (\u201cBHE\u201d), which operates a global energy business. BHE\u2019s domestic regulated utility interests include PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy Company (\u201cMEC\u201d) and NV Energy. BHE subsidiaries also operate two regulated electricity distribution businesses referred to as Northern Powergrid in Great Britain. BHE\u2019s natural gas pipelines consist of five domestic regulated interstate natural gas pipeline systems and a 25% interest in a liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility (\u201cLNG interest\u201d), which BHE operates and consolidates for financial reporting purposes. Three of the natural gas pipeline systems and the LNG interest were acquired on November 1, 2020 from Dominion Energy, Inc. (\u201cBHE GT&S\u201d). Other energy businesses include a regulated electricity transmission-only business in Alberta, Canada (\u201cAltaLink, L.P.\u201d) and a diversified portfolio of mostly renewable independent power projects and investments.

After-tax earnings increased $148 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase reflected higher utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales) and increased income tax benefits from the impacts of ratemaking as well as higher production tax credits recognized on new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service. The earnings increase was partially offset by lower allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction and higher operating expenses. Operating expenses in 2021 reflected increased depreciation expense from the impacts of a deprecation study effective January 1, 2021, and incremental costs associated with wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service, offset by lower costs associated with wildfires and a settlement agreement. \n\n\nK-44\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n\u00a0(Continued)\n \n\n\nUtilities and Energy \n(Continued)\n \n\n\nPacifiCorp utility margin was $3.5 billion in 2021, an increase of $145 million compared to 2020. The increase reflected higher retail revenue from increases in customer volumes and higher wholesale and other revenue, partially offset by higher thermal generation and purchased power costs. Retail customer volumes increased 3.1% in 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily due to higher customer usage, an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impacts of weather.\n\n\nMEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. After-tax earnings increased $65 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase reflected higher electric utility margin and increased income tax benefits, partly offset by higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses included incremental costs associated with wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service and higher natural gas distribution costs, partially offset by lower storm restoration costs. The income tax benefit increases were mainly due to higher production tax credits recognized on new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service, partially offset by the impacts of ratemaking. \n\n\nMEC electric utility margin increased $190 million to $2.0 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The electric utility margin increase was attributable to higher operating revenue from increases in retail and wholesale customer volumes, as well as favorable wholesale prices, partially offset by higher thermal generation and purchased power costs. Electric retail customer volumes increased 5.8% in 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily due to increased usage by certain industrial customers and the favorable impacts of weather.\n\n\nNV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. After-tax earnings increased $29 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase reflected lower operating expenses, lower net interest and finance expense and lower income tax expense from the impacts of ratemaking, partially offset by lower electric utility margin. The decreases in operating expenses were mainly due to lower earnings sharing, partially offset by higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service. \n\n\nNV Energy\u2019s electric utility margin decreased $97 million to $1.6 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to revenue reductions from lower base tariff general rates in 2021 and a favorable regulatory decision in 2020, partially offset by a 3.3% increase in electric retail customer volumes. The increase in electric retail customer volumes was primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers, higher customer usage and the favorable impacts of weather. \n\n\nNorthern Powergrid\u2019s after-tax earnings increased $46 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase reflected higher tariff rates and units distributed, lower write-offs of gas exploration costs, lower pension expense and favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements in 2021, partially offset by the impact of increases in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate. Earnings in 2021 included deferred income tax expense of $109 million related to the enactment in June 2021 of an increase in the income tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023. Earnings in 2020 included deferred income tax expense of $35 million related to the enactment in July 2020 of an increase in the income tax rate from 17% to 19%, effective April 1, 2020.\n\n\nNatural gas pipelines\u2019 after-tax earnings increased $246 million in 2021 compared to 2020. Earnings in 2021 included BHE GT&S for the full year compared to two months in 2020. The incremental earnings in 2021 from BHE GT&S were $211 million. In addition, earnings in 2021 reflected the effects of higher margins on natural gas sales and higher transportation revenue at Northern Natural Gas due to increased demand from the February 2021 winter storms, partially offset by lower transportation revenue primarily due to lower volumes for the remainder of the year. \n\n\nOther energy businesses\u2019 after-tax earnings in 2021 decreased $17 million compared to 2020. The decrease was mainly due to a decline in wind tax equity investment earnings of $56 million, which included increased losses from pre-existing tax equity investments of $165 million, largely attributable to the February 2021 winter storms, partially offset by increased income tax benefits from projects reaching commercial operation over the past twelve months. Earnings in 2021 from other energy projects increased due to higher operating revenue from owned renewable energy projects and a transmission investment, as well as favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements in 2021. \n\n\nReal estate brokerage after-tax earnings increased $12 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was due to a comparative increase in closed brokerage transaction volumes in 2021, partially offset by lower funded mortgage volume due to a decrease in refinance activity.\n\n\nCorporate interest and other after-tax earnings increased $15 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to favorable comparative state income tax benefits and higher earnings from non-regulated energy services, offset by higher operating expenses and higher interest expense from corporate debt issued in 2020.\n\n\nK-45\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n\u00a0(Continued)\n \n\n\nUtilities and Energy \n(Continued)\n \n\n\n2020 versus 2019 \n\n\nPacifiCorp after-tax earnings decreased $32 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease reflected higher operating expenses and net interest expense, partially offset by increased production tax credit benefits driven by repowered wind projects placed in-service, higher utility margin and higher other income. The increase in operating expenses was largely due to costs associated with wildfires, a settlement agreement and pension benefits. \n\n\nPacifiCorp utility margin was $3.3 billion in 2020, an increase of $47 million compared to 2019. The increase reflected higher operating revenue from an increase in average retail prices and lower generation and purchased power costs, partially offset by lower operating revenue from a decline in retail customer volumes. The decline in retail customer volumes was due to the impacts of the pandemic, partly offset by an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impacts of weather.\n\n\nMEC after-tax earnings increased $37 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase reflected increased income tax benefits, primarily from production tax credits, driven by repowered and new wind projects placed in-service, and the effects of ratemaking. These effects were partially offset by higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service, higher net interest expense, lower other income and lower electric and natural gas utility margins. \n\n\nMEC electric utility margin decreased $10 million to $1.8 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The electric utility margin decrease was attributable to lower operating revenue from unfavorable wholesale prices and price impacts from changes in retail sales mix. These effects were mostly offset by lower generation and purchased power costs and higher operating revenue from a 1.2% increase in retail customer volumes. The increase in electric retail customer volumes was primarily due to increased usage by certain industrial customers, partially offset by the impacts of the pandemic. Natural gas utility margin decreased $9 million in 2020 compared to 2019, due to the unfavorable impacts of weather.\n\n\nNV Energy after-tax earnings increased $45 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase reflected higher electric utility margin and lower income tax expense from the favorable impacts of ratemaking, partially offset by higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was mainly due to higher earnings sharing accruals for customers at Nevada Power Company and higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service. \n\n\nNV Energy electric utility margin increased $100 million to $1.7 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher operating revenue from a 1.5% increase in electric retail customer volumes, including distribution-only service customers and price impacts from changes in retail sales mix. The increase in electric retail customer volumes was primarily due to the favorable impacts of weather, partially offset by the impacts of the pandemic. \n\n\nNorthern Powergrid after-tax earnings decreased $55 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The earnings decrease reflected write-offs of gas exploration costs and higher income tax expense, in large part from a change in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate, partially offset by lower pension costs and interest expense. \n\n\nNatural gas pipelines after-tax earnings increased $106 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to $73 million of earnings from BHE GT&S, the favorable impact of a rate case settlement at Northern Natural Gas and higher transportation volume and rates, partially offset by higher depreciation, operating expenses and interest expenses.\n\n\nOther energy business after-tax earnings in 2020 increased $89 million compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to increased income tax benefits from renewable wind tax equity investments, largely from projects reaching commercial operation, partially offset by lower operating revenue and higher operating expenses from geothermal and natural gas units. \n\n\nReal estate brokerage after-tax earnings increased $215 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase reflected higher earnings from mortgage and brokerage services. The increase in earnings from mortgage services was attributable to higher refinance activity from the favorable interest rate environment and the earnings increase from brokerage services was due to an increase of 13.1% in closed transaction dollar volume. \n\n\nCorporate interest and other after-tax earnings decreased $113 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decline was primarily due to higher interest expense and lower state income tax benefits. \n\n\nK-46\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and

Discussion and Analysis\n\u00a0(Continued)\n \n\n\nManufacturing, Service and Retailing \n(Continued) \n\n\nIndustrial products \n\n\nThe industrial products group includes metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision Castparts Corp. (\u201cPCC\u201d)), specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (\u201cLubrizol\u201d)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (\u201cIMC\u201d)), and Marmon, which consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and service businesses, internally aggregated into eleven groups, and includes equipment leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container and mobile crane industries. The industrial products group also includes equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International) and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products). \n\n\n2021 versus 2020\n\n\nRevenues of the industrial products group in 2021 increased $2.5 billion (9.8%) from 2020. Pre-tax earnings increased $714 million (19.0%) compared to 2020 and pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues in 2021 was 15.9%, an increase of 1.3 percentage points compared 2020. \n\n\nPCC\u2019s revenues were $6.5 billion in 2021, a decrease of $853 million (11.6%) compared to 2020. Historically, PCC has derived significant revenues and earnings from aerospace products. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to material declines in commercial air travel and original equipment manufacturing (\u201cOEM\u201d) aircraft production in 2021 and 2020. While commercial air travel increased in both the U.S. and international markets in 2021 versus 2020, demand remains well below pre-pandemic levels, especially for international routes. Long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and strong demand for travel, however, the recovery has been uneven between domestic and international markets. Air traffic recovery will continue to be impacted by the pandemic, though likely more on a seasonal or localized basis as the pandemic shifts to an endemic phase. Near term recovery in build rates will lag recovery in air travel due to the significant finished goods inventory following quality issues with the Boeing 737 and Boeing 787 planes and industry supply chain issues.\n\n\nPCC\u2019s pre-tax earnings in 2021 were $1.2 billion, an increase of 78.8% compared to 2020. The increase reflects the actions taken by management to resize, restructure and improve operations and to prepare for more normalized demand for PCC\u2019s products, as well as from a decline in restructuring costs. We do not expect significant increases in PCC\u2019s aerospace revenues or earnings to occur in the near term, primarily due to the relatively low aircraft build rates related to Boeing\u2019s significant inventory levels and the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial air travel.\n\n\nLubrizol\u2019s revenues were $6.5 billion in 2021, an increase of 8.6% compared to 2020. The increase reflects higher average selling prices, driven by significant increases in materials and other manufacturing costs, as well as slightly higher volumes. Sales volumes in the Additives product lines were negatively affected by severe winter storms in February 2021, which caused the temporary shut-down of several U.S. facilities, as well as other temporary production shut-downs in the second half of 2021.\n\n\nLubrizol\u2019s pre-tax earnings in 2021 decreased 50.8% compared to 2020. Earnings in 2021 included significant losses related to a fire in June 2021 at a facility of Chemtool Incorporated, a Lubrizol subsidiary, located in Rockton, Illinois and impairment charges in the second half of 2021 related to an underperforming business in the Advanced Materials product lines. These losses and charges aggregated $257 million in 2021. Earnings in 2021 were also negatively impacted by the effects of accelerating raw material costs and the previously mentioned temporary shut-down of Additives production facilities, which resulted in lost sales and incremental manufacturing costs.\n\n\nMarmon\u2019s revenues were $9.8 billion in 2021, an increase of $2.1 billion (27.9%) compared to 2020. Revenues in 2021 from the Electrical, Metal Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups increased 54% over 2020, accounting for over half of the aggregate increase in Marmon\u2019s revenues. These increases were attributable to higher volumes and prices, including the impact of significantly higher average copper and metal prices. Revenues of most of Marmon\u2019s other groups, particularly those serving the construction, automotive, heavy-duty truck and restaurant markets, also increased in 2021, reflecting higher volumes and favorable foreign currency translation effects. These increases were partially offset by the impact of divestitures and business closures in the Water Technologies and Retail Solutions groups and lower lease revenues in the Rail & Leasing group, reflecting fewer railcars on lease and changes in lease mix. \n\n\nMarmon\u2019s pre-tax earnings in 2021 increased 40.3% compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to earnings increases in the Electrical, Metal Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups due to higher volumes and average margins. Earnings of several other business groups also increased attributable to higher sales volumes, sales mix changes and lower restructuring charges, which were partially offset by lower earnings from the Rail & Leasing and Water Technologies groups. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nK-48\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n\u00a0(Continued)\n \n\n\nManufacturing, Service and Retailing \n(Continued) \n\n\nIndustrial products (Continued)\n\n\nIMC\u2019s revenues increased 19.5% in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting improving business conditions in most geographic regions and favorable foreign currency translation effects. IMC\u2019s pre-tax earnings increased 47.7% in 2021 versus 2020, primarily attributable to higher customer demand, improved manufacturing efficiencies, operating cost management saving initiatives and favorable foreign currency translation effects.\n\n\n2020 versus 2019\n\n\nRevenues of the industrial products group in 2020 declined $4.9 billion (16.1%) from 2019, while pre-tax earnings declined $1.9 billion (33.4%). Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group was 14.6% in 2020 compared to 18.4% in 2019. \n\n\nPCC\u2019s revenues were $7.3 billion in 2020, a decrease of $3.0 billion (28.9%) compared to 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to material declines in commercial air travel and aircraft production. Airlines responded to the pandemic by delaying delivery of aircraft orders or, in some cases, cancelling aircraft orders, resulting in significant reductions in build rates by aircraft manufacturers and significant inventory reduction initiatives by PCC\u2019s customers. Further, Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX aircraft production issues contributed to the declines in aerospace product sales across the industry in 2020. These factors resulted in significant declines in demand for PCC\u2019s aerospace products in 2020. PCC\u2019s sales of products for power markets increased 2.2% in 2020, primarily driven by increases in industrial gas turbine products, offset by reductions in oil and gas products. \n\n\nPCC\u2019s pre-tax earnings were $650 million in 2020, a decrease of 64.5% compared to 2019, which reflected the decline in aerospace product sales as well as increased manufacturing inefficiencies attributable to lower volumes. In response to the effects of the pandemic, PCC took aggressive restructuring actions to resize operations in response to reduced expected volumes in aerospace markets. PCC\u2019s worldwide workforce was reduced by about 40% from the end of 2019. PCC recorded restructuring, inventory and fixed asset charges of approximately $295 million in 2020. Earnings as a percentage of revenues were negatively impacted in 2020 due to inefficiencies associated with aligning operations to reduced aircraft build rates.\n\n\nLubrizol\u2019s revenues were $5.95 billion in 2020, a decrease of 8.0% compared to 2019. The decline was primarily attributable to lower volumes from economic effects of the pandemic and a fire at an Additives manufacturing, blending and storage facility in Rouen, France at the end of the third quarter of 2019, which resulted in the temporary suspension of operations. Revenues in 2020 also reflected lower selling prices, partly offset by favorable changes in sales mix. Lubrizol\u2019s consolidated volume for the year declined 9% in 2020 compared to 2019 due to declines in the Additives and Engineered Materials product lines, partly offset by higher volumes in Life Science products. \n\n\nLubrizol\u2019s pre-tax earnings in 2020 were approximately $1.0 billion, essentially unchanged compared to 2019. The effects of lower sales volumes, including the effects from the Rouen fire, and lower average selling prices were offset by lower average raw material costs, lower operating expenses and insurance recoveries in 2020 associated with the Rouen fire. \n\n\nMarmon\u2019s revenues were $7.6 billion in 2020, a decrease of $681 million (8.2%) compared to 2019. Excluding the effects of business acquisitions, revenues decreased in essentially all groups, primarily attributable to lower demand from the effects of the pandemic. The largest effects were experienced in the Transportation Products and Foodservice Technologies groups. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower metal prices in the Metal Services group and the effect of business divestitures in 2019. Declines in oil prices in 2020 also adversely affected demand and revenues in the Rail & Leasing and Crane Services groups. Marmon acquired the Colson Medical companies on October 31, 2019, which represents Marmon\u2019s Medical group.\n\n\nMarmon\u2019s pre-tax earnings in 2020 decreased $312 million (24.3%) compared to 2019. The decrease reflected the declines in revenues and increased restructuring charges. Restructuring initiatives were initiated in response to the lower product demand, particularly in the sectors most impacted by the pandemic. \n\n\nK-49\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n\u00a0(Continued)\n \n\n\nManufacturing, Service and Retailing \n(Continued) \n\n\nIndustrial products (Continued)\n\n\nIMC\u2019s revenues declined 13.2% in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting negative economic effects from the pandemic on demand for cutting tools in most geographic regions, partly offset by the effects of business acquisitions. IMC\u2019s pre-tax earnings declined 26.6% in 2020 versus 2019, attributable to declines in sales and margins due to lower volumes and to changes in sales mix. \n\n\nBuilding products \n\n\nThe building products group includes manufactured and site-built home construction and related lending and financial services (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek).\n\n\n2021 versus 2020\n\n\nRevenues of the building products group increased $3.7 billion (17.6%) in 2021 and pre-tax earnings increased $532 million (18.6%) compared to 2020. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 13.6% in 2021 and 13.5% in 2020. During 2021, our businesses experienced strong customer demand and higher sales volumes. We also experienced various forms of supply chain disruptions, which affected the general economy, and contributed to considerable raw material and logistics cost inflation and supply constraints.\n\n\nClayton Homes\u2019 revenues were approximately $10.5 billion in 2021, an increase of $1.9 billion (22.2%) over 2020. Revenues from home sales increased $1.8 billion (26.5%) in 2021 to approximately $8.3 billion, reflecting increased revenue per home sold, changes in sales mix and a net increase in new units sold. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 15.8% in 2021, while factory-built manufactured home unit sales increased 1.5%. Site-built home unit sales were constrained by longer construction periods arising from supply chain constraints and labor shortages. Financial services revenues, which include mortgage origination and services, insurance and interest income from lending activities, increased 7.8% in 2021 compared to 2020. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $18.8 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately $1.7 billion compared to December 31, 2020.\n\n\nPre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were approximately $1.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $440 million (35.3%) compared to 2020. Earnings in 2021 reflected higher earnings from home sales, mortgage originations, net interest income and lower provisions for expected credit losses, partially offset by the impact of rising manufacturing and supply chain costs. The provision for expected credit losses in 2020 was unusually high and included provisions for the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The comparative decline in the provision for expected credit losses was due to fewer actual and anticipated loan foreclosures.\n\n\nAggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $14.5 billion in 2021, an increase of 14.4% versus 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher average selling prices driven by significantly higher input and supply chain costs, as well as higher unit volumes for paint and coatings, flooring, insulation, roofing and other engineered products.\n\n\nPre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were approximately $1.7 billion in 2021, an increase of 5.7% over 2020. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues was 11.8% in 2021, a 1.0 percentage point decrease compared to 2020. While customer demand in 2021 was generally strong, reduced availability of materials and other product inputs from supply chain disruptions negatively affected sales and operating results. In addition, higher costs for raw materials and freight and higher restructuring and impairment charges contributed to the reduction in our pre-tax margin rates.\n\n\n2020 versus 2019\n\n\nRevenues of the building products group increased $917 million (4.5%) in 2020 compared to 2019 and pre-tax earnings increased $222 million (8.4%) over 2019. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 13.5% in 2020 and 13.0% in 2019. \n\n\nK-50\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManagement\u2019s\n Discussion and Analysis\u00a0\n(Continued)\n \n\n\nManufacturing, Service and Retailing \n(Continued) \n\n\nBuilding products (Continued)\n\n\nClayton Homes\u2019 revenues were approximately $8.6 billion in 2020, an increase of $1.3 billion (17.1%) over 2019. The increase was primarily due to increases in home sales of $1.0 billion (18.4%), driven by increases in units sold and revenue per home sold and by changes in sales mix. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 28.6% in 2020 over 2019, while revenue per home increased slightly. Manufactured home unit sales increased 2.8% in 2020. Financial services revenues increased 13.7% in 2020 compared to 2019, attributable to increased loan originations and average outstanding loan balances. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $17.1\u00a0billion at December 31, 2020 compared to $15.9\u00a0billion as of December 31, 2019. \n\n\nPre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were approximately $1.25 billion in 2020, an increase of $152 million (13.9%) compared to 2019. The earnings increase reflected higher earnings from home sales, partly offset by higher materials costs, which lowered manufactured housing gross margin rates. Earnings in 2020 also benefitted from increased interest income, lower interest expense and higher earnings from mortgage services, partly offset by increased provisions for credit and insurance losses. \n\n\nAggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $12.6 billion in 2020, a decrease of 2.6% versus 2019. The revenue decrease reflected lower flooring volumes, in part attributable to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by increased paint and coatings volumes, including volumes from a new agreement with Ace Hardware Stores, and increased volumes in residential markets. \n\n\nPre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were approximately $1.6 billion in 2020, an increase of 4.6% over 2019. The earnings increase reflected the effects of lower average input costs, operating cost containment efforts and lower facilities closure costs.\n\n\nConsumer products \n\n\nThe consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and a manufacturer of high-performance alkaline batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson-Juhl) and jewelry products (Richline).\n\n\n2021 versus 2020\n\n\nConsumer products revenues increased $3.4 billion (28.0%) in 2021 versus 2020. Revenues from Forest River increased 40.2% in 2021 compared to 2020, driven by a 27.6% increase in recreational vehicle unit sales and higher average selling prices, primarily due to significant increases in manufacturing costs. \n\n\nRevenues of several of our other consumer products businesses were significantly higher in 2021 as compared to 2020. The initial impacts of the pandemic in the first half of 2020 from temporary retail store closures and reduced demand had a severe impact on most of these businesses. Apparel and footwear revenues increased 25.3% in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting significant increases in unit sales, partly attributable to inventory restocking by certain customers, and from increased consumer demand. Revenues from Richline increased 39.9%, while revenues from Duracell increased 2.4%.\n\n\nConsumer products pre-tax earnings increased $585 million (41.9%) in 2021 compared to 2020 and as a percentage of revenues in 2021 increased 1.2 percentage points to 12.7%. The increase reflected significant earnings increases at many of our businesses, driven by Forest River, the apparel and footwear businesses, Richline and Larson-Juhl. However, our consumer products businesses, particularly the apparel and footwear businesses, also experienced significant cost increases and supply chain disruptions, causing pre-tax margins in the second half of 2021 to be 1.1 percentage points lower than in the first half of the year.\n\n\n2020 versus 2019\n\n\nConsumer products revenues increased $359 million (3.0%) in 2020 versus 2019, while pre-tax earnings increased $146 million (11.7%). Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues in 2020 increased 0.9 percentage points to 11.5%.\n\n\nK-51\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManagement\u2019s\n Discussion and Analysis\u00a0\n(Continued)\n \n\n\nManufacturing, Service and Retailing \n(Continued) \n\n\nConsumer products (Continued)\n\n\nThe comparative increase in revenues reflected increases from Forest River and Duracell, partially offset by lower apparel and footwear revenues. Forest River revenues increased 11.7% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily attributable to a significant increase in recreational vehicle unit sales over the last half of the year and changes in sales mix. Unit sales in the second half of 2020 increased 31% over the second half of 2019. Revenues from Duracell increased 10.0% in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting the effects of changes in sales mix and increased volume. Apparel and footwear revenues declined 6.1% in 2020 compared to 2019. \n\n\nApparel and footwear sales volumes in the first half of 2020, particularly in the second quarter, reflected the negative effects of the pandemic, which included retail store closures, reduced or cancelled orders and pandemic-related disruptions at certain manufacturing facilities. Sales recovered somewhat in the second half of 2020, attributable to higher consumer demand and inventory restocking by retailers. Brooks Sports revenues were higher, partly attributable to the effect of the reduced sales in 2019 that were caused by shipping delays at a new distribution facility. \n\n\nPre-tax earnings were $1.4 billion in 2020, an increase of $146 million (11.7%) compared to 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to Forest River and Duracell, partially offset by lower earnings from apparel and footwear. The overall increase reflected the effects of sales volumes changes and ongoing expense management efforts. \n\n\nService and retailing \n\n\nA summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service

Customer demand accelerated throughout 2021, as customers attempted to maintain adequate inventories in response to high demand for components in end products and effects of supply chain disruptions. Revenues from aviation services increased 27.5% in 2021 over low 2020 levels, primarily due to higher training hours (24%) and customer flight hours (70%).\n\n\nPre-tax earnings of our service business group increased $1.1 billion (67.0%) to $2.7 billion. Pre-tax earnings of the group as a percentage of revenues were 16.8% in 2021, an increase of 3.8 percentage points compared to 2020. Earnings at nearly all service businesses increased in 2021 compared to 2020, with the largest increases from TTI, the aviation services businesses and the XTRA leasing business. TTI\u2019s earnings increase was primarily attributable to the increases in sales volumes, as well as from improved operating cost leverage and changes in sales mix. The increase in earnings from aviation services was attributable to the favorable effects of higher volume, changes in business mix, increased operating efficiencies, lower impairment charges and the effects of past restructuring efforts, partly offset by higher subcontractor costs attributable to the significant increase in flight demand. \n\n\n2020 versus 2019\n\n\nService group revenues declined $1.15 billion (8.5%) in 2020 compared to 2019 and pre-tax earnings decreased $81 million (4.8%). Pre-tax earnings of the group as a percentage of revenues were 13.0% in 2020, an increase of 0.5 percentage points compared to 2019.\n\n\nThe aggregate revenues of NetJets and FlightSafety in 2020 declined $816 million (13.5%) compared to 2019, reflecting lower demand for air travel and aviation services attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. NetJets experienced a decline in customer flight hours of 27% and FlightSafety\u2019s commercial and corporate simulator training hours declined 30% from 2019. The comparative service group revenue decline also reflected the disposition of the newspaper operations in March of 2020 and lower revenues from CORT, which was driven by lower demand attributable to the pandemic. These declines were partially offset by revenue increases from TTI and WPLG.\n\n\nThe decline in earnings reflected lower earnings from NetJets, TTI and CORT and the divestiture of the newspaper operations, partly offset by higher earnings from XTRA, Business Wire, WPLG and FlightSafety. TTI\u2019s earnings decline reflected lower average gross margin rates, attributable to product mix changes and sales price pressures deriving from ample inventory availability. The decline at NetJets was primarily attributable to increased asset impairment charges and restructuring costs, partly offset by lower general and administrative expenses and a slight net increase in margins. The decline at CORT was driven by lower revenues, partly offset by the effects of cost control initiatives. The increase at FlightSafety was attributable to the effects of contract losses of approximately $165 million recorded in 2019 with respect to an existing government contract and cost control efforts in 2020, which more than offset significantly lower earnings from commercial and corporate training services. \n\n\nRetailing \n\n\nOur largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (\u201cBHA\u201d), representing 62% of our combined retailing revenue in 2021. BHA consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid maintenance products distributor. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan\u2019s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. The home furnishings group represented 21% of the combined retailing revenues in 2021. \n\n\nOther retailing businesses include three jewelry retailing businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See\u2019s Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (\u201cLouis\u201d), a retailer of motorcycle accessories based in Germany. \n\n\nK-53\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n\u00a0(Continued)\n \n\n\nManufacturing, Service and Retailing \n(Continued) \n\n\nRetailing (Continued)\n\n\n2021 versus 2020\n\n\nRetailing group revenues in 2021 increased $3.1 billion (19.8%) compared to 2020. BHA\u2019s revenues increased 19.0% in 2021 compared to 2020, with vehicle sales, service and repair, and finance and service contract revenues each increasing versus 2020. Revenues from vehicle sales in 2021 increased $1.7 billion (20.7%) versus 2020, primarily due to higher average selling prices, as well as a 2.7% increase in units sold. However, new vehicle unit sales in the second half of 2021 declined 18% compared to the second half of 2020, reflecting significant new vehicle supply shortages at OEMs attributable to the global computer chip shortages and other supply chain disruptions. Home furnishings group revenues increased 22.0% in 2021 as compared to 2020, attributable to higher consumer demand and higher average selling prices, driven by higher inventory and freight costs. \n\n\nPre-tax earnings in 2021 of the retailing group increased $781 million (76.0%) from 2020 and the pre-tax margin rate increased 3.0 percentage points to 9.5%. BHA\u2019s pre-tax earnings increased 47.5% in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to increased vehicle sales margins and higher earnings from finance and service contract activities. In addition, earnings in 2021 benefitted from lower floorplan interest expense, attributable to significant declines in inventory levels, and from ongoing operating cost control efforts. \n\n\nHome furnishings group pre-tax earnings increased 67.6% in 2021 versus 2020, reflecting generally higher average gross margin rates and sales mix changes and cost control efforts, partly offset by higher personnel costs. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group increased $321 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The initial effects of the pandemic in 2020 were severe for most of our other retailers due to the restricted operations at many of those businesses. Results in 2021 also benefitted from relatively strong consumer demand and the effects of restructuring efforts in 2020.\n\n\n2020 versus 2019\n\n\nRetailing group revenues in 2020 declined $159 million (1.0%) compared to 2019. The spread of COVID-19 resulted in the temporary closures or restricted operations at several of our retailing businesses and effected consumer spending patterns during 2020. The severity and duration of the effects from the pandemic varied widely at our retail operations. \n\n\nBHA\u2019s revenues decreased 2.9% in 2020 compared to 2019. BHA\u2019s revenues in 2020 reflected decreases in new and pre-owned vehicle sales of 2.6%, as well as lower vehicle service and repair revenues. Home furnishings revenues were essentially unchanged in 2020 compared to 2019. The retailing group experienced lower revenues in the first half of 2020, attributable to restricted store hours, which were substantially offset by increased revenues over the second half of the year. However, supply chain disruptions had a negative effect on obtaining product at certain times, which negatively affected sales levels. \n\n\nThe effects of the pandemic contributed to significantly lower sales in 2020 for our jewelry stores, See\u2019s Candies and Oriental Trading Company, which were more than offset by significant revenue increases from Pampered Chef and Louis. Sales volumes generally increased and operating results improved beginning in the latter part of the second quarter as our operations slowly reopened.\n\n\nRetail group pre-tax earnings increased $154 million (17.6%) in 2020 from 2019. BHA\u2019s pre-tax earnings increased 37.7%, primarily due to lower selling, general and administrative expenses, lower floorplan interest expense and higher average gross sales margin rates. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group increased 1.1% in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting higher earnings from the home furnishings businesses and from Pampered Chef, which were substantially offset by lower earnings from our other retailing operations. \n\n\nHome furnishings group pre-tax earnings increased $79 million (36%) in 2020 versus 2019, reflecting generally higher average gross margin rates, sales mix changes and fewer sales promotions and lower advertising and other operating expenses. Certain of our other operations, including Pampered Chef and Louis experienced significant earnings increases in 2020, while others, including See\u2019s Candies and Oriental Trading Company, experienced significant declines driven by the negative effects of the pandemic. \n\n\nK-54\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n\u00a0(Continued)\n \n\n\nManufacturing, Service and Retailing \n(Continued) \n\n\nRetailing (Continued) \n\n\nMcLane\n\n\nMcLane Company, Inc. (\u201cMcLane\u201d) operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (\u201cgrocery\u201d) and to restaurants (\u201cfoodservice\u201d). McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (\u201cbeverage\u201d). The grocery and foodservice businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, including Walmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales comprised about 63% of McLane\u2019s consolidated sales in 2021 with food service comprising most of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers could have an adverse impact on periodic revenues and earnings. \n\n\n2021 versus 2020\n\n\nRevenues increased $2.6 billion (5.6%) in 2021 compared to 2020. Revenues from the grocery business increased 1.5% compared to 2020, while revenues from the foodservice and beverage businesses increased 13.1% and 17.8%, respectively. The foodservice business was significantly impacted by pandemic-related restaurant closures in 2020.\n\n\nPre-tax earnings decreased $21 million (8.4%) in 2021 as compared to 2020. The decrease reflected significant increases in personnel, contract transportation and fuel costs, which more than offset the favorable impact of higher sales and slightly higher gross sales margins. McLane\u2019s grocery and food service operations were significantly affected in 2021 by upstream supply chain constraints, including the effects of labor and truck driver shortages, which contributed to higher inventory costs reflected in a LIFO inventory reserve increase of $130 million, and disruptions in inventory availability. These upstream supply chain effects, together with the truck driver and warehouse personnel shortages that we are experiencing, adversely affected our customer service levels and reduced our operating efficiencies. In response, our hiring and wage and benefits costs increased significantly in 2021. The increase in fuel expense was primarily attributable to significant increases in petroleum prices. We expect the current difficult operating environment to continue through 2022. \n\n\n2020 versus 2019\n\n\nRevenues declined $3.6 billion (7.2%) in 2020 compared to 2019. The decline was attributable to COVID-19-related restaurant closures (particularly in the casual dining category) in the foodservice business and lower sales in certain product categories within the grocery business. McLane operates on a 52/53-week fiscal year and 2020 included 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in 2019. Otherwise, revenues declined 5.2% in the grocery business and 7.7% in the foodservice business in 2020 as compared to 2019. \n\n\nPre-tax earnings decreased $37 million (12.8%) in 2020 as compared to 2019. The earnings decrease included the effects of increased LIFO inventory reserves of $22 million, credit and inventory losses of $12 million in the foodservice operations and the impact of lower sales. \n\n\nInvestment and Derivative Contract Gains/Losses \n\n\nA summary of investment and derivative contract gains/losses follows (dollars in millions). \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2019\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestment gains/losses\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n77,576\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n40,905\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n71,123\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerivative contract gains/losses\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n966\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(159\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n1,484\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGains/losses before income taxes and noncontrolling interests\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n78,542\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n40,746\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n72,607\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome taxes and noncontrolling interests\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n16,202\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n9,155\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n15,162\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet earnings\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n62,340\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n31,591\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n57,445\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffective income tax rate\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n20.4\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n21.7\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n20.9\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nK-55\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n\u00a0(Continued)\n \n\n\nInvestment and Derivative Contract Gains/Losses \n(Continued)\n\n\nInvestment gains/losses \n\n\nUnrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of our investments in equity securities are included in our reported earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Pre-tax investment gains/losses included net unrealized gains of approximately $76.4 billion in 2021, $55.0 billion in 2020 and $69.6 billion in 2019 attributable to changes in market prices of equity securities we held at the end of each year. In each year, we also recorded pre-tax gains and losses from market value changes during each year on equity securities sold during such year, including gains of $1.0 billion in 2021, losses of $14.0 billion in 2020 and gains of $1.6 billion in 2019. Taxable investment gains on equity securities sold, which is generally the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost basis of the securities sold, were $3.6 billion in 2021, $6.2 billion in 2020 and $3.2 billion in 2019. \n\n\nWe believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our periodic consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance. We continue to believe the investment gains/losses recorded in earnings, including the changes in market prices for equity securities, in any given period has little analytical or predictive value. \n\n\nDerivative contract gains/losses \n\n\nDerivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our equity index put option contract liabilities, which relate to contracts that were originated prior to March 2008. A vast majority of these contracts have since expired. Contracts comprising 63% of the remaining notional value as of December 31, 2021 will expire in the first quarter of 2022. The periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and, historically, were significant, primarily due to the volatility of underlying equity markets. As of December 31, 2021, the intrinsic value of our equity index put option contracts was near zero and our recorded liability at fair value was approximately $99 million. Our ultimate payment obligations, if any, under our contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsic value as defined under the contracts. The pre-tax gains and losses in each of the past three years reflected changes in the equity index values and shorter remaining contract durations. Settlement payments to counterparties over the past three years were insignificant. \n\n\nOther \n\n\nA summary of after-tax other earnings/losses follows (in millions). \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2019\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquity method earnings\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n881\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n665\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n1,023\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcquisition accounting expenses\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(690\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(783\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(788\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoodwill and intangible asset impairments\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(10,381\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(96\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(305\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(334\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(280\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign currency exchange rate gains (losses) on Berkshire\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar senior notes\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n955\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(764\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n58\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Berkshire corporate\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n474\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n279\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n507\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n1,315\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n(11,318\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n424\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAfter-tax equity method earnings include our proportionate share of earnings attributable to our investments in Kraft Heinz, Pilot, Berkadia, Electric Transmission of Texas and Iroquois Gas Transmission Systems.

Our earnings from Kraft Heinz included our after-tax share of goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz in each year. Our after-tax share of such charges was $259 million in 2021, $611 million in 2020 and $339 million in 2019. \n\n\nK-56\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n\u00a0(Continued)\n \n\n\nOther \n(Continued)\n\n\nAfter-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire\u2019s past business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization or impairment of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Goodwill and intangible asset impairments in 2020 included after-tax charges of $9.8 billion attributable to impairments of goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets that were recorded in connection with our acquisition of PCC in 2016. See Other Critical Accounting Policies on page K-62 for additional details.\n\n\nForeign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to Berkshire\u2019s Euro and Japanese Yen denominated debt and BHFC\u2019s Great Britain Pound denominated debt. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produce unrealized gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due to the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Berkshire corporate items consist primarily of Berkshire parent company investment income and corporate expenses, other intercompany interest income where the interest expense is included in earnings of the operating businesses and unallocated income taxes.\n\n\nFinancial Condition \n\n\nOur consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect very significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Consolidated shareholders\u2019 equity at December 31, 2021 was $506.2\u00a0billion, an increase of $63.0\u00a0billion since December\u00a031, 2020. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders was $89.8\u00a0billion and included after-tax gains on our investments of approximately $61.6\u00a0billion. Over each of the last three years, investment gains and losses from changes in the market prices of our investments in equity securities produced exceptional volatility in our periodic earnings. \n\n\nBerkshire\u2019s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class\u00a0A and Class\u00a0B shares at prices below Berkshire\u2019s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire\u2019s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased and does not require any specified repurchase amount. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire\u2019s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $30\u00a0billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. Berkshire paid $27.1 billion in 2021 to repurchase shares of its Class\u00a0A and B common stock.\n\n\nAt December 31, 2021, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $143.9 billion, which included $119.6\u00a0billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities (excluding our investment in Kraft Heinz) were $367.2\u00a0billion. Our fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2021 included approximately $14.4 billion of investments that mature in 2022 and 2023. \n\n\nOur consolidated borrowings at December 31, 2021 were $114.3 billion, of which over 95% were by the Berkshire parent company, BHFC, BNSF and BHE and its subsidiaries. Expected principal and interest payments related to our consolidated borrowings in each of the next five years are (in billions): $10.2 in 2022; $14.6 in 2023; $9.7 in 2024; $9.9 in 2025; and $8.7 in 2026.\n\n\nBerkshire parent company debt outstanding at December 31, 2021 was $21.4 billion, a decrease of $1.3 billion since December\u00a031, 2020, which was primarily due to the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes on Euro and Japanese Yen denominated debt. In 2021, Berkshire repaid Euro and U.S. Dollar denominated debt aggregating approximately $2.2 billion of maturing senior notes and issued Euro and Yen denominated senior notes aggregating approximately $2.2 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2026 to 2041 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5%. In January 2022, Berkshire repaid $600 million of maturing senior notes and issued \u00a5128.5 billion (approximately $1.1 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5%. \n\n\nBerkshire\u2019s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were approximately $17.9\u00a0billion at December 31, 2021, which included senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, of approximately $13.1 billion. BHFC\u2019s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our railcar leasing business. In 2021, BHFC repaid $750 million of maturing senior notes and issued $750\u00a0million of 2.5% senior notes due in 2051. Berkshire guarantees BHFC\u2019s senior notes for the full and timely payment of principal and interest. \n\n\nK-57\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n\u00a0(Continued)\n \n\n\nFinancial Condition\n \n(Continued)\n\n\nBNSF\u2019s outstanding debt was $23.2\u00a0billion as of December 31, 2021, relatively unchanged from December 31, 2020. During 2021, BNSF repaid $1.54 billion of debt and issued $1.55 billion of debentures with a weighted average interest rate of 3.1% with maturity dates in 2051 and 2052. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $51.8\u00a0billion at December 31, 2021, a decrease of $382 million since December\u00a031, 2020. In 2021, BHE and its subsidiaries issued new term debt of approximately $2.2\u00a0billion with maturity dates ranging from 2028 to 2052 and repaid term debt of approximately $2.5\u00a0billion. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries.\n\n\nIn each of the past three years, our diverse group of businesses generated net operating cash flows of approximately $39 billion. Our consolidated capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease were $13.3 billion in 2021, which included capital expenditures by our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (BNSF and BHE) of $9.5 billion. BNSF and BHE maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. We forecast capital expenditures of these two operations will approximate $11.1 billion in 2022.\n\n\nContractual Obligations \n\n\nWe are party to other contracts associated with ongoing business activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as operating lease liabilities and shared aircraft repurchase liabilities of NetJets. Estimated payments of these liabilities in each of the next five years are (in billions): $1.6 in 2022; $1.5 in 2023; $1.4 in 2024; $1.2 in 2025; and $1.2 in 2026.\n\n\nWe are also obligated to pay claims arising from property and casualty insurance companies. Such liabilities, including amounts from retroactive reinsurance, were approximately $125 billion at December 31, 2021. We currently forecast claim payments in 2022 of approximately $29 billion with respect to claims occurring prior to 2022. Additionally, we estimate net payments of approximately $3 billion in 2022 for life, health and annuity benefits under contracts. However, the timing and amount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from the forecasted payments, as well as from the liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We anticipate that these payments will be funded by operating cash flows.\n\n\nOther obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. As of December 31, 2021, the largest categories of our long-term contractual obligations primarily related to fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and capital expenditure commitments of BHE and BNSF and aircraft purchase commitments of NetJets. We estimate future payments associated with these contracts over the next five years of approximately $19 billion, including $8 billion in 2022. We also have an agreement to acquire an additional 41.4% of Pilot in 2023 and agreements to acquire certain non-controlling interests of consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these commitments.\n\n\nCritical Accounting Policies \n\n\nCertain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments in determining the amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying and possibly significant degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. A discussion of our principal accounting policies that required the application of significant judgments as of December\u00a031, 2021 follows. \n\n\nProperty and casualty insurance unpaid losses \n\n\nWe record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as \u201cgross unpaid losses\u201d or \u201cclaim liabilities\u201d) based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable for loss events occurring on or before the balance sheet date. The timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and ceding companies and the final determination of the loss amount through the loss adjustment and settlement process. We use a variety of techniques in establishing claim liabilities, which may require significant judgments and assumptions. \n\n\nAs of the balance sheet date, recorded claim liabilities include estimates for reported claims and for claims not yet reported. The period between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the \u201cclaim-tail.\u201d Property claims usually have relatively short claim-tails, absent litigation. Casualty claims usually have longer claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims may be more susceptible to litigation and the impact of changing contract interpretations. The legal environment and judicial process further contribute to extending claim-tails. \n\n\nK-58\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n\u00a0(Continued)\n \n\n\nProperty and casualty losses \n(Continued)\n\n\nOur consolidated claim liabilities, including liabilities from retroactive reinsurance contracts, as of December\u00a031, 2021 were approximately $125 billion, of which 80% related to GEICO and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Additional information regarding significant uncertainties inherent in the processes and techniques for estimating unpaid losses of these businesses follows. \n\n\nGEICO \n\n\nGEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance. As of December\u00a031, 2021, GEICO\u2019s gross unpaid losses were $23.9 billion and claim liabilities, net of reinsurance recoverable, were $22.7 billion. GEICO\u2019s claim reserving methodologies produce liability estimates based upon the individual claims. The key assumptions affecting our liability estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (\u201cfrequency\u201d) and average loss per claim (\u201cseverity\u201d). We utilize a combination of several actuarial estimation methods, including Bornhuetter-Ferguson and chain-ladder methodologies. \n\n\nClaim liability estimates for automobile liability coverages (such as bodily injury (\u201cBI\u201d), uninsured motorists, and personal injury protection) are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails, so we establish additional case development estimates. As of December\u00a031, 2021, case development liabilities averaged approximately 34% of the case reserves. We select case development factors through analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case liabilities. \n\n\nIncurred-but-not-reported (\u201cIBNR\u201d) claim liabilities are based on projections of the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage. We use historical claim count data to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by quarterly accident period, from which we deduct reported claims to produce the number of unreported claims. We estimate the average costs per unreported claim and apply such estimates to the unreported claim counts, producing an IBNR liability estimate. We may record additional IBNR estimates when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply. \n\n\nWe test the adequacy of the aggregate claim liabilities using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models and paid and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost. \n\n\nOur claim liability estimates recorded at the end of 2020 were reduced by $1.8 billion during 2021, which produced a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings. The assumptions used to estimate liabilities at December\u00a031, 2021 reflect the most recent frequency and severity estimates. Future development of recorded liabilities will depend on whether actual frequency and severity of claims are more or less than anticipated. \n\n\nWith respect to liabilities for BI claims, we believe it is reasonably possible that average claims severities will change by at least one percentage point from the projected severities used in establishing the recorded liabilities at December\u00a031, 2021. We estimate that a one percentage point increase or decrease in BI severities would produce a $290 million increase or decrease in recorded liabilities, with a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to differ from expectations would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction. \n\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group \n\n\nBHRG\u2019s liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses derive primarily from reinsurance contracts issued through NICO and General Re. A summary of BHRG\u2019s property and casualty unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, other than retroactive reinsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses, as of December\u00a031, 2021 follows (in millions). \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nProperty\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nCasualty\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReported case liabilities\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n6,602\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n9,630\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n16,232\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIBNR liabilities\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n6,780\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n15,227\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n22,007\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n13,382\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n24,857\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n38,239\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReinsurance recoverable\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n181\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n892\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n1,073\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n13,201\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n23,965\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n37,166\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nK-59\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n\u00a0(Continued)\n \n\n\nProperty and casualty losses \n(Continued)\n\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued)\n\n\nGross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses consist primarily of traditional property and casualty coverages written primarily under excess-of-loss and quota-share treaties. Under certain contracts, coverage can apply to multiple lines of business written and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we allocate losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates. \n\n\nIn connection with reinsurance contracts, the nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of loss information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting terms. Reinsurance contract terms, conditions and coverages also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than primary insurance policies. \n\n\nThe nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative (individual risk) or per occurrence excess contracts may be comparable to the information received under a primary insurance contract. However, loss information with respect to aggregate excess-of-loss and quota-share contracts is often in a summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data includes recoverable paid losses, as well as case loss estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide reliable IBNR loss estimates. \n\n\nLoss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower in comparison to primary insurers. In the U.S., such reporting is generally required at quarterly intervals ranging from 30 to 90 days after the end of the quarterly period, while outside of the U.S., reinsurance reporting practices may vary further. In certain countries, clients report annually from 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. To the extent that reinsurers assume and cede underlying risks from other reinsurers, further delays in claims reporting may occur. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer may vary depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms, the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance coverage, and for other reasons. \n\n\nAs reinsurers, the premium and loss data we receive is at least one level removed from the underlying claimant, so there is a risk that the loss data reported is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. We maintain certain internal procedures to determine that the information is complete and in compliance with the contract terms. Generally, our reinsurance contracts permit us to access the ceding company\u2019s records with respect to the subject business, thus providing the ability to audit the reported information. In the normal course of business, disputes occasionally arise concerning whether claims are covered by our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through negotiation with the client. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally provide arbitration or alternative dispute resolution processes. There are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. \n\n\nEstablishing claim liability estimates for reinsurance assumed requires evaluation of loss information received from our clients. We generally rely on the ceding companies\u2019 reported case loss estimates. We independently evaluate certain reported case losses and if appropriate, we use our own case liability estimate. For instance, as of December\u00a031, 2021, our case loss estimates exceeded ceding company estimates by approximately $700 million for certain legacy workers\u2019 compensation claims occurring over 10 years ago. We also periodically conduct detailed reviews of individual client claims, which may cause us to adjust our case estimates. \n\n\nAlthough liabilities for losses are initially determined based on pricing and underwriting analysis, we use a variety of actuarial methodologies that place reliance on the extrapolation of actual historical data, loss development patterns, industry data and other benchmarks, as appropriate. The estimate of the IBNR liabilities also requires judgment by actuaries and management to reflect the impact of additional factors like change in business mix, volume, claim reporting and handling practices, inflation, social and legal environment and the terms and conditions of the contracts. The methodologies generally fall into one of the following categories or are hybrids of one or more of the following categories:\n\n\nK-60\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n\u00a0(Continued)\n \n\n\nProperty and casualty losses \n(Continued)\n\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued)\n\n\nPaid and incurred loss development methods\n \u2013 these methods consider expected case loss emergence and development patterns, together with expected loss ratios by year. Factors affecting our loss development analysis include, but are not limited to, changes in the following: client claims reporting and settlement practices; the frequency of client company claim reviews; policy terms and coverage (such as loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits); loss trends; and legal trends that result in unanticipated losses. Collectively, these factors influence our selections of expected case loss emergence patterns.\n\n\nIncurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods\n \u2013 these methods consider actual paid and incurred losses and expected patterns of paid and incurred losses, taking the initial expected ultimate losses into account to determine an estimate of the expected unpaid or unreported losses.\n\n\nFrequency and severity methods\n \u2013 these methods commonly focus on a review of the number of anticipated claims and the anticipated claims severity and may also rely on development patterns to derive such estimates. However, our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities in such analyses generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss rather than with an analysis of historical development patterns of past losses.\n\n\nAdditional analysis\n \u2013 in some cases we have established reinsurance claim liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis, determined from case loss estimates reported by the ceding company and IBNR liabilities that are primarily a function of an anticipated loss ratio for the contract and the reported case loss estimate. Liabilities are adjusted upward or downward over time to reflect case losses reported versus expected case losses, which we use to form revised judgement on the adequacy of the expected loss ratio and the level of IBNR liabilities required for unreported claims. Anticipated loss ratios are also revised to include estimates of known major catastrophe events. \n\n\nOur claim liability estimation process for short-tail lines, primarily property exposures, utilizes a combination of the paid and incurred loss development methods and the incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. Certain catastrophe, individual risk and aviation excess-of-loss contracts tend to generate low frequency/high severity losses. Our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities under such contracts generally rely more on a per contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses. \n\n\nFor our long-tail lines, primarily casualty exposures, we may rely on different methods depending on the maturity of the business, with estimates for the most recent years being based on priced loss expectations and more mature years reflecting the paid or incurred development pattern indications.\n\n\nIn 2021, certain workers\u2019 compensation claims reported losses were less than expected. As a result, we reduced estimated ultimate losses for prior years\u2019 loss events by $136 million. We estimate that increases of ten percent in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately $1.0 billion in IBNR liabilities, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates. \n\n\nFor other casualty losses, excluding asbestos, environmental, and other latent injury claims, we reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years\u2019 events by approximately $375 million in 2021. For certain significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $950 million, although outcomes of greater than or less than $950 million are possible given the diversification in worldwide business. \n\n\nThe change in estimated ultimate liabilities for asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims, excluding amounts assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts was not significant in 2021. Net liabilities for such claims were approximately $2.1 billion at December\u00a031, 2021. Loss estimations for these exposures are difficult to determine due to the changing legal environment and increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge. \n\n\nK-61\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n\u00a0(Continued)\n \n\n\nProperty and casualty losses \n(Continued)\n\n\nRetroactive reinsurance \n\n\nOur retroactive reinsurance contracts cover loss events occurring before the contract inception dates. Claim liabilities associated with our retroactive reinsurance contracts predominately pertain to casualty or liability exposures. We expect the claim-tails to be very long. As of December 31, 2021, gross unpaid losses were $38.3 billion and deferred charges were $10.6 billion. \n\n\nOur contracts are generally subject to maximum limits of indemnifications and, as such, we currently expect that maximum remaining gross losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed $54 billion. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we also currently believe it unlikely that losses will develop upward to the maximum losses payable or downward by more than 15% of our estimated gross liability. \n\n\nWe establish liability estimates by individual contract, considering exposure and development trends. In establishing our liability estimates, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project expected ultimate losses under various scenarios. We assign judgmental probability factors to these scenarios and an expected outcome is determined. We then monitor subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding company reports and other available information concerning the underlying losses. We re-estimate the expected ultimate losses when significant events or significant deviations from expected results are revealed. \n\n\nCertain of our retroactive reinsurance contracts include asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims. Our estimated liabilities for such claims were approximately $12.3 billion at December\u00a031, 2021. We do not consistently receive reliable detailed data regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies, particularly with respect to multi-line or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. When possible, we conduct a detailed analysis of the underlying loss data to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, we develop estimates by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily consider the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which we expect claims will be adjudicated. Legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on our ultimate liabilities. \n\n\nWe reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years\u2019 retroactive reinsurance contracts by $974 million in 2021, which after the changes in related deferred charges, resulted in pre-tax earnings of $142 million. In 2021, we paid losses and loss adjustment expenses of $1.9 billion with respect to our retroactive reinsurance contracts. \n\n\nIn connection with our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charges, which at contract inception represents the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums received. We amortize deferred charges, which produces charges to pre-tax earnings in future periods based on the expected timing and amount of loss payments. We also adjust deferred charge balances due to changes in the expected timing and ultimate amount of claim payments and the effects of the adjustments are included in pre-tax earnings. Significant changes in such estimates may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charge balances. Based on the contracts in effect as of December\u00a031, 2021, we estimate that amortization expense in 2022 will approximate $950 million. \n\n\nOther Critical Accounting Policies \n\n\nOur Consolidated Balance Sheet at December\u00a031, 2021 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $73.9\u00a0billion and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $18.5 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and on an interim basis if the facts and circumstances lead us to believe that more-likely-not there has been an impairment. \n\n\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment reviews. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may differ materially from the forecasts. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds fair value, the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, then the excess, limited to the carrying amount of goodwill, will be charged to earnings as an impairment loss.\n\n\nK-62\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n\u00a0(Continued)\n \n\n\nOther Critical Accounting Policies \n(Continued)\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. The fair value estimates of reporting units are and will likely be significantly affected by assumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of the pandemic on the reporting unit\u2019s business, as well as other assumptions concerning the long-term economic performance of the reporting unit, which we cannot reliably predict. Consequently, any fair value estimates in such instances can be subject to wide variations. \n\n\nWe primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods in determining fair values. The key assumptions and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment tests. \n\n\nIn connection with the annual goodwill impairment review conducted in the fourth quarter of 2021, the estimated fair values of five reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%. The most significant of these reporting units was Precision Castparts Corp. (\u201cPCC\u201d). The estimated fair value of PCC was approximately $34.5 billion, exceeding our carrying value of approximately $31.1 billion by 10.7%. Our carrying value of PCC included goodwill of approximately $7.5 billion. For the four other reporting units, our aggregate estimated fair value was approximately $2.5 billion, which exceeded our aggregate carrying value of approximately $2.3 billion by 9.2%. Our carrying value of these units included goodwill of approximately $1.2 billion.\n\n\nIn the second quarter of 2020, we quantitively reevaluated goodwill for impairment for certain reporting units, and most significantly for PCC. As a result of our reviews, we recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $10.0 billion and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $638 million, of which approximately $10 billion related to PCC. Prior to the reevaluation, the carrying value of PCC-related goodwill was approximately $17 billion. Additionally, the carrying value of PCC-related indefinite-lived intangible assets was approximately $14 billion. Substantially all of these amounts were recorded in connection with Berkshire\u2019s acquisition of PCC in 2016. The initial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial airlines and aircraft manufacturers were particularly severe. At that time, we considered several factors in our reevaluation, including but not limited to the announcements by airlines concerning potential future demand, employment levels and aircraft orders, announcements by manufacturers of reduced aircraft production, and the actions we were taking or may be taking in the future to restructure operations. Consequently, we deemed it prudent under the prevailing circumstances to increase discount rates and reduce prior long-term forecasts of future cash flows for purposes of reviewing for impairments. \n\n\nMarket Risk Disclosures \n\n\nOur Consolidated Balance Sheets include substantial amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with equity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios remain subject to considerable volatility. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities.\n\n\nEquity Price Risk \n\n\nEquity securities represent a significant portion of our consolidated investment portfolio. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics and able and honest management, and we prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each company. Historically, equity investments have been concentrated in relatively few issuers. At December\u00a031, 2021, approximately 73% of the total fair value of equity securities was concentrated in four companies. \n\n\nWe often hold our equity securities for long periods and short-term price volatility has occurred in the past and will occur in the future. We also strive to maintain significant levels of shareholder capital and ample liquidity to provide a margin of safety against short-term price volatility. \n\n\nK-63\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n\u00a0(Continued)\n \n\n\nEquity Price Risk \n(Continued)\n\n\nWe are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts, although our equity price exposure has declined significantly as a vast majority of the contracts written to date have expired. Our ultimate liability with respect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and expiration date. The fair values of our liabilities arising from these contracts are also affected by changes in other factors. \n\n\nThe following table summarizes our equity securities and equity index put option contract liabilities as of December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020 and the estimated effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market prices as of those dates. The selected 30% hypothetical increase and decrease does not reflect the best or worst case scenario. Indeed, results from declines could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentrations existing in our equity investment portfolio.

Our strategy is to acquire or originate such instruments at prices considered appropriate relative to the perceived credit risk. We also issue debt in the ordinary course of business to fund business operations, business acquisitions and for other general purposes. We attempt to maintain high credit ratings, in order to minimize the cost of our debt. We infrequently utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks and we do not attempt to match maturities of assets and liabilities. \n\n\nThe fair values of our fixed maturity investments, loans and finance receivables, and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risks associated with the valuations of our equity index put option contract liabilities are no longer considered significant due to the short duration of remaining exposures as of December 31, 2021. Increases and decreases in interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of these instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions. \n\n\nK-64\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n\u00a0(Continued)\n \n\n\nInterest Rate Risk \n(Continued)\n\n\nThe following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our significant assets and liabilities that are subject to significant interest rate risk at December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020. We assumed that the interest rate changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument and that there were no significant changes to other factors used to determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect the best or worst case scenarios. Actual results may differ from those reflected in the table.

In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in the framework in \nInternal Control\u2014Integrated Framework\n (2013)\u00a0issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in \nInternal Control\u2014Integrated Framework \n(2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December\u00a031, 2021. \n\n\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December\u00a031, 2021 has been audited by Deloitte\u00a0& Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page K-67. \n\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. \n\n\nFebruary 26, 2022 \n\n\nK-66\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "companyName": "BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC", "cusip": "084670702"}
