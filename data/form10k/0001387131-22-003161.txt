{"item1": ">Item 1. \nBusiness\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Bank of South Carolina (the \u201cBank\u201d)\nwas organized on October 22, 1986 and opened for business as a state-chartered financial institution on February 26, 1987, in Charleston,\nSouth Carolina. The Bank was reorganized into a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, effective April 17, 1995. At the time of\nthe reorganization, each outstanding share of the Bank was exchanged for two shares of Company stock.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMarket Area\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Bank operates as an independent, community\noriented, commercial bank providing a broad range of financial services and products to the Charleston \u2013 North Charleston\nmetro area, which includes Charleston, Berkeley, and Dorchester county. We have five banking house locations: 256 Meeting Street,\nCharleston, SC; 100 North Main Street, Summerville, SC; 1337 Chuck Dawley Boulevard, Mt. Pleasant, SC; 2027 Sam Rittenberg Boulevard,\nCharleston, SC; and 9403 Highway 78, North Charleston, SC. We also have a future banking house location at 1730 Maybank Highway,\nCharleston, SC that is scheduled to open in June 2023.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Charleston \u2013 North Charleston\nmetro area grew 11.79% from 2015 to 2020 according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis based on real gross domestic product.\nPrior to the economic contraction resulting from government-imposed shutdowns imposed at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in\nMarch 2020, real gross domestic product grew 15.27% from 2015 \u2013 2019. Charleston and Berkeley counties are ranked in the\ntop ten economies in South Carolina based on real gross domestic product according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The\nlargest nonfarm employers in our market area are trade, transportation, and utilities; government; and professional and business\nservices. Trade, transportation and utilities has been the main economic driver of the growth in the area over the last five years.\nThis includes manufacturing campuses for Boeing, Volvo Cars, and Mercedes-Benz Vans in the area. Based on Bureau of Labor Statistics,\nin October 2021 the Charleston area unemployment rate was 2.8% compared to 4.6% nationally. The Charleston area continues to rank\nhigher than the other major metropolitan areas of the state of South Carolina in talent, innovative capacity, entrepreneurial and\nbusiness environment, and livability.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nReferences to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d\n\u201cour,\u201d \u201cthe Bank,\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d refer to the parent and its subsidiary, that are consolidated\nfor financial reporting purposes.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company (ticker symbol: BKSC) is publicly\ntraded on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d), and is under the reporting\nauthority of the SEC. All of our electronic filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on\nForm 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, are accessible at no cost on our website, http://\nwww.banksc.com\n, through the \u201cInvestor Relations\u201d\nlink.

We face competition in attracting deposits and originating loans based upon a variety of factors including:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\ninterest rates offered on deposit accounts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\ninterest rates charged on loans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\ncredit and service charges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nthe quality of services rendered\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nthe convenience of banking facilities and other delivery channels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nrelative lending limits in the case of loans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nincrease in non-banking financial institutions providing similar services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\ncontinued consolidation, and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nlegislative, regulatory, economic, and technological changes.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe compete with commercial banks, savings\ninstitutions, finance companies, credit unions and other financial services companies. Many of our larger commercial bank competitors\nhave greater name recognition and offer certain services that we do not. However, we believe that we have developed an effective\ncompetitive advantage in our market area by emphasizing exceptional service and knowledge of local trends and conditions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLending Activities\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe focus our lending activities on small\nand middle market businesses, professionals and individuals in our geographic markets and typically require personal guarantees.\nOur primary lending activities are for commercial, commercial real estate, and consumer purposes, with the largest category being\ncommercial real estate. Most of our lending activity is to borrowers within our market area.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCommercial Loans\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, $45.8 million,\nor 14.94%, of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial loans. We originate various types of secured and unsecured commercial\nloans to customers in our market area in order to provide customers with working capital and funds for other general business purposes.\nThe terms of these loans generally range from less than one year to 10 years. These loans bear either a fixed interest rate or\nan interest rate linked to a variable market index, depending on the individual loan, its purpose, and underwriting of that loan.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCommercial credit decisions are based upon\nour credit assessment of each applicant. We evaluate the applicant\u2019s ability to repay in accordance with the proposed terms\nof the loan and assess the risks involved. In addition to evaluating the applicant\u2019s financial statements, we consider the\nadequacy of the primary and secondary sources of repayment for the loan. Credit agency reports of the applicant\u2019s personal\ncredit history supplement our analysis of the applicant\u2019s creditworthiness. In addition, collateral supporting a secured\ntransaction is analyzed to determine its marketability. Commercial business loans generally have higher interest rates than residential\nloans of a similar duration because they have a higher risk of default with repayment generally depending on the successful operation\nof the borrower\u2019s business and the adequacy of any collateral.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCommercial Real Estate Loans\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, commercial real\nestate construction loans comprised $12.1 million, or 3.93%, of our loan portfolio. We make construction loans for commercial properties\nto businesses. Advances on construction loans are made in accordance with a schedule reflecting the cost of construction. Loans\nare typically underwritten with a maximum loan to value ratio of 80% based on current appraisals with value defined as the purchase\nprice, appraised value, or cost of construction, whichever is lower. Repayment of construction loans on non-residential and income-producing\nproperties is normally attributable to rental income, income from the borrower\u2019s operating entity, or the sale of the property.\nConstruction loans are interest-only during the construction period, which typically does not exceed twelve months, and are often\namortized or paid-off with permanent financing.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBefore making a commitment to fund a construction\nloan, we require an appraisal of the property by a state-certified or state-licensed appraiser. We review and inspect properties\nbefore disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nConstruction financing generally involves\ngreater credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends\nlargely upon the accuracy of the initial estimated value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated\ncost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. Construction loans also expose us to risk that improvements will\nnot be completed on time in accordance with specifications and projected costs.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, $165.7 million,\nor 54.04%, of our loan portfolio consisted of other commercial real estate loans, excluding commercial construction loans. Properties\nsecuring our commercial real estate loans are primarily comprised of business owner-occupied properties, small office buildings\nand office suites, and income-producing real estate.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe base our decision to lend primarily\non the economic viability of the property and the creditworthiness of the borrower. In evaluating a proposed commercial real estate\nloan, we emphasize the ratio of the property\u2019s projected net cash flow to the loan\u2019s debt service requirement computed\nafter a deduction for an appropriate vacancy factor and reasonable expenses. We typically require property casualty insurance,\ntitle insurance, earthquake insurance, wind and hail coverage, and, if appropriate, flood insurance, in order to protect our security\ninterest in the underlying property.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCommercial real estate loans generally\ncarry higher credit risks than our other lending activities, as they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single\nborrowers or a group of related borrowers. In addition, the payment of loans secured by income-producing properties typically depends\non the successful operation of the property, as repayment of the loan generally is largely dependent upon sufficient income from\nthe property to cover operating expenses and debt service. Changes in economic conditions not within the control of the borrower\nor lender could affect the value of the underlying collateral or the future cash flow of the property.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nConsumer Loans\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nConsumer real estate loans were $71.3 million,\nor 23.26%, of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2021. Consumer real estate loans consist of consumer construction loans, home\nequity lines of credit (\u201cHELOCs\u201d), and mortgage originations. We make mortgage and construction loans for owner-occupied\nresidential properties. Advances on construction loans are in accordance with a schedule reflecting the cost of construction, but\nare limited to a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80%. Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require an appraisal\nof the property by a state-certified or state-licensed appraiser. We review and inspect properties before disbursement of funds\nduring the term of the construction loan. Similar to commercial real estate construction financing, consumer construction financing\ngenerally involves greater credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction\nloan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimated value of the property at completion of construction compared to\nthe estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. Construction loans also expose us to risk that improvements\nwill not be completed on time in accordance with plans, specifications, and projected costs.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis category of loans consists of loans\nsecured by first or second mortgages on primary residences and originate as adjustable-rate or fixed-rate loans. Owner-occupied\nproperties located in the Company\u2019s market area serve as the collateral for these loans. The Company currently originates\nresidential mortgage loans for our portfolio with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80% for traditional owner-occupied homes.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe offer home equity loans and lines of\ncredit secured by the borrower\u2019s primary or secondary residence. Our home equity loans and lines of credit currently originate\nwith an adjustable- rate with a floor. We generally underwrite home equity loans and lines of credit with the same criteria that\nwe use to underwrite mortgage loans to be sold. For a borrower\u2019s primary and secondary residences, home equity loans and\nlines of credit are typically underwritten with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80% when combined with the principal balance of\nthe existing mortgage loan. We require a current appraisal or internally prepared real estate evaluations on home equity loans\nand lines of credit. At the time we close a home equity loan or line of credit, we record a mortgage to perfect our security interest\nin the underlying collateral.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOther consumer loans totaled $3.8 million, or 1.23% of the loan\nportfolio, as of December 31, 2021. These loans are originated for various purposes, including the purchase of automobiles, boats,\nand other personal items or needs.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nConsumer loans may entail greater credit\nrisk than mortgage loans to be sold, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or are secured by rapidly depreciable\nassets, such as automobiles. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower\u2019s continuing financial\nstability, and thus are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances. The application of various federal and state\nlaws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may also limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n5\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPaycheck Protection Program\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPaycheck Protection Program\n(\u201cPPP\u201d) loans were $8.0 million, or 2.60% of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2021, compared to $32.4 million, or\n10.11% of the loan portfolio, as of December 31, 2020. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act\n(\u201cCARES Act\u201d) was signed into law, which established the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) and allocated\n$349.0 billion of loans to be issued by financial institutions. On December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses,\nNonprofits, and Venues Act (\u201cEconomic Aid Act\u201d) was enacted, which reauthorized lending under the PPP program through\nMarch 31, 2021, with an additional $325.0 billion. Under the program, the Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) will\nforgive loans, in whole or in part, made by approved lenders to eligible borrowers for payroll and other permitted purposes in\naccordance with the requirements of the program. These loans were originated to assist small businesses affected by the coronavirus.\nThe Bank originated $55.3 million in PPP loans to 480 customers as of December 31, 2021.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThese loans are 100% guaranteed by the\nSBA.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLoan Approval Procedures and Authority\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur lending activities follow written,\nnon-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by the Board of Directors of the Bank. The\nloan approval process is intended to assess the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral that\nwill secure the loan. To assess the borrower\u2019s ability to repay, we review the borrower\u2019s employment, credit history,\nand other information on the historical and projected income and expenses of the borrower.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe objectives of our lending program are to:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n1.\nEstablish a sound asset structure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.\nProvide a sound and profitable loan portfolio to:\n\n\n\n\na)\u00a0Minimize risk to depositors\u2019 funds\n\n\n\n\nb)\u00a0Maximize\nthe shareholders\u2019 return on their investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.\nPromote the stable economic growth and development of the market area served by the Bank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.\nComply with all regulatory agency requirements and applicable law\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe underwriting standards and loan origination\nprocedures include officer lending limits, which are approved by the Board of Directors. The individual secured/unsecured lending\nauthority of the President/Chief Executive Officer of the Bank is set at $1,500,000 and the individual secured/unsecured lending\nauthority of the Senior Lender/Executive Vice President is set at $750,000. The President/Chief Executive Officer of the Bank and\nthe Senior Lender/Executive Vice President may jointly lend up to 10% of the Bank\u2019s unimpaired capital for the previous quarter\nend. In the absence of either of the above, the other may, jointly with the approval of either the Chairman of the Board of Directors\nor a majority of the Loan Committee of the Board of Directors, lend up to 10% of the Bank\u2019s unimpaired capital for the previous\nquarter end. The Board of Directors, with two-thirds vote, may approve the aggregate credit in excess of this limit but may not\nexceed 15% of the Bank\u2019s unimpaired capital. Loan limits apply to the total direct and indirect liability of the borrower.\nAll loans above the loan officer\u2019s authority must have the approval of a loan officer with the authority to approve a loan\nof that amount. Pooling of loan authority is not allowed except as outlined above for the President/Chief Executive Officer, Senior\nLender/Executive Vice President, Chairman of the Board of Directors, and a majority of the Loan Committee or two-thirds of the\nBoard of Directors.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAll new credit which results in aggregate\ndirect, indirect, and related credit, not under an approved line of credit of a threshold set forth in our loan policy, with the\nexceptions of mortgage loans in the process of being sold to investors and loans secured by properly margined negotiable securities\ntraded on an established market or other cash collateral, are reviewed in detail on a monthly basis by the Loan Committee. Certain\nnew credits that meet a higher threshold than required for the Loan Committee are reviewed by the Board of Directors of the Bank\nat its regular monthly meeting.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEmployees\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we employed 81 people,\nwith one individual considered hourly, none of whom are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We provide a variety of benefit\nprograms including an Employee Stock Ownership Plan and Trust; Stock Incentive Plan; and health, life, disability and other insurance.\nWe believe our relationship with our employees is excellent.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSupervision and Regulation\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are subject to extensive state and federal\nbanking laws and regulations that impose specific requirements or restrictions and provide for general regulatory oversight of\nvirtually all aspects of operations. The regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors, customers, and the integrity\nof the U.S. banking system and capital markets. The following information describes some of the more significant laws and regulations\napplicable to us. The description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable laws and regulations. Proposals to\nchange the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently raised in Congress, state legislatures, and with\nthe various bank regulatory agencies. Changes in applicable laws or regulations, or a change in the way such laws or regulations\nare interpreted by regulatory agencies or courts, may have a material impact on our business operations and earnings.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDodd-Frank Act\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) became effective. This law has broadly affected the financial\nservices industry by implementing changes to the financial regulatory landscape aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the\nfinancial services industry. This legislation will continue to significantly change the current bank regulatory structure and affect\nthe lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies, including\nthe Company and the Bank.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau (the \u201cCFPB\u201d) to centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection, including\nimplementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws. The CFPB exercises supervisory review of\nbanks under its jurisdiction. The CFPB focuses its rulemaking in several areas, particularly in the areas of mortgage reform involving\nthe Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the Fair Debt Collection\nPractices Act. There are many provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act mandating regulators to adopt new regulations and conduct studies\nupon which future regulation may be based. Governmental intervention and new regulations could materially and adversely affect\nour business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nVolcker Rule\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSection 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, known\nas the \u201cVolcker Rule,\u201d prohibits any bank, bank holding company, or affiliate (referred to collectively as \u201cbanking\nentities\u201d) from engaging in two types of activities: proprietary trading and the ownership or sponsorship of private equity\nor hedge funds that are referred to as covered funds. Proprietary trading, in general, is trading in securities on a short-term\nbasis for a banking entity\u2019s own account. In December 2013, federal banking agencies, the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission, finalized a regulation to implement the Volcker Rule. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has evaluated our securities\nportfolio and has determined that we do not hold any covered funds.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBank Holding Company Act\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company is a one-bank holding company\nunder the Federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. As a result, the Company is primarily subject to the supervision,\nexamination and reporting requirements of the Board of Governors (the \u201cFederal Reserve Board\u201d) of the Federal Reserve\nBank (the \u201cFederal Reserve\u201d) under the act and its regulations promulgated thereunder.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCapital Requirements\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve Board imposes certain\ncapital requirements on the Company under the Bank Holding Company Act, including a minimum leverage ratio and minimum ratio of\n\u201cqualifying\u201d capital to risk-weighted assets or a community bank leverage ratio for qualifying community banking\norganizations. These requirements are essentially the same as those that apply to the Bank and are described under \u201cRegulatory\nCapital Requirements\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements (see Note 18). The ability of the Company to pay\ndividends to shareholders depends on the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to the Company, which is subject to regulatory\nrestrictions as described below in \u201cDividends.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nStandards for Safety and Soundness\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires\nthe federal banking regulatory agencies to prescribe, by regulation or guidelines, operational and managerial standards for all\ninsured depository institutions relating to (1) internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, (2) loan documentation,\n(3) credit underwriting, (4) interest rate risk exposure, and (5) asset growth. The agencies also must prescribe standards for\nasset quality, earnings, and stock valuation, as well as standards for compensation, fees, and benefits. The federal banking agencies\nhave adopted regulations and \u201cInteragency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness\u201d to implement\nthese required standards. These guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to\nidentify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRegulatory Examination\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAll insured institutions must undergo regular\non-site examinations by their appropriate banking agency. The cost of examinations of insured depository institutions and any affiliates\nmay be assessed by the appropriate banking agency against each institution or affiliate, as it deems necessary or appropriate.\nInsured institutions are required to submit annual reports to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d), their\nfederal regulatory agency, and state supervisor, when applicable. As a state-chartered bank located in South Carolina, the Bank\nis also subject to the regulations of the South Carolina State Board of Financial Institutions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe federal banking regulatory agencies\nprescribe, by regulation, standards for all insured depository institutions and depository institution holding companies relating\nto, among other things, the following:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nInternal controls\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nInformation systems and audit systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nLoan documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nCredit underwriting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nInterest rate risk exposure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nAsset quality\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nLiquidity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nCapital adequacy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nBank Secrecy Act\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\nSensitivity to market risk\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTransactions with Affiliates and Insiders\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are subject to certain restrictions\non extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, certain principal shareholders, and their related interests. Such extensions\nof credit must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates, and collateral, as those prevailing at the time\nfor comparable transactions with third parties and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable\nfeatures.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDividends\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s principal source of\ncash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to its shareholders, is dividends it receives from the Bank. Statutory and regulatory\nlimitations apply to the Bank\u2019s payment of dividends to the Company. As a general rule, the amount of a dividend may not\nexceed, without prior regulatory approval, the sum of net income in the calendar year to date and the retained net earnings of\nthe immediately preceding two calendar years.

This discussion\nshould be reviewed in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes presented in Item 8\nof this report and the supplemental financial data appearing throughout this report. Since the primary asset of the Company is\nits wholly-owned subsidiary, most of the discussion and analysis relates to the Bank.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company is a bank holding company headquartered\nin Charleston, South Carolina, with $679.2 million in assets as of December 31, 2021 and net income of $6.7 million for the year\nended December 31, 2021. The Company offers a broad range of financial services through its wholly owned subsidiary, the Bank.\nThe Bank is a state-chartered commercial bank, which operates principally in the Charleston, Dorchester, and Berkeley counties\nof South Carolina. The Bank\u2019s original and current concept is to be a full service financial institution specializing in\npersonal service, responsiveness, and attention to detail to foster long-standing relationships.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe derive most of our income from interest\non loans and investment securities. The primary source of funding for making these loans and purchasing investment securities is\nour interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposits. Consequently, one of the key measures of our success is the amount of net\ninterest income, or the difference between the income on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the expense\non our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits. Another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest-earning\nassets and the rate we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA consequence of lending activities is\nthat we may incur credit losses. The amount of such losses will vary depending upon the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio\nas affected by economic conditions such as rising interest rates and the financial performance of borrowers. The reserve for credit\nlosses consists of the allowance for loan losses (the \u201callowance\u201d) and a reserve for unfunded commitments (the \u201cunfunded\nreserve\u201d). The allowance provides for probable and estimable losses inherent in our loan portfolio while the unfunded reserve\nprovides for potential losses related to unfunded lending commitments. For a detailed discussion on the allowance for loan losses,\nsee \u201cAllowance for Loan Losses\u201d.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition to earning interest on loans\nand investment securities, we earn income through fees and other expenses we charge to the customer. The various components of\nother income and other expenses are described in the following discussion. The discussion and analysis also identifies significant\nfactors that have affected our financial position and operating results as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared\nto December 31, 2020 and our operating results for 2020 compared to 2019, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated\nfinancial statements and the related notes included in this report.

accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and with general\npractices within the banking industry in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies\nare set forth in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCertain accounting policies involve significant\njudgments and assumptions made by the Company that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities.\nWe consider these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies. The judgment and assumptions we use are based on factors\nthat we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the number of judgments and assumptions that we make, actual\nresults could differ and have a material impact on the carrying values of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe consider our policy regarding the allowance\nfor loan losses to be our most subjective accounting policy due to the significant degree of judgment. We have developed what we\nbelieve to be appropriate policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, recognizing that\nthis process requires a number of assumptions and estimates with respect to our loan portfolio. Our assessments may be impacted\nin future periods by changes in economic conditions, the impact of regulatory examinations and the discovery of information with\nrespect to borrowers, which were not known at the time of the issuance of the consolidated financial statements. For additional\ndiscussion concerning our allowance for loan losses and related matters, see \u201cAllowance for Loan Losses\u201d.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCOVID-19\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization\n(\u201cWHO\u201d) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Due to orders issued by the governor of South Carolina and in an abundance of\ncaution for the health of our customers and employees, in March 2020 the Bank closed lobbies to all 5 offices but remained fully\noperational. The Bank subsequently reopened all of the lobbies in June 2021.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid,\nRelief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) was signed into law, which established the Paycheck Protection Program\n(\u201cPPP\u201d) and allocated $349.0 billion of loans to be issued by financial institutions. Under the program, the Small\nBusiness Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) will forgive loans, in whole or in part, made by approved lenders to eligible borrowers\nfor payroll and other permitted purposes in accordance with the requirements of the program. These loans carry a fixed rate of\n1.00% and a term of two years, if not forgiven, in whole or in part. The loans are 100% guaranteed by the SBA and as long as the\nborrower submits its loan forgiveness application within ten months of completion of the covered period. The borrower is not required\nto make any payments until the forgiveness amount is remitted to the lender by the SBA. The Bank received a processing fee from\nthe SBA ranging from 1% to 5% based on the size of the loan. The fees are deferred and amortized over the life of the loans in\naccordance with ASC 310-20. The Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (\u201cPPP/ HCEA Act\u201d) was signed\ninto law on April 24, 2020. The PPP/HCEA Act authorized additional funding under the CARES Act of $310.0 billion for PPP loans\nto be issued by financial institutions through the SBA. The Bank has provided $55.3 million in funding to 480 customers through\nthe PPP as of December 31, 2021. Because these loans are 100% guaranteed by the SBA and did not undergo the Bank\u2019s typical\nunderwriting process, they are not graded and do not have an associated allowance.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBorrowers must submit a forgiveness application\nwithin ten months of the completion of the covered period. Once the borrower has submitted the application, the Bank has 60 days\nto review, issue a lender decision, and submit the decision and application to the SBA. Once the application is submitted, the\nSBA has 90 days to review and remit the appropriate forgiveness amount to the Bank plus any interest accrued through the date of\npayment. The SBA began accepting PPP Forgiveness Applications on August 10, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, the Bank received 371\nPPP forgiveness applications, in the amount of $49.1 million in principal, and submitted 361 applications and decisions to the\nSBA, in the amount of $47.7 million in principal. Of the 391 PPP submissions, 351 loans, in the amount of $46.9 million, were forgiven\nas of December 31, 2021. Upon forgiveness the Bank will recognize the deferred fee income in accordance with ASC 310-20. The Bank\nreceived processing fees of $2.4 million and recognized $1.3 million and $0.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2021\nand 2020, respectively.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRegulatory agencies, as set forth in the\nInteragency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus\n(initially issued on March 22, 2020 and revised on April 7, 2020), have encouraged financial institutions to work prudently with\nborrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the effects of COVID-19. In this statement,\nthe regulatory agencies expressed their view of loan modification programs as positive actions that may mitigate adverse effects\non borrowers due to COVID-19 and that the agencies will not criticize institutions for working with borrowers in a safe and sound\nmanner. Moreover, the revised statement provides that eligible loan modifications related to COVID-19 may be accounted for under\nsection 4013 of the CARES Act or in accordance with ASC 310-40. Under Section 4013 of the CARES Act, banks may elect not to categorize\nloan modifications as TDRs if the modifications are related to COVID-19, executed on a loan that was not more than 30 days past\ndue as of December 31, 2019, and executed between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of December 31, 2020 or 60 days after the date\nof termination of the National Emergency. All short-term loan modifications made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19\nto borrowers who were current prior to any relief are not considered TDRs. Beginning in March 2020, the Bank provided payment accommodations\nto customers, consisting of 60-day principal deferral to borrowers negatively impacted by COVID-19. During 2020, the Bank processed\napproximately $0.7 million in principal deferments to 84 customers, with an aggregate loan balance of $29.7 million. The principal\ndeferments represented 0.24% of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020. The Bank did not process any principal deferments\nduring the year ended December 31, 2021. The Bank has examined the payment accommodations granted to borrowers in response to COVID-19\nand classified 9 loans, with an aggregate loan balance of $4.0 million, that were granted payment accommodations as TDRs given\nthe continued financial difficulty of the customer, associated industry risk, and multiple deferral requests. All other borrowers\nwere current prior to relief, were not experiencing financial difficulty prior to COVID-19, and the Bank determined they were not\nconsidered TDRs. As of December 31, 2021, 4 of the TDRs were removed from TDR status due to improvement in financial condition\nand sustained performance under the restructured terms, 2 TDRs were paid off through refinancing into new loans at market terms,\nand 1 TDR was paid off. Two loans with a balance of $0.5 million remain in TDR status as of December 31, 2021. Additionally,\nof the 75 customers that received payment accommodations that were not classified as TDRs, 41 customers, with an aggregate loan\nbalance of $9.9 million, have paid their loan in full as of December 31, 2021. The remaining loans are paying as agreed as of December\n31, 2021. There are no loans that received payment accommodation past due greater than 30 days. The Bank will continue to examine\npayment accommodations as requested by our borrowers.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid\nto Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act (\u201cEconomic Aid Act\u201d) was enacted, which reauthorized lending\nunder the PPP program through March 31, 2021, with an additional $325 billion. Under this Act, the SBA will forgive loans, in whole\nor in part, made by approved lenders to eligible borrowers for payroll and other permitted purposes in accordance with the requirements\nof the program. These loans carry a fixed rate of 1.00% and a term of five years, if not forgiven, in whole or in part. The loans\nare 100% guaranteed by the SBA and as long as the borrower submits its loan forgiveness application within ten months of completion\nof the covered period, the borrower is not required to make any payments until the forgiveness amount is remitted to the lender\nby the SBA. The Bank will receive a processing fee based on the size of the loan from the SBA and a tiered structure. For loans\nup to $50,000 in principal, the lender processing fee will be the lesser of 50% of the principal amount or $2,500. For loans between\n$50,000 and $350,000 in principal, the lender processing fee will be 5% of the principal amount. For loans $350,000 and above,\nthe lender processing fee will be 3% of the principal amount. The fees are deferred and amortized over the life of the loans in\naccordance with ASC 310-20. Over the course of the PPP program, the Bank extended 480 loans with a total loan amount of $55.3 million.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhile the effects of COVID-19 have impacted\nall industries to varying degrees, during 2020 the Bank assessed the retail and/or service, food and beverage, and short-term rental\nindustries in our geographic area as having a higher risk due to the possibility of the primary source of repayment not materializing. These industries are dependent\nupon the hospitality industry and were affected by the mandates issued by the Governor of South Carolina to limit occupancy or\nclose for a period of time. Our loans in these industries represented 3.96% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2020 and were\ntemporarily downgraded to our \u201cWatch\u201d category during 2020. In May 2021, due to improving economic conditions, increased\nvaccination rates and a continued reopening of the South Carolina economy, these loans were upgraded to our \u201cSatisfactory\u201d\ncategory.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEffects of COVID-19 may negatively impact\nmanagement assumptions and estimates, such as the allowance for loan losses. However, it is difficult to assess or predict how,\nand to what extent, COVID-19 will affect the Bank in the future.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCOMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER\n31, 2021 TO DECEMBER 31, 2020\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNet income increased $0.2 million or 4.40%\nto $6.7 million, or basic and diluted income per share of $1.22 and $1.19, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021 from\n$6.5 million or basic and diluted income per share of $1.17 and $1.14, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020. This\nincrease was primarily due to higher average earning asset balances coupled with a decline in our cost of funds.\nOur returns on average assets and average equity for the year ended December 31, 2021 were 1.14% and 12.30%, respectively, compared\nto 1.29% and 11.96%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNet interest income increased $0.5 million\nor 2.61% to $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This\nincrease was primarily due to an increase in interest and fees on PPP loans and investment securities. Interest and fees on loans and\ninvestment securities increased $0.4 million or 2.35% to $17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $16.7 million for\nthe year ended December 31, 2020, as the result of higher balances of average earning assets.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAverage earning assets increased $86.6\nmillion or 18.01% to $567.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $480.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThis is primarily related to an increase in the average balance of investment securities and interest-bearing deposits at the Federal\nReserve and, to a lesser extent, loans. The increase in investment securities and interest-bearing balances at the Federal Reserve\nreflect the deployment of excess funds resulting from an $85.8 million increase in average deposits during the year.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe provision to the allowance for loan\nlosses for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $120,000 compared to $240,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease\nwas primarily driven by the composition of our loan portfolio in accordance with our allowance for loan loss methodology. The Board\nof Directors determined that this provision was appropriate based upon the adequacy of our reserve. Charge-offs of $20,990 and\nrecoveries of $92,283, together with the provision to the allowance, resulted in an allowance for loan losses of $4.4 million or\n1.43% of total loans as of December 31, 2021. The allowance for loan losses is 1.47% of total loans net of PPP loans.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOther income increased $0.5 million or\n13.61% to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Other income\nreflects increases in gain on sales of securities of $0.3 million and service charges and fees of $0.2 million. Our mortgage\nbanking income increased $46,700 or 2.06% to $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $2.3 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 due to elevated volume associated with a continuation of the low interest rate environment. Mortgage banking\nincome is highly influenced by mortgage interest rates and the housing market.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOther expense increased $0.6 million or\n5.45% to $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Salaries\nand employee benefits increased approximately $0.2 million, or 3.03%, due to increased benefits, payroll taxes and other employee-related\ncosts. Net occupancy expense increased approximately $0.2 million due to rent escalation provisions in certain of our leases. Other operating expense increased $0.2 million, or 14.45%, due to certain loan-related costs and higher FDIC insurance assessments resulting\nfrom an increase in deposit balances.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the\nCompany\u2019s effective tax rate was 23.50% compared to 23.33% during the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n17\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCOMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER\n31, 2020 TO DECEMBER 31, 2019\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNet income decreased $0.8 million or 11.72%\nto $6.5 million, or basic and diluted income per share of $1.17 and $1.14, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020 from\n$7.3 million or basic and diluted income per share of $1.33 and $1.31, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019. This\ndecrease was primarily due to interest and fee income received on loans tied to changes in variable interest rates as a result\nof the significant decrease in interest rates at the Federal Reserve during the end of the first quarter of 2020, combined with\nbelow market interest rates on PPP loans. Our returns on average assets and average equity for the year ended December 31, 2020\nwere 1.29% and 11.96%, respectively, compared to 1.66% and 14.86%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNet interest income decreased $1.2 million\nor 6.43% to $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease\nwas primarily due to a decrease in interest and fees on loans. Interest and fees on loans decreased $0.9 million or 5.87% to $15.1\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as the result of changes\nin variable interest rates as effected by the significant decrease in interest rates at the Federal Reserve during the end of the\nfirst quarter of 2020 combined with below market interest rates on PPP loans.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAverage earning assets increased $57.9\nmillion or 13.69% to $480.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $422.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThis is primarily related to the increase in the average balance of loans related to the PPP program and interest-bearing deposits\nat the Federal Reserve.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe provision to the allowance for loan\nlosses for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $240,000 compared to $180,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase\nwas primarily driven by the composition of our loan portfolio in accordance with our allowance for loan loss methodology. The Board\nof Directors determined that this provision was appropriate based upon the adequacy of our reserve. Charge-offs of $0.3 million\nand recoveries of $0.2 million, together with the provision to the allowance, resulted in an allowance for loan losses of $4.2\nmillion or 1.30% of total loans as of December 31, 2020. The allowance for loan losses is 1.45% of total loans, net of PPP loans.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOther income increased $1.2 million or\n54.87% to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our mortgage\nbanking income increased $1.3 million or 141.04% to $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $0.9 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2019 due to increased volume associated with lower interest rates. Mortgage banking income is highly influenced\nby mortgage interest rates and the housing market.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOther expense increased $1.1 million or\n9.89% to $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Salaries\nand employee benefits increased approximately $0.6 million due to increased salaries and commissions on robust mortgage activity.\nNet occupancy expense increased approximately $0.6 million due to a full year of occupancy in our North Charleston office, which\nopened in September 2019.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the\nCompany\u2019s effective tax rate was 23.33% compared to 22.91% during the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe manage our assets and liabilities to\nensure there is sufficient liquidity to enable management to fund deposit withdrawals, loan demand, capital expenditures, reserve\nrequirements, operating expenses, and dividends; and to manage daily operations on an ongoing basis. Funds are primarily provided\nby the Bank through customer deposits, principal and interest payments on loans, mortgage loan sales, the sale or maturity of securities,\ntemporary investments and earnings. The Asset Liability/Investment Committee (\u201cALCO\u201d) manages asset and liability procedures\nthough the ultimate responsibility rests with the President/Chief Executive Officer. At December 31, 2021, total assets increased\n27.55% to $679.2 million from $532.5 million as of December 31, 2020 and total deposits increased 31.8% to $609.2 million from\n$462.2 million as of December 31, 2020.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, earning assets,\nwhich are composed of U.S. Treasury, Government Sponsored Enterprises and Municipal Securities in the amount of $212.3 million,\ninterest-bearing deposits at the Federal Reserve in the amount of $129.0 million and total loans, including mortgage loans held\nfor sale, in the amount of $309.4 million, constituted approximately 95.80% of our total assets.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe yield on a majority of our earning\nassets adjusts in tandem with changes in the general level of interest rates. Some of the Company\u2019s liabilities are issued\nwith fixed terms and can be repriced only at maturity.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMARKET RISK\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMarket risk is the risk of loss from adverse\nchanges in market prices and interest rates. Our risk consists primarily of interest rate risk in our lending and investing activities\nas they relate to the funding by deposit and borrowing activities.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur policy is to minimize interest rate\nrisk between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities at various maturities and to attempt to maintain an asset\nsensitive position over a one-year period. By adhering to this policy, we anticipate that our net interest margins will not be\nmaterially affected, unless there is an extraordinary and or precipitous change in interest rates. The average net interest rate\nmargin for 2021 decreased to 3.06% from 3.52% for 2020. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, our net cumulative gap was liability sensitive\nfor periods less than one year and asset sensitive for periods of one year or more. The reason for the shift in sensitivity is\nthe direct result of management\u2019s strategic decision to invest excess funds held at the Federal Reserve into fixed rate investment\nsecurities that match our investment policy objectives. Management is aware of this departure from policy and will continue to\nclosely monitor our sensitivity position going forward.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSince the rates on most of our interest-bearing\nliabilities can vary on a daily basis, we continue to maintain a loan portfolio priced predominately on a variable rate basis.\nHowever, in an effort to protect future earnings in a declining rate environment, we offer certain fixed rates, interest rate floors,\nand terms primarily associated with real estate transactions. We seek stable, long-term deposit relationships to fund our loan\nportfolio. Furthermore, we do not have any brokered deposits or internet deposits.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the average maturity\nof the investment portfolio was 4.76 years with an average yield of 1.02% compared to 4.57 years with an average yield of 1.60%\nat December 31, 2020.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe do not take foreign exchange or commodity\nrisks. In addition, we do not own mortgage-backed securities nor do we have any exposure to the sub-prime market or any other distressed\ndebt instruments.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe following table summarizes our

Investment securities classified as available for sale, which are not pledged, may be sold in response\nto changes in interest rates and liquidity needs. All of the investment securities presently owned are classified as available for\nsale. Net cash provided by operations and deposits from customers have been the primary sources of liquidity. At December 31, 2021,\nwe had unused short-term lines of credit totaling approximately $41 million (which can be withdrawn at the lender\u2019s option).\nAdditional sources of funds available to us for liquidity include increasing deposits by raising interest rates paid and selling\nmortgage loans held for sale. We also established a Borrower-In-Custody arrangement with the Federal Reserve. This arrangement\npermits us to retain possession of assets pledged as collateral to secure advances from the Federal Reserve Discount Window. At\nDecember 31, 2021, we could borrow up to $72.1 million. There have been no borrowings under this arrangement.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur core deposits consist of non-interest\nbearing demand accounts, NOW accounts, money market accounts, time deposits and savings accounts. We closely monitor our reliance\non certificates of deposit greater than $250,000 and other large deposits. We maintain a Contingency Funding Plan (\u201cCFP\u201d)\nthat identifies liquidity needs and weighs alternate courses of action designed to address these needs in emergency situations.\nWe perform a quarterly cash flow analysis and stress test the CFP to evaluate the expected funding needs and funding capacity during\na liquidity stress event. We believe our liquidity sources are adequate to meet our operating needs and do not know of any trends,\nevents or uncertainties that may result in a significant adverse effect on our liquidity position. At December\u00a031,\u00a02021\nand 2020, our liquidity ratio was 56.43\n% \nand 38.63%, respectively.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAverage earning assets increased by $86.6\nmillion from 2020 to 2021. This increase is primarily related to an increase in the average balance of investment securities and\ninterest-bearing deposits at the Federal Reserve and, to a lesser extent, loans. The increase in investment securities and interest-bearing\nbalances at the Federal Reserve reflect the deployment of excess funds resulting from an $85.8 million increase in average deposits\nduring the year.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe following table shows the composition\nof average assets over the past five fiscal years.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n2021\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n2020\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n2019\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n2018\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n2017\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nLoans\n1\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n324,078,445\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n313,303,363\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n277,395,432\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n277,223,600\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n260,987,352\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nInvestment securities available for sale\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n167,250,568\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n112,970,054\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n106,421,507\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n123,347,669\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n130,161,937\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nInterest-bearing deposits at the Federal Reserve\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n75,734,060\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n54,231,372\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n34,713,982\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n20,151,823\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n23,558,893\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nNon-earning assets\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n22,316,912\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n22,123,529\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n22,084,219\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n9,772,320\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n13,466,177\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTotal average assets\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n589,379,985\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n502,628,318\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n440,615,140\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n430,495,412\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n428,174,359\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Including\nmortgage loans to be sold and deferred fees.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe continued to experience growth in our interest-bearing deposits\nat the Federal Reserve subsequent to December 31, 2021.

of December 31, 2021, we had fifteen U.S.\nTreasury Notes and nineteen Municipal Securities with an unrealized loss of $1.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, we had no U.S. Treasury Notes or Municipal Securities with an unrealized loss.

The unrealized losses on\nthese securities are related to changes in the interest rate environment from the date of purchase. The contractual terms of these\ninvestments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment. Therefore,\nthese investments are not considered other-than-temporarily impaired.

The Board of Directors of the Bank reviews the entire investment portfolio at each regular monthly meeting, including\nany purchases, sales, calls, and maturities during the previous month.\u00a0 Furthermore, the Credit Department conducts a financial\nunderwriting assessment of all municipal securities and their corresponding municipalities annually and management reviews the\nassessments.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLOAN PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe focus our lending activities on small\nand middle market businesses, professionals and individuals in our geographic market.

In this statement,\nthe regulatory agencies expressed their view of loan modification programs as positive actions that may mitigate adverse effects\non borrowers due to COVID-19 and that the agencies will not criticize institutions for working with borrowers in a safe and sound\nmanner. Moreover, the revised statement provides that eligible loan modifications related to COVID-19 may be accounted for under\nsection 4013 of the CARES Act or in accordance with ASC 310-40. Under Section 4013 of the CARES Act, banks may elect not to categorize\nloan modifications as TDRs if the modifications are related to COVID-19, executed on a loan that was not more than 30 days past\ndue as of December 31, 2019, and executed between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of December 31, 2020 or 60 days after the date\nof termination of the National Emergency. All short-term loan modifications made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19\nto borrowers who were current prior to any relief are not considered TDRs. Beginning in March 2020, the Bank provided payment accommodations\nto customers, consisting of 60-day principal deferral to borrowers negatively impacted by COVID-19. The Bank has examined the payment\naccommodations granted to borrowers in response to COVID-19 and classified 9 loans, with an aggregate loan balance of $4.0 million,\nthat were granted payment accommodations as TDRs given the continued financial difficulty of the customer, associated industry\nrisk, and multiple deferral requests. As of December 31, 2021, 4 of the TDRs were removed from TDR status due to improvement in\nfinancial condition and sustained performance under the restructured terms, 2 TDRs were paid off through refinancing into new loans\nat market terms, and 1 TDR was paid off. Two loans with a balance of $0.5 million remain in TDR status as of December 31, 2021.\nThe Bank will continue to examine payment accommodations as requested by the borrowers.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe allowance for loan losses represents\nour estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses (the \u201callowance\u201d)\nis reviewed by the Loan Committee and by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. For purposes of this analysis, adequacy is\ndefined as a level sufficient to absorb estimated losses in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date presented. To remain\nconsistent with GAAP, the methodology employed for this analysis has been modified over the years to reflect the economic environment\nand new accounting pronouncements. The Credit Department reviews this calculation on a quarterly basis. In addition, an independent\nthird party validates the allowance calculation on a periodic basis. The methodology is based on a reserve model that is comprised\nof the three components listed below:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1)\n\n\nSpecific reserve analysis for impaired loans based on FASB ASC 310-10-35, \nReceivables - Overall\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2)\n\n\nGeneral reserve analysis applying historical loss rates based on FASB ASC 450-20, \nContingencies: Loss Contingencies\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3)\n\n\nQualitative or environmental factors.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLoans greater than $50,000 are reviewed\nfor impairment on a quarterly basis if any of the following criteria are met:\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1)\n\n\nThe loan is on non-accrual\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2)\n\n\nThe loan is a troubled debt restructuring\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3)\n\n\nThe loan is over 60 days past due\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4)\n\n\nThe loan is rated sub-standard, doubtful, or loss\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5)\n\n\nExcessive principal extensions are executed\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n6)\n\n\nIf we are provided information that indicates we will not collect all principal and interest as scheduled\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nImpairment is measured by the present value\nof the future cash flow discounted at the loan\u2019s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan\nis collateral dependent.

This analysis includes a pool of loans that are reviewed for impairment but are not found\nto be impaired.

The five-year average loss ratio by loan type is then used to calculate the estimated loss based on the current balance\nof each group.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nQualitative and environmental loss factors\nare also applied against the portfolio, excluding impaired loans. These factors include external risk factors that we believe are\nrepresentative of our overall lending environment.

We are satisfied with the stability of the past due and non-performing loans and believe there has been no\ndecline in the quality of our loan portfolio due to any trend in delinquent or adversely classified loans. Sizable unsecured principal\nbalances on a non-amortizing basis are monitored. Although the vast majority of our real estate loans are underwritten on a cash\nflow basis, the secondary source of repayment is typically tied to our ability to realize the conversion of the collateral to cash. Accordingly, we closely\nmonitor loan to value ratios. The maximum collateral advance rate is 80% on all real estate transactions, with the exception of\nraw land at 65% and land development at 70%.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOccasionally, we extend credit beyond our\nnormal collateral advance margins in real estate lending. We refer to these loans as over-margined real estate loans. Although\ninfrequent, the aggregate of these loans represents a notable part of our portfolio. Accordingly, these loans are monitored and\nthe balances reported to the Board of Directors every quarter. An excessive level of this practice (as a percentage of capital)\ncould result in additional regulatory scrutiny, competitive disadvantages and potential losses if forced to convert the collateral.\nThe consideration of over-margined real estate loans directly relates to the capacity of the borrower to repay. We often request\nadditional collateral to bring the loan to value ratio within the policy objectives and require a strong secondary source of repayment.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough significantly under our policy\nthreshold of 100% of capital (currently approximately $53.9 million), the amount of over-margined real estate loans currently totals\napproximately $1.5 million or approximately 0.48% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2021 compared to $2.9 million or approximately\n0.89% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2020.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA credit rating matrix is used to rate\nall extensions of credit and to provide a more specific picture of the risk each loan poses to the quality of the loan portfolio.\nThere are eight possible ratings used to determine the quality of each loan based on the following characteristics: cash flow,\ncollateral quality, guarantor strength, financial condition, management quality, operating performance, the relevancy of the financial\nstatements, historical loan performance, debt coverage ratio, and the borrower\u2019s leverage position. The matrix is designed\nto meet our standards and expectations of loan quality. It is based on experience with similarly graded loans, industry best practices,\nand regulatory guidance. Our loan portfolio is graded in its entirety, with the exception of PPP loans. Because PPP loans are 100%\nguaranteed by the SBA and did not undergo the Bank\u2019s typical underwriting process, they are not graded.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNational and local economic trends\nand conditions \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nNational and local economic trends and\nconditions are constantly changing and both positively and negatively impact borrowers. Most macroeconomic conditions are not controllable\nby us and are incorporated into the qualitative risk factors. Natural and environmental disasters, including the rise of sea levels,\npolitical uncertainty, increasing levels of consumer price inflation, supply-chain disruptions and international instability are\na few of the trends and conditions that are currently affecting the national and local economies. Additionally, the national and\nlocal economy has been affected by COVID-19 during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. These changes have impacted borrowers\u2019\nability, in many cases, to repay loans in a timely manner. On occasion, a loan\u2019s primary source of repayment (i.e. personal\nincome, cash flow, or lease income) may be eroded as a result of unemployment, lack of revenues, or the inability of a tenant to\nmake rent payments.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEffects of changes in risk selection\nand underwriting practices \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe quality of our loan portfolio is contingent\nupon our risk selection and underwriting practices. All new loans (except for mortgage loans in the process of being sold to investors\nand loans secured by properly margined negotiable securities traded on an established market or other cash collateral) with exposure\nover $300,000 are reviewed by the Loan Committee on a monthly basis. The Board of Directors review credits over $750,000 monthly.\nAnnual credit analyses are conducted on credits over $500,000 upon the receipt of updated financial information. Prior to extensions\nof credit, significant loan opportunities go through sound credit underwriting. Our Credit Department conducts a detailed cash\nflow analysis on each proposal using the most current financial information.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nExperience, ability and depth of\nlending management staff \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nWe have over 300 combined years of lending\nexperience among our lending staff. We are aware of the many challenges currently facing the banking industry. As other banks look\nto increase earnings in the short term, we will continue to emphasize the need to maintain safe and sound lending practices and\ncore deposit growth managed with a long-term perspective.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIndustry conditions\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThere continues to be an influx of new\nbanks and consolidation of existing banks in our geographic area, which creates pricing competition. We believe that our borrowing\nbase is well established and therefore unsound price competition is not necessary.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEffects of changes in credit concentrations\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe risks associated with the effects of\nchanges in credit concentration include loan, geographic and regulatory concentrations. As of December 31, 2021, one Standard Industrial\nCode group, activities related to real estate, comprised more than 2% of our total outstanding loans.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEffects of changes in geographic\nconcentrations\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nWe are located along the east coast of\nthe United States and on an earthquake fault line, increasing the chances that a natural disaster may impact our borrowers and\nus. We have a Disaster Recovery Plan in place; however, the amount of time it would take for our customers to return to normal\noperations is unknown. Our plan is reviewed and tested annually.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLoan and credit administration risk\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nLoan and credit administration risk includes\ncollateral documentation, insurance risk and maintaining financial information risk.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe majority of our loan portfolio is collateralized\nwith a variety of our borrowers\u2019 assets. The execution and monitoring of the documentation to properly secure the loan is\nthe responsibility of our lenders and loan department. We require insurance coverage naming us as the mortgagee or loss payee.\nAlthough insurance risk is also considered collateral documentation risk, the actual coverage, amounts of coverage and increased\ndeductibles are important to management.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFinancial Information Risk includes a function\nof time during which the borrower\u2019s financial condition may change; therefore, keeping financial information up to date is\nimportant to us. Our policy requires all new loans (with a credit exposure of $10,000 or more), regardless of the customer\u2019s\nhistory with us, to have updated financial information. In addition, we monitor appraisals closely as real estate values are appreciating.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBased on our analysis of the adequacy of\nthe allowance for loan loss model, we recorded a provision for loan loss of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared\nto $0.2 million for the year ended December\u00a031,\u00a02020. At December 31, 2021, the five-year average loss ratios were: 0.17%\nCommercial, 0.00% Commercial Real Estate Construction, -0.01% Commercial Real Estate Other, -0.03% Consumer Real Estate, and 0.54%\nConsumer Other.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021,\ncharge-offs of $20,990 and recoveries of $0.1 million were recorded to the allowance for loan losses, resulting in an allowance\nfor loan losses of $4.4 million or 1.43% of total loans at December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, charge-offs\nof $0.3 million and recoveries of $0.2 million were recorded to the allowance for loan losses, resulting in an allowance for loan\nlosses of $4.2 million or 1.30% of total loans at December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, the allowance for loan losses was\n1.47% of total loans less PPP loans. PPP loans are 100% guaranteed by the SBA; therefore, these loans do not have an associated\nreserve. We believe loss exposure in the portfolio is identified, reserved against, and closely monitored to ensure that economic\nchanges are promptly addressed in the analysis of reserve adequacy.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe accrual of interest is generally discontinued\non loans which become 90 days past due as to principal or interest. The accrual of interest on some loans may continue even though\nthey are 90 days past due if the loans are well secured or in the process of collection and we deem it appropriate. If non-accrual\nloans decrease their past due status to less than 30 days for a period of six to nine months, they are reviewed individually to\ndetermine if they should be returned to accrual status. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no loans over 90 days past due\nstill accruing interest.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n30\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe following table represents a

believe the allowance for loan losses\nat December 31, 2021 is adequate to cover estimated losses in the loan portfolio; however, assessing the adequacy of the allowance\nis a process that requires considerable judgment. Our judgments are based on numerous assumptions about current events that we\nbelieve to be reasonable, but may or may not be valid. Thus, there can be no assurance that loan losses in future periods will\nnot exceed the current allowance amount or that future increases in the allowance will not be required. No assurance can be given\nthat our ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio in light of changing economic conditions and other relevant circumstances will\nnot require significant future additions to the allowance, thus adversely affecting our operating results.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe following table presents a breakdown of the allowance for\nloan losses for the past five years.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n2021\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n2020\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n2019\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n2018\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n2017\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n$\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n%\n(1)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n$\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n%\n(1)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n$\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n%\n(1)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n$\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n%\n(1)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n$\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n%\n(1)\n\n\n\n\n(in thousands)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nCommercial\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n796\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n15\n%\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n1,030\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n16\n%\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n1,430\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n19\n%\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n1,665\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n20\n%\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n1,404\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n20\n%\n\n\n\n\nCommercial Real Estate Construction\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n175\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n4\n%\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n199\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n5\n%\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n109\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n5\n%\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n64\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n3\n%\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n23\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n3\n%\n\n\n\n\nCommercial Real Estate Other\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n2,376\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n54\n%\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n1,909\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n46\n%\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n1,271\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n52\n%\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n1,292\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n52\n%\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n1,550\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n52\n%\n\n\n\n\nConsumer Real Estate\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n925\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n23\n%\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n925\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n22\n%\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n496\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n22\n%\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n387\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n23\n%\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n797\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n23\n%\n\n\n\n\nConsumer Other\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n105\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n1\n%\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n123\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n1\n%\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n698\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n2\n%\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n806\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n2\n%\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n101\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n2\n%\n\n\n\n\nPaycheck Protection Program\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n3\n%\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n10\n%\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n%\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n4,377\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n100\n%\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n4,186\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n100\n%\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n4,004\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n100\n%\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n4,214\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n100\n%\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n3,875\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n100\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Loan\ncategory as a percentage of total loans.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe allowance is also subject to examination\ntesting by regulatory agencies, which may consider such factors as the methodology used to determine adequacy and the size of the allowance\nrelative to that of peer institutions and other adequacy tests.

We have a Borrower-In-Custody arrangement with the\nFederal Reserve. This arrangement permits the Company to retain possession of loans pledged as collateral to secure advances from\nthe Federal Reserve Discount Window. Under this agreement, we may borrow up to $72.1 million. We established this arrangement\nas an additional source of liquidity. There have been no borrowings under this arrangement.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAt\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, the Bank had unused short-term lines of credit totaling approximately $41 million and $23 million,\nrespectively (which are withdrawable at the lender\u2019s option).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOFF-BALANCE\nSHEET ARRANGEMENTS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn\nthe normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with GAAP, are not recorded\nin the financial statements, or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts. These transactions involve, to\nvarying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate, and liquidity risk. We use such transactions for general corporate purposes\nor customer needs. General corporate purpose transactions are used to help manage credit, interest rate and liquidity risk or\nto optimize capital. Customer transactions are used to manage customer requests for funding.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur\noff-balance sheet arrangements consist principally of commitments to extend credit described below. We estimate probable losses\nrelated to binding unfunded lending commitments and record a reserve for unfunded lending commitments in other liabilities on\nthe consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the balance of this reserve was $44,912.\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had no interests in non-consolidated special purpose entities.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCommitments\nto extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.\nCommitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of\nthe commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future\ncash requirements. The amount of collateral obtained if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit is based on our\ncredit evaluation of the borrower. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, negotiable instruments, inventory,\nproperty, plant and equipment, and real estate. Commitments to extend credit, including unused lines of credit, amounted to $117.5\nmillion and $122.8 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nStandby\nletters of credit represent our obligation to a third-party contingent upon the failure of our customer to perform under the terms\nof an underlying contract with the third party or obligates us to guarantee or stand as surety for the benefit of the third party.\nThe underlying contract may entail either financial or nonfinancial obligations and may involve such things as the shipment of\ngoods, performance of a contract, or repayment of an obligation. Under the terms of a standby letter, generally drafts will be\ndrawn only when the underlying event fails to occur as intended. We can seek recovery of the amounts paid from the borrower. Commitments\nunder standby letters of credit are usually for one year or less. The maximum potential amount of undiscounted future payments\nrelated to standby letters of credit at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $0.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\noriginate certain fixed rate residential loans and commit these loans for sale. The commitments to originate fixed rate residential\nloans and the sales commitments are freestanding derivative instruments. We had forward sales commitments, totaling $2.8 million\nat December 31, 2021, to sell loans held for sale of $2.8 million, compared to forward sales commitments of $13.0 million at\u00a0December\u00a031,\u00a02020,\nto sell loans held for sale of $13.0 million. The fair value of these commitments was not significant at December 31, 2021 or\n2020. We had no embedded derivative instruments requiring separate accounting treatment.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOnce\nwe sell certain fixed rate residential loans, the loans are no longer reportable on our balance sheet. With most of these sales,\nwe have an obligation to repurchase the loan in the event of a default of principal or interest on the loan. This recourse period\nranges from three to nine months. Misrepresentation or fraud carries unlimited time for recourse. The unpaid principal balance\nof loans sold with recourse was $30.8 million at December 31, 2021 and $57.2 million at December 31, 2020. For the years\nended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, there were no loans repurchased.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEFFECT\nOF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe\nconsolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require the measurement of financial position\nand results of operations in terms of historical dollars without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing power over\ntime due to inflation.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnlike\nmost other industries, the assets and liabilities of financial institutions like the Company are primarily monetary in nature.\nAs a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of\ninflation and changes in prices. In addition, interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude\nas the prices of goods and services. We strive to manage the relationship between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities\nin order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations, including those resulting from inflation.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n35\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCAPITAL\nRESOURCES\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur\ncapital needs have been met to date through the $10.6 million in capital raised in our initial offering, the retention of earnings\nless dividends paid and the exercise of options to purchase stock. Total shareholders\u2019 equity at December 31, 2021 was $53.9\nmillion. The rate of asset growth since our inception has not negatively impacted our capital base.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn\nJuly 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve Board approved the final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\u2019s\n(\u201cBCBS\u201d) capital guidelines for U.S. banks (\u201cBasel III\u201d). Following the actions by the Federal Reserve,\nthe FDIC also approved regulatory capital requirements on July 9, 2013. The FDIC\u2019s rule is identical in substance to the\nfinal rules issued by the Federal Reserve Bank.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBasel\nIII became effective on January 1, 2015. The purpose is to improve the quality and increase the quantity of capital for all banking\norganizations. The minimum requirements for the quantity and quality of capital were increased. The rule includes a new common\nequity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5% and a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of\nrisk-weighted assets. The rule also raises the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4% to 6% and requires\na minimum leverage ratio of 4%. In addition, the rule also implements strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments\nand improves the methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity. Full compliance with all of the\nfinal rule requirements will be phased in over a multi-year schedule.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn\nNovember 4, 2019, the federal banking agencies jointly issued a final rule on an optional, simplified measure of capital adequacy for\nqualifying community banking organizations called the community bank leverage ratio (\u201cCBLR\u201d) framework effective on January\n1, 2020. A qualifying community banking organization is defined as having less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, a leverage\nratio greater than 9%, off-balance sheet exposures of 25% or less of total consolidated assets, and trading assets and liabilities of\n5% or less of total consolidated assets.
