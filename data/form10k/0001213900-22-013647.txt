{"item1": ">Item 1. Business\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBUSINESS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are a blank check company incorporated in November 2020 as a Cayman\nIslands exempted company for the purpose of effecting an initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe intend to focus our efforts on seeking and completing an initial\nbusiness combination with a company that has an enterprise value of between $1.0 billion and $3.0 billion, although a target entity with\na smaller or larger enterprise value may be considered. While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business industry or sector,\nwe intend to capitalize on the ability of our combined team to identify, acquire and add value to a business following the initial business\ncombination. The industry sectors that we have targeted and intend to continue to target, many of which are undergoing technology-driven\ntransformation, include consumer, food, branded products, e-commerce and retail disruptors and consumerization of healthcare, as well\nas certain service sectors and the technology underlying and driving changes across these sectors and related industries. We believe that\nthe characteristics and capabilities of our combined team make us an attractive partner to potential target businesses, enhance our ability\nto complete a successful business combination and bring value to the business post-business combination. We believe these capabilities\nwere demonstrated in our combined team\u2019s successful sourcing and completion of GPAC\u2019s merger with Purple, as well as our significant\nwork with Purple since the closing of the merger.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company brings together three elements that we believe create a\ncompetitive advantage which differentiates us from other acquisition vehicles in the market, and significantly improve our chances of\ncompleting a successful business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1.\n\n\nProven executive team, led by our Chairman and CEO Paul J. Zepf;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2.\n\n\nValue-added strategic partnership with XRC Labs, as well as a deep \u201cecosystem\u201d of executive and corporate relationships and resources; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3.\n\n\nOur less dilutive and more aligned APEX \u2122 SPAC structure.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe believe the combined team possesses an ideal mix of core characteristics\nfor a special purpose acquisition corporation. This combined team includes what we view to be successful dealmakers or operators, with\nexperience across multiple deal types, including complicated special situations and as senior operators across a variety of businesses\nand industries. This combined team has demonstrable experience and valuable contracts across a wide range of industries and business lines,\nwhich we believe will allow us to source deals that other investors could not. The combined team also has what we believe is a longstanding\ntrack record of value creation, both as investors and for investors, across the gamut of private equity or direct public and private company\ninvesting. Our network and current affiliations across the team will allow us to lean heavily on an existing infrastructure of resources\nthat will assist in due diligence, underwriting and ultimately structuring an acquisition. We may also leverage our Advisory Group as\nneeded.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWith respect to the foregoing examples, past performance by our management\nteam or sponsor team is not a guarantee either (i) of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate or (ii)\u00a0that\nwe will be able to locate a suitable candidate for our initial business combination. Furthermore, in considering any past performance\ninformation contained herein, you should bear in mind that actual returns depend on, among other factors, future operating results, the\nvalue of the investments and market conditions at the time of disposition, any related transaction costs and the timing and manner of\nsale, all of which may differ from the assumptions on which the overall performance of any prior investments are based.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nOur Management Team \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have assembled a number of seasoned corporate executives and professional\nadvisors to serve as our executive officers and directors, alongside Mr. Zepf. Because we are likely to be actively involved in the strategy\nand operations of our target companies (although there can be no assurances that we will be), our directors have been chosen for their\nextensive sector and executive experience in managing successful companies. In addition to providing us with strategic insights, which\ninclude in-depth knowledge of industry dynamics, competition and operational capabilities, our independent directors will provide access\nto their broad networks of operating executives and other resources. For more information about our executive officers and directors,\nplease see Part III, Item 10 of this report, \u201cDirectors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur Advisory Group\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition to our management team and board of directors, we have\nassembled an experienced team of strategic partners and individuals (our \u201cAdvisory Group\u201d) to assist in the sourcing, evaluation,\ndue diligence, deal execution, and post-closing strategic involvement with potential business combination partners. Members of the Advisory\nGroup have also invested in our sponsor. We believe the operational expertise of the Advisory Group is a differentiating element of our\napproach, which gives us the opportunity to pursue potential business combination targets in several industry sectors where we have expertise,\nand increases our likelihood of finding and completing a suitable business combination. The Advisory Group consists of individuals with\nspecific experience in a broad range of industry sectors, including technology, retail, consumer goods, industrials and the food &\nhospitality sectors because we believe that examining acquisition opportunities across all of these sectors increases the likelihood of\nfinding an acquisition target that will lead to shareholder value creation. In addition, members of the Advisory Group include professionals\nwho have been successful chief executive officers, senior executives and board members of public and private companies, and we believe\nthey will enhance our value proposition to potential business combination partners given their collective expertise, operational and strategic\ncapabilities and track record in their respective sectors. Members of the Advisory Group also may be managers of pools of capital, and\nmay be helpful in providing or obtaining financing, if such financing is necessary, in connection with our initial business combination,\nalthough there can be no assurance that they will do so. The Advisory Group has experience in:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nOperating companies, setting and changing strategies and capital allocation and identifying, monitoring and recruiting world-class talent;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nAcquiring and integrating companies;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nAdvising businesses in their digital transformation efforts and helping them grow in the digital age;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nEmbarking on corporate turnarounds and implementing transformational long-term strategies; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nDeveloping and growing companies, both organically and through acquisitions and strategic transactions and expanding the product range and geographic footprint of businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe members of the Advisory Group include the following individuals:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nDavid Chamberlain:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0David Chamberlain is currently a managing partner at Eaglepoint Advisors. He previously served as CEO of Stride Rite Corporation, Genesco and Shaklee Corporation and held senior management positions at Nabisco Brands and Quaker Oats.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nMark Drever:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mark Drever is currently CEO of Organic Girl and is a member of the board of directors of Musco Family Olive Company. He previously served as president of Fresh Express and was a member of the board of directors of Oberto Brands.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nNeal D. Goldman:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Neal Goldman is a partner at Eaglepoint Advisors. He previously served as chief legal and regulatory officer at Skype and chief administrative and legal officer at 3Com and Polaroid.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nAdam Gray:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adam Gray is a managing partner and co-founder of Coliseum Capital Management and also serves on the board of Purple. He is on the board of directors at Pas Group Limited and previously held board positions at Blue Bird Corporation, DEI Holding and Benihana.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nMichael Johnston:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Michael Johnston is currently a partner at Eaglepoint Advisors and serves on the board of directors at Whirlpool Corporation, Dover Corp. and Armstrong World Industries. He previously was CEO of Visteon Corporation and held leadership roles at Johnson Controls.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nJoseph B. Megibow:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Joseph Megibow was Chief Executive Officer of Purple from October 2018 to December 2021. He previously held senior management roles Joyus, Inc., American Eagle Outfitters and Expedia.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nJeffrey Weiss:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jeffrey Weiss is currently the CEO of Smart Financial and Loanmart, two Fortress Investment Group portfolio companies. He previously served as founder and CEO of Cloverdale Press and was the founding editor of Country Living Magazine.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nStrategic Partner\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nXRC Labs was formed by our director, Pano Anthos, in 2015 in order\nto disrupt the consumer goods and retail industries by investing in 20+ early stage startups per year. XRC\u2019s mission is to foster\ncompanies and products that innovate the face of consumer goods, ecommerce, retail and related sectors in a rapidly changing marketplace.\nTo support these innovation and startups, XRC has built an ecosystem of nine major corporate and over 200 affiliate partners, ten fund\nadvisors, 300 industry mentors, and 3 national industry trade organizations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nXRC\u2019s corporate partners represent a leading mix of brands, retailers\nand third party providers. CVS Health, MasterCard, Intel, TJX, Accenture, Lowes, Estee Lauder and GS1 US have financially supported XRC\nto provide them with access to future innovation, connections through the network, new business models and thought leadership. Regularly,\nthese partners pilot our new programs or companies and provide access to leading brands and retailers.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nXRC\u2019s industry mentors include former CEO\u2019s and executives\nof major brands across the ecommerce, tech, payments and retail sectors. This deep bench of successful entrepreneurs and industry specialists\nprovides us with access to all of the resources that make disruptive companies successful, including branding, growth development, product\ndevelopment, etc.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe believe that the value-added resources from XRC\u2019s network,\nincluding the corporate sponsors, will provide us with a unique and differentiated ability to source opportunities, will enhance our attractiveness\nto potential merger targets, and will provide us with a greater ability to add value to the target company post-merger. XRC and its partners\u2019\ntechnology and \u201cconvergence\u201d experience should be applicable across multiple industry sectors, including but not limited to\ntechnology, consumer, retail, food, healthcare and many types of services and production businesses.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBusiness Strategy\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur strategy is to build on three key pillars: an experienced management\nteam led by Mr. Zepf; our value-added partners in our sponsor, XRC and our advisory group members; and a next generation, more efficient\nand aligned APEX \u2122 SPAC structure.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur sponsor team\u2019s expertise in consumer, branded products, technology,\nfood, e-commerce and retail, and healthcare and multiple service industries, many of which are undergoing technology-driven transformation,\npositions us well to source, execute and add value to companies in these sectors. Across these sectors, we intend to leverage our experience\nwith digital \u201cconvergence\u201d and disruption, supply chain management and product development, as well as our demonstrated ability\nto work with companies to drive profitable growth.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe believe the combined team possesses the core characteristics of\nan ideal team for a special purpose acquisition corporation. This combined team is a mix of what we view to be successful dealmakers or\noperators, with experience across multiple deal types, including complicated special situations and as senior operators across a variety\nof businesses and industries. This combined team has built a meaningful proprietary deal-sourcing network that should allow us to source\ndeals that other investors could not. Through these endeavors, this combined team has what we believe is a long standing track record\nof value creation, both as investors and for investors, across the gamut of public and private company investing. Our network and current\naffiliations across the team will allow us to lean heavily on an existing infrastructure of resources that will assist in due diligence,\nunderwriting and ultimately structuring an acquisition. We also intend to leverage our network of third party advisors as needed.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSource\n: Our sourcing and acquisition selection process will\nleverage our sponsor group\u2019s deep, broad and trusted network of industry, private equity sponsor, investment banking and lending\ncommunity relationships, as well as their relationships with family-led and founder-led private companies. Our supportive value-added\napproach, and ability to work with strategic partners within our network, such as XRC\u2019s corporate sponsors, should make us an attractive\nmerger partner to many potential merger targets. Furthermore, our team\u2019s success with GPAC will likely further differentiate us\nfrom the other vehicles in the market, the majority of which are raised by sponsors who have no prior experience with SPAC transactions.\nWe also believe this should provide us with a breadth of business combination opportunities, typically outside of a broad investment banking\nauction process. Finally, we believe that our less dilutive and more aligned APEX \u2122 SPAC structure will make us an attractive merger\npartner, thereby enhancing our sourcing capabilities.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nExecute\n: We have extensive deal execution experience and capabilities.\nIn addition to leading the completion of GPAC\u2019s merger with Purple, our CEO, Mr. Zepf, has more than 30 years of experience executing\nnegotiated private and public company investments, mergers and acquisitions, as well as initial public offerings, including while at Morgan\nStanley, Lazard, Golub Capital and TowerBrook. Mr. Zepf\u2019s execution experience is complemented by directors Mr. Anthos and Mr. DiCamillo,\namong others. Mr. Anthos has extensive experience investing in consumer goods and retail companies via his leadership at XRC Labs and\nFunds, as well as his role at Eaglepoint as the head of digital transformation. Mr. DiCamillo has been the managing partner of Eaglepoint\nAdvisors, LLC, a privately held advisor to boards and chief executive officers in matters of strategy, organization and the management\nof business transition issues. Collectively, our leadership team will draw upon several decades of execution experience across a broad\nrange of industries and markets.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOperate and Grow\n: The experience and capabilities of our combined\nteam should allow us to drive growth in shareholder value following the business combination. The prior experience of the members of our\ncombined team includes working with companies and increasing value for all stakeholders at the senior management level, as consultants,\nas board members and as constructive minority stake shareholders. Additionally, we intend to seek ways to work with XRC\u2019s corporate\npartners to drive growth in the target company post-business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWith respect to the foregoing examples, past performance by our management\nteam or sponsor team is not a guarantee either (i) of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate or (ii)\u00a0that\nwe will be able to locate a suitable candidate for our initial business combination. Furthermore, in considering any past performance\ninformation contained herein, you should bear in mind that actual returns depend on, among other factors, future operating results, the\nvalue of the investments and market conditions at the time of disposition, any related transaction costs and the timing and manner of\nsale, all of which may differ from the assumptions on which the overall performance of any prior investments are based.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAcquisition Criteria\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe target business combination opportunities that align with our strategic\ninsights, focus, capabilities and network. Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and\nguidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. While we will use these criteria and guidelines\nin evaluating acquisition opportunities, we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does\nnot meet these criteria and guidelines.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe seek to acquire companies exhibiting one or more of the characteristics\nbelow:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nValue-Added Capital for Growth and/or Consolidation Opportunities:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our combined team has significant and successful experience in investing in and working with companies that are achieving rapid and profitable growth through (a) organic growth initiatives; and/or (b) strategic consolidation opportunities. We will target companies whose owners may not have the requisite capital or experience to take advantage of compelling corporate development opportunities. Our combined team also has experience expanding companies\u2019 markets and operations outside of the United States, and we believe our cross-border capabilities could be attractive to many potential middle market business combination targets.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nOperational Improvements:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our combined team has significant and successful experience in investing in and working with companies where there is an opportunity to effect meaningful operational improvements. Members of our management team and sponsor team have worked with those types of companies as investors, board members, consultants and senior management. We intend to tailor our approach to working with the target company\u2019s management team and owners to fit the unique challenges and opportunities they face. Our combined team has the versatility and flexibility to allow us to provide strategic guidance as board members and consultants or members take on direct senior leadership roles to drive operational improvements at the target company.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\n\u201cPartnership\u201d Sale:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We may seek to acquire one or more companies with a current owner, whether founder-owned or family-owned or institutionally owned (private equity or venture capital), who would like to retain a meaningful stake in the company to preserve and enhance potential upside. As a provider of public equity capital, we are well positioned to provide liquidity and a long-term capital solution, and expect that potential merger targets and partners would view having our combined team as significant, supportive shareholders with a successful SPAC track record as a positive factor. We also could be an attractive financial and operating partner for a private equity firm that sees compelling acquisition opportunities but may be already fully invested.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nTechnology-Driven Change and Opportunity:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Many companies in our targeted industry sectors have significant challenges and opportunities resulting from rapid technology-driven change. Our combined team has deep experience in working with companies to mitigate the risks and optimize the opportunities from technology-driven change. We believe these capabilities make us an attractive merger partner.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nDeleveraging:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our combined team\u2019s extensive relationships with lenders and private equity firms, as well as their prior experience in making deleveraging investments, should position us well to source and execute a recapitalizing acquisition. As opposed to many distressed debt funds/investors, we believe we would be a preferred refinancing/de-leveraging solution to owners and management teams of middle-market companies.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nA SPAC Business Combination as an Advantageous Liquidity Alternative:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At times, the IPO market is uncertain or closed, so an acquisition by us could be a better means of going public for a target. Further, a target company\u2019s owners and/or management might not have experience going public or as a public company and could view our management team and sponsor experience with a successful SPAC track record as an important value-added factor. Additionally, certain businesses may not be an ideal candidate for a mergers and acquisitions auction process, so a negotiated acquisition by us could offer a better means of providing liquidity for the target business\u2019s current owners.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThese criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. We may or may not\nconsummate our business combination with a company that exhibits all or any of the qualities above. Any evaluation relating to the merits\nof a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations,\nfactors and criteria that our sponsors and management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into a business combination\nwith a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the\nabove criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this report, would\nbe in the form of proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we would file with the SEC. Although we are focused\non identifying business combination candidates in sectors including the consumer, food, branded products, e-commerce and retail disruptors\nand consumerization of healthcare, as well as certain service sectors and the technology underlying and driving changes across these sectors\nand related industries described above, we will consider a business combination candidate outside of these industries if we determine\nthat such candidate offers an attractive opportunity for our Company.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination\nwith a company that is affiliated with members of our management team or their affiliates. In the event we seek to complete our initial\nbusiness combination with a company that is affiliated with our management team or their affiliates, we, or a committee of independent\ndirectors, will obtain an opinion from an independent accounting firm or an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA\nthat our initial business combination is fair to our Company from a financial point of view.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInitial Business Combination\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSo long as our securities are then listed on Nasdaq, our initial business\ncombination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets\nheld in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account)\nat the time of signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. We refer to this as the 80% of fair\nmarket value test. If our securities are no longer listed on Nasdaq, we will not be obligated to satisfy the 80% of fair market value\ntest. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. The fair market\nvalue of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors, based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the\nfinancial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value.) Even though our board of directors will\nrely on generally accepted standards, our board of directors will have discretion to select the standards employed. In addition, the application\nof the standards generally involves a substantial degree of judgment. Accordingly, investors will be relying on the business judgment\nof the board of directors in evaluating the fair market value of the target or targets. The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer\ndocuments we use in connection with any proposed initial business combination will provide public shareholders with our analysis of our\nsatisfaction of the 80% of fair market value test, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board is not able to determine\nthe fair market value of the target business independently, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an\nindependent valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board\nwill be unable to make an independent determination of the fair market value of a target business, it may be unable to do so if: (1)\u00a0our\nboard is less familiar or inexperienced with the target company\u2019s business, (2)\u00a0there is a significant amount of uncertainty\nas to the value of the company\u2019s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations\nor growth, or (3) if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills, and our board determines\nthat outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that\nthe fair market value of the target business meets the 80% of fair market value test, unless such opinion includes material information\nregarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would\nbe distributed to our shareholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to shareholders and\nfile with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that\nthe post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or\nassets of the target business. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-business combination company\nowns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management\nteam or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company\nowns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target\nsufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment\nCompany Act\u201d). Even if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target,\nour shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company,\ndepending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which\nwe issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of\na target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial\nnumber of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding\nshares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses\nare owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is\nwhat will be valued for purposes of the 80% of fair market value test. If the business combination involves more than one target business,\nthe 80% of fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. In addition, we have agreed not\nto enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor. If our securities\nare not then listed on Nasdaq for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% of fair market value test.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company\nor business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent\nin such company or business. Although our management team will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business,\nwe cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure\nand complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree\nof certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial\nbusiness combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete\nanother business combination\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAcquisition Process\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn evaluating a potential target business, we expect to conduct a due\ndiligence review to seek to determine a company\u2019s quality and its intrinsic value. That due diligence review may include, among\nother things, financial statement analysis, detailed document reviews, multiple meetings with management (which may be virtual or in person),\nconsultations with relevant industry experts, competitors, customers and suppliers, as well as a review of additional information that\nwe will seek to obtain as part of our analysis of a target company.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination\nwith a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination\nwith a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an\nopinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to\nour Company from a financial point of view.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMembers of our management team, including our officers and directors,\ndirectly or indirectly own our securities and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target\ncompany is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Each of our officers and directors, as well\nas management team, may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation\nof any such officers, directors and management team members was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect\nto such business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEach of our directors and officers presently has, and any of them in\nthe future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or\nwill be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business\ncombination opportunity that is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or\nshe will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. We do not believe, however,\nthat the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial\nbusiness combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides\nthat we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered\nto such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our Company, and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually\npermitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer\nthat opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur Founder, sponsor, officers and directors may sponsor, form or participate\nin other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies\nmay present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target, particularly in the event there is overlap among investment\nmandates. However, we do not currently expect that any such other blank check company would materially affect our ability to complete\nour initial business combination. In addition, our Founder, sponsor, officers and directors are not required to commit any specified amount\nof time to our affairs and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities,\nincluding identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur distributable redeemable warrants provide our public shareholders\nwith an incentive not to redeem their Class A ordinary shares in connection with our initial business combination. Public shareholders\nwho choose to redeem their shares will lose the right to receive distributable redeemable warrants. Public shareholders who choose not\nto redeem their shares will receive one-sixth of a distributable redeemable warrant per public share they hold (up to a total of 5,000,000\ndistributable redeemable warrants assuming that no public shareholders redeem their Class A ordinary shares). We believe this structure\nmay lead to a lower level of redemptions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nStatus as a Public Company\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe believe our structure make us an attractive business combination\npartner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public\noffering through a merger or other business combination with us. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target\nbusiness may, for example, exchange their shares of stock, shares or other equity interests in the target business for our Class A ordinary\nshares (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our Class A ordinary shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration\nto the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses will find this method a more expeditious and cost effective method\nto becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process often takes a significantly\nlonger period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the initial public\noffering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business\ncombination with us.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFurthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the\ntarget business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters\u2019 ability\nto complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or have negative\nvaluation consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital, an additional means of\nproviding management incentives consistent with shareholders\u2019 interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions.\nBeing a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company\u2019s profile among potential new customers and vendors and\naid in attracting talented employees.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhile we believe that our structure and our management team\u2019s\nbackgrounds make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view our status as a blank check company, such\nas our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek shareholder approval of any proposed initial business combination, negatively.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in Section\n2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various\nreporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but\nnot limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced\ndisclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements\nof holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously\napproved, If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities\nand the prices of our securities may be more volatile.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \u201cemerging\ngrowth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying\nwith new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting\nstandards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended\ntransition period.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1)\nthe last day of the fiscal year (a)\u00a0following January 14, 2026 (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07\nbillion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that\nare held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30\nth\n, and (2) the date on which we have issued\nmore than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFinancial Position\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWith funds available for a business combination initially in the amount\nof approximately $289,500,000 after payment of $10,500,000 of deferred underwriting commissions, we offer a target business a variety\nof options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations\nor strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using\nour cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination\nthat will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken\nany steps to secure third-party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEffecting Our Initial Business Combination\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations\nfor an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our IPO and\nthe sale of the private placement warrants, our equity, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial\nbusiness combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable\nor in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt,\nor not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business\ncombination or used for redemptions of our Class A ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust\naccount for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-business combination company,\nthe payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase\nof other companies or for working capital.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThere is no current basis for investors in us to evaluate the possible\nmerits or risks of the target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination. Although our management\nwill assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, we cannot assure you that this assessment will\nresult in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFurthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning\nthat we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely affect a target business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSources of Target Businesses\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTarget business candidates are brought to our attention from various\nunaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting\nfirms and large business enterprises. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being\nsolicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested\non an unsolicited basis, since some of these sources will have read this report and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our\nofficers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware\nof through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade\nshows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily\nbe available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors. Although we do not presently anticipate engaging\nthe services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these\nfirms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder\u2019s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined\nin an arm\u2019s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management\ndetermines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us\non an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder\u2019s\nfees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account.\nIn no event, however, will our sponsor or any of our existing officers, or their respective affiliates, be paid by us any finder\u2019s\nfee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial\nbusiness combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, we may pay any of our existing directors who are not\nalso officers, or any entity with which they are affiliated, a finder\u2019s fee, consulting fee or other compensation in connection\nwith identifying, investigating and completing our initial business combination, to the extent such payment is in compliance with all\nlaws and is consistent with independent director requirements. Such payment may be paid from the proceeds held in the trust account upon\nconsummation of an initial business combination. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements\nwith the post-business combination company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements\nwill not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination\nwith a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, Founder, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business\ncombination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor or any of our Founder, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent\ndirectors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation\nopinions that such initial business combination is fair to our Company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such\nan opinion in any other context.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEach of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in\nthe future may have, additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities, including entities that are affiliates of our\nsponsor, pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity.\nAccordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to\nwhich he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations\nto present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEvaluation of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial\nBusiness Combination\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a\ndue diligence review which may encompass, as applicable and among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document\nreviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities (subject to any applicable COVID restrictions) and a review of\nfinancial and other information about the target and its industry. We will also utilize our management team\u2019s operational and capital\nplanning experience. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of\nthe business combination transaction.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure\nand complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree\nof certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business\nwith which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds\nwe can use to complete another business combination. We will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or their respective\naffiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination. In addition, we have agreed not to enter\ninto a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLack of Business Diversification\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial\nbusiness combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities\nthat have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we\nwill not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our\ninitial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nsubject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\ncause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLimited Ability to Evaluate the Target\u2019s Management Team\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough we closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target\nbusiness when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target\nbusiness\u2019s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications\nor abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business\ncannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with\nthe combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors\nwill remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote\ntheir full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management\nteam will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior\nmanagement or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with\nthe combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFollowing a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional\nmanagers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit\nadditional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent\nmanagement.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nShareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial\nBusiness Combination\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the\ntender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, we\nwill seek shareholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we may decide to seek shareholder\napproval for business or other reasons.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnder Nasdaq\u2019s listing rules, shareholder approval would typically\nbe required for our initial business combination if, for example:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nWe issue ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of our ordinary shares then-outstanding (other than in a public offering);\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nAny of our directors, officers or substantial security holder (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively having a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in issued and outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 5% or more; or\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nThe issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed\nbusiness combination in those instances in which shareholder approval is not required by law will be made by us, solely in our discretion,\nand will be based on business and reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nthe timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine shareholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek shareholder approval or doing so would place the Company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the Company;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nthe expected cost of holding a shareholder vote;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nthe risk that the shareholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nother time and budget constraints of the Company; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nadditional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to shareholders.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPermitted Purchases and Other Transactions with Respect to Our\nSecurities\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination\nand we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor,\ndirectors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or warrants in privately negotiated transactions\nor in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, at any time at or prior to our initial business combination,\nsubject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material non-public information), our sponsor, directors, executive officers,\nadvisors or their affiliates may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire public shares,\nvote their public shares in favor of our initial business combination or not redeem their public shares. However, they have no current\ncommitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions.\nNone of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase public shares or warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such\ntransactions, they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information\nnot disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their\naffiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption\nrights or submitted a proxy to vote against our initial business combination, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their\nprior elections to redeem their shares and any proxy to vote against our initial business combination. We do not currently anticipate\nthat such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private\ntransaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases\nthat the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will be required to comply with such rules.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe purpose of any such transaction could be to (i) vote in favor of\nthe business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination, (ii) reduce\nthe number of public warrants outstanding or vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection\nwith our initial business combination or (iii) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum\nnet worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would\notherwise not be met. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not\notherwise have been possible.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, if such purchases are made, the public \u201cfloat\u201d\nof our Class A ordinary shares or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced,\nwhich may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate\nthat they may identify the shareholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated\ntransactions by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders (in\nthe case of Class A ordinary shares) following our mailing of tender offer or proxy materials in connection with our initial business\ncombination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private transaction, they\nwould identify and contact only potential selling or redeeming shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for\na pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such shareholder has already submitted\na proxy with respect to our initial business combination but only if such shares have not already been voted at the general meeting related\nto our initial business combination. Our sponsor, executive officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will select which shareholders\nto purchase shares from based on the negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant, and will\nbe restricted from purchasing shares if such purchases do not comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities\nlaws.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will be restricted\nfrom making purchases of shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. We expect any such purchases\nwould be reported by such person pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to\nsuch reporting requirements.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRedemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of\nOur Initial Business Combination\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem\nall or a portion of their Class\u00a0A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable\nin cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation\nof our initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us\nto pay our income taxes, if any, divided by the number of then-outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the amount in the trust account was approximately $300,075,000, or approximately $10.00 per outstanding Class\nA ordinary share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred\nunderwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder\nmust identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business\ncombination with respect to our warrants. Further, we will not proceed with redeeming our public shares, even if a public shareholder\nhas properly elected to redeem its shares, if a business combination does not close. Our sponsor and each member of our management team\nhave entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder\nshares and public shares held by them in connection with (i) the completion of our initial business combination, and (ii) a shareholder\nvote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or\ntiming of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with\nour initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within\n24 months from the closing of our IPO or during any longer period approved by our shareholders as an amendment to our amended and restated\nmemorandum and articles of association (an \u201cExtension Period\u201d) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the\nrights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDistribution of Distributable Redeemable Warrants to Holders\nof Class A Ordinary Shares Not Electing Redemption\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAt the distribution time, we will effect a distribution of a number\nof warrants up to the Aggregate Warrant Amount, as follows: (i) to the extent that no public shareholders redeem their public shares in\nconnection with our initial business combination, each public shareholder will receive one-sixth of one distributable redeemable warrant\nper public share held and (ii) to the extent that any public shareholders redeem any of their public shares in connection with our initial\nbusiness combination, then (A) one-sixth of one distributable redeemable warrant will be distributed to the holder of each non-redeemed\n(or \u201cremaining\u201d) public share and (B) no distributable redeemable warrants will be distributed in respect of any public shares\nthat were redeemed.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPublic shareholders who exercise their redemption rights are not entitled\nto receive any distribution of distributable redeemable warrants in respect of such redeemed public shares. If any such redemptions occur,\nthe distributable redeemable warrants attached to the redeemed public shares will not be redistributed. The contingent right to receive\ndistributable redeemable warrants will remain attached to our Class A ordinary shares, will not be separately transferrable, assignable\nor salable and will not be evidenced by any certificate or instrument.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur distributable redeemable warrants are otherwise identical to our\ndetachable redeemable warrants, including with respect to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. No fractional distributable\nredeemable warrants will be issued, no cash will be paid in lieu of fractional distributable redeemable warrants and only whole warrants\nwill trade. The distributable redeemable warrants will be fungible with our detachable redeemable warrants and will become tradable upon\ntheir distribution under the same stock symbol as the detachable redeemable warrants.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLimitations on Redemptions\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide\nthat in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 either\nprior to or upon consummation of an initial business combination (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC\u2019s \u201cpenny\nstock\u201d rules). However, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners,\n(ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy\nother conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would\nbe required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash\nconditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not\ncomplete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the\nholders thereof.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nManner of Conducting Redemptions\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem\nall or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with\na general meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek\nshareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will\nbe based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek\nshareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer\n(which would require a tender offer rather than seeking shareholder approval under SEC rules). Asset acquisitions and share purchases\nwould not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our Company where we do not survive and any transactions where\nwe issue more than 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles\nof association would typically require shareholder approval. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder\nvote unless shareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to conduct redemptions\npursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities\non Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with Nasdaq rules.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we held a shareholder vote to approve our initial business combination,\nwe will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nconduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nfile proxy materials with the SEC.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business\ncombination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights\ndescribed above upon completion of our initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business\ncombination only if we obtain the approval of an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of a majority\nof the ordinary shares represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon and who vote at a general meeting. In such case,\nour sponsor and each member of our management team have agreed to vote founder shares and public shares of theirs, if any, in favor of\nour initial business combination. As a result, in addition to our initial purchaser\u2019s founder shares, we would need 11,250,000,\nor 37.5% (assuming all issued and outstanding shares are voted), or 1,875,000, or 6.25% (assuming only the minimum number of shares representing\na quorum are voted), of the 30,000,000 public shares sold in our IPO to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order\nto have our initial business combination approved. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether\nthey vote for or against the proposed transaction or vote at all. In addition, our sponsor and each member of our management team have\nentered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares\nand public shares held by them in connection with (i) the completion of a business combination, and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve\nan amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation\nto provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination\nor to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our\nIPO or during any Extension Period or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary\nshares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the\nSEC, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nconduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nfile tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about our initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUpon the public announcement of our initial business combination, if\nwe elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we and our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance\nwith Rule 10b5-1 to purchase Class A ordinary shares in the open market, in order to comply with Rule\u00a014e-5 under the Exchange Act.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules,\nour offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will\nnot be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender\noffer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public\nshareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such initial business\ncombination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLimitation on Redemption upon Completion of Our Initial Business\nCombination If We Seek Shareholder Approval\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination\nand we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended\nand restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder\nor any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup\u201d (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange\nAct), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than 4,500,000 Class A ordinary shares, or an aggregate of 15%\nof the shares sold in our IPO, which we refer to as \u201cExcess Shares,\u201d without our prior consent. We believe this restriction\nwill discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to\nexercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares\nat a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding\nmore than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our IPO could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder\u2019s shares\nare not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By\nlimiting our shareholders\u2019 ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our IPO without our prior consent, we believe\nwe will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business\ncombination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a\nminimum net worth or a certain amount of cash.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, we would not be restricting our shareholders\u2019 ability\nto vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTendering Share Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer\nor Redemption Rights\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPublic shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether\nthey are record holders or hold their shares in \u201cstreet name,\u201d will be required to either tender their certificates (if any)\nto our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, mailed to such holders,\nor to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company\u2019s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At\nCustodian) System, at the holder\u2019s option, in each case up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote to approve\nthe business combination. The proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public\nshares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate the applicable delivery requirements, which will include the\nrequirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public shareholder would\nhave from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior\nto the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to\ntender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption\nrights, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThere is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering\nprocess and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the\ntendering broker a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder.\nHowever, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their\nshares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must\nbe effectuated.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check\ncompanies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute\nproxy materials for the shareholders\u2019 vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed\nbusiness combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After\nthe business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate\nto verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an \u201coption window\u201d after the completion of the business combination\nduring which he or she could monitor the price of the company\u2019s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price,\nhe or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation.\nAs a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the general meeting, would become \u201coption\u201d\nrights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement\nfor physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming shareholder\u2019s election to redeem is irrevocable\nonce the business combination is approved.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAny request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any\ntime up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination, unless otherwise\nagreed to by us. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights\nand subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer\nagent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public\nshares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf our initial business combination is not approved or completed for\nany reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares\nfor the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders\nwho elected to redeem their shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may\ncontinue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until 24 months from the closing of our IPO.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRedemption of Public Shares and Liquidation If No Initial Business\nCombination\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide\nthat we will have only 24 months from the closing of our IPO, until January 14, 2023, to consummate an initial business combination, or\nuntil the end of any Extension Period that may be proposed to and approved by our shareholders in the form of an amendment to our amended\nand restated memorandum and articles of association. If we have not consummated an initial business combination within 24 months from\nthe closing of our IPO or any Extension Period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly\nas reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash,\nequal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and\nnot previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by\nthe number of the then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders\u2019 rights as shareholders\n(including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such\nredemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case\nof clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other\napplicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless\nand no distributable redeemable warrants will have been issued if we fail to consummate an initial business combination within 24 months\nfrom the closing of our IPO. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, if we wind up for any other\nreason prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation\nof the trust account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands\nlaw.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur sponsor and each member of our management team have entered into\nan agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with\nrespect to any founder shares they hold if we fail to consummate an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of\nour IPO or during any Extension Period (although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect\nto any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant\nto a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association\n(A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their\nshares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial\nbusiness combination by January 14, 2023 or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary\nshares, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment\nat a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on\nthe funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any, divided by the number of the then-outstanding\npublic shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001\neither prior to or upon consummation of an initial business combination (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC\u2019s \u201cpenny\nstock\u201d rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we\ncannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares\nat such time. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, any\nexecutive officer, director or any other person.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing\nour plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the proceeds from our IPO\nheld outside the trust account plus up to $100,000 of funds from the trust account available to us to pay dissolution expenses, although\nwe cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our IPO and the sale\nof the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if\nany, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be $10.00. The proceeds\ndeposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the\nclaims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not\nbe less than $10.00. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide\nfor all creditors\u2019 claims.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective\ntarget businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim\nof any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they\nwill execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust\naccount including, but not limited, to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims\nchallenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including\nthe funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the\ntrust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with\na third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third-party\u2019s engagement would be significantly more\nbeneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver\ninclude the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly\nsuperior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider\nwilling to execute a waiver. UBS Securities LLC and RBC Capital Markets, LLC will not execute an agreement with us waiving such claims\nto the monies held in the trust account. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may\nhave in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against\nthe trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable\nto us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us (other than our independent registered\npublic accounting firm), or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the\namounts in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the\ntrust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per public share due to reductions in the value\nof the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, \nprovided \nthat such liability\nwill not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access\nto the trust account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our IPO against certain liabilities, including\nliabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor\nwill not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve\nfor such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity\nobligations and we believe that our sponsor\u2019s only assets are securities of our Company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our\nsponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including,\nwithout limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below\nthe lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the\nliquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case\nnet of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay our income tax obligations, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy\nits indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors\nwould determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect\nthat our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to\nus, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance.\nAccordingly, due to the potential claims of creditors, we cannot assure you that the actual value of the per-share redemption price will\nnot be less than $10.00 per public share.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to\nindemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses\nor other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to\nmonies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our\nIPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We had access to approximately $842,000 as of December\n31, 2021 with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently\nestimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve\nfor claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by\ncreditors. However, any such liability would not be greater than the amount of funds from our trust account received by any such shareholder.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we file a bankruptcy or insolvency petition or an involuntary bankruptcy\nor insolvency petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable\nbankruptcy or insolvency law, and may be included in our bankruptcy or insolvency estate and subject to the claims of third parties with\npriority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy or insolvency claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure\nyou we will be able to return $10.00 per public share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy or insolvency\npetition or an involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by\nshareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy or insolvency laws as either a \u201cpreferential transfer\u201d\nor a \u201cfraudulent conveyance.\u201d As a result, a bankruptcy or insolvency court could seek to recover some or all amounts received\nby our shareholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may\nhave acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our Company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from\nthe trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these\nreasons.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the\ntrust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by January\n14, 2023, (ii) in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify\nthe substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in\nconnection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination\nwithin 24 months from the closing of our IPO or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class\nA ordinary shares, or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of our initial business combination. Public\nshareholders who redeem their Class A ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote described in clause (ii) in the preceding\nsentence shall not be entitled to funds from the trust account upon the subsequent completion of an initial business combination or liquidation\nif we have not consummated an initial business combination by January 14, 2023, with respect to such Class A ordinary shares so redeemed.\nIn no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder\napproval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder\u2019s voting in connection with the business combination\nalone will not result in a shareholder\u2019s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such\nshareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and\narticles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a\nshareholder vote.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCompetition\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our\ninitial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including\nother blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies, and operating businesses seeking strategic\nacquisitions. In particular, since our incorporation a great number of blank check companies have been formed, have completed their initial\npublic offerings and have begun searching for acquisition targets, and many or most of these blank check companies are potential competitors\nof ours in regard to prospective acquisition targets. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying\nand effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical,\nhuman and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses is limited by our available financial resources. This\ninherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash\nin connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial\nbusiness combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by\ncertain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business\ncombination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEmployees\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe currently have two executive officers. These individuals are not\nobligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary\nto our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary\nbased on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process\nwe are in. We are also being provided the services of one or more investment professionals, pursuant to the Services Agreement (as defined\nbelow). We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPeriodic Reporting and Financial Information\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have registered our units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants\nunder the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with\nthe SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported\non by our independent registered public accountants.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the\nprospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, sent to shareholders. These financial\nstatements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the\nhistorical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement\nrequirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements\nin time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within\nthe prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate\nwill have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will\nbe able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements\ncannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates,\nwe do not believe that this limitation will be material.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the\nfiscal year ending December 31, 2021 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Unless we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an\naccelerated filer and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we not be required to comply with the independent registered\npublic accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. A target business may not be in compliance\nwith the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls\nof any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to\nvoluntarily register our securities under Section\u00a012 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations\npromulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under\nthe Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are a Cayman Islands exempted company. Exempted companies are Cayman\nIslands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions\nof the Companies Law. As an exempted company, we have applied for and received a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government\nthat, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Act (2018 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the\ndate of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations\nwill apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in\nthe nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii)\nby way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders\nor a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in Section\n2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various\nreporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but\nnot limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced\ndisclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements\nof holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously\napproved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities\nand the prices of our securities may be more volatile.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \u201cemerging\ngrowth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying\nwith new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting\nstandards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended\ntransition period.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1)\nthe last day of the fiscal year (a)\u00a0following January 14, 2026, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07\nbillion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that\nare held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30\nth\n, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than\n$1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, we are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined\nin Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including,\namong other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last\nday of the fiscal year in which (1) the aggregate worldwide market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds\n$250 million as of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the aggregate\nworldwide market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSummary of Risk Factors\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. The\noccurrence of one or more of the events or circumstances described in the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d alone or in combination\nwith other events or circumstances, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In that event,\nthe trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Such risks include, but are not\nlimited to, the following:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nWe were incorporated in November 2020 and we have no operating history and no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nPast performance by our management team or their respective affiliates may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nOur shareholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed initial business combination, which means we may complete our initial business combination even though a majority of our shareholders do not support such a combination.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nYour only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination may be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your shares from us for cash.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our initial shareholders have agreed to vote in favor of such initial business combination, regardless of how our public shareholders vote.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nThe ability of our public shareholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets, which may make it difficult for us to enter into a business combination with a target.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nThe ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nThe requirement that we consummate an initial business combination within 24 months (or such later date as approved by our shareholders) after the closing of our IPO may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination and may limit the time we have in which to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets, in particular as we approach our dissolution deadline, which could undermine our ability to complete our initial business combination on terms that would produce value for our shareholders.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nOur search for a business combination, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and the status of debt and equity markets.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our initial shareholders, directors, executive officers, advisors and their affiliates may elect to purchase public shares or warrants, which may influence a vote on a proposed business combination and reduce the public \u201cfloat\u201d of our Class A ordinary shares or public warrants.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nIf a shareholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our public shares in connection with our initial business combination, or fails to comply with the procedures for tendering shares, such shares may not be redeemed.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nYou will not have any rights or interests in funds from the trust account, except under certain limited circumstances. Therefore, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nNasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors\u2019 ability to enter into transactions in our securities and subject us and them to additional trading restrictions.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nYou will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of many other blank check companies.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nBecause of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only $10.00 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our detachable redeemable warrants will expire worthless and no distributable redeemable warrants will be issued.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nIf the net proceeds of our IPO and the concurrent sale of private placement warrants not being held in the trust account are insufficient to allow us to operate for the 24 months following the closing of our IPO, it could limit the amount available to fund our search for a target business or businesses and our ability to complete our initial business combination, and we will depend on loans from our sponsor, its affiliates or members of our management team to fund our search and complete our initial business combination.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nRecent increases in inflation in the United States and elsewhere may be leading to increased price volatility for publicly traded securities, including ours, and may lead to other national, regional and international economic disruptions, any of which could make it more difficult for us to consummate a business combination.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nConflict in Ukraine may lead to increased price volatility for publicly traded securities, including ours, and to other national, regional and international economic disruptions, any of which could make it more difficult for us to identify a business combination partner and consummate a business combination on acceptable commercial terms or at all.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "item1a": ">Item\u00a01A. Risk Factors\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk.\nYou should carefully consider all of the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this report, before making\na decision to invest in our securities. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results\nmay be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part\nof your investment.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Relating to our Search for, Consummation\nof, or Inability to Consummate a Business Combination and Post-Business Combination Risks\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur shareholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our\nproposed initial business combination, which means we may complete our initial business combination even though a majority of our shareholders\ndo not support such a combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may choose not to hold a shareholder vote before we complete our\ninitial business combination if the business combination would not require shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange\nlisting requirement. For instance, if we were seeking to acquire a target business where the consideration we were paying in the transaction\nwas all cash, we would typically not be required to seek shareholder approval to complete such a transaction. Except for as required by\napplicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, the decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business\ncombination or will allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and\nwill be based on a variety of factors, such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise\nrequire us to seek shareholder approval. Accordingly, we may complete our initial business combination even if holders of a majority of\nour issued and outstanding ordinary shares do not approve of the business combination we complete.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination,\nour sponsor and members of our management team have agreed to vote in favor of such initial business combination, regardless of how our\npublic shareholders vote.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur sponsor owns, on an as-converted basis, 20% of our outstanding\nordinary shares. Our sponsor and members of our management team also may from time to time purchase Class A ordinary shares prior to our\ninitial business combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, if we seek shareholder approval,\nwe will complete our initial business combination only if we obtain the approval of an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, being\nthe affirmative vote of a majority of the ordinary shares represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon and who vote\nat a general meeting. As a result, in addition to our initial purchaser\u2019s founder shares, we would need 11,250,000, or 37.5% (assuming\nall issued and outstanding shares are voted), or 1,875,000, or 6.25% (assuming only the minimum number of shares representing a quorum\nare voted), of the 30,000,000 public shares sold in our IPO to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our\ninitial business combination approved. Accordingly, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, the agreement\nby our sponsor and each member of our management team to vote in favor of our initial business combination will increase the likelihood\nthat we will receive the requisite shareholder approval for such initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nYour only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding\na potential business combination may be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your shares from us for cash.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAt the time of your investment in us, you will not be provided with\nan opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any target businesses. Since our board of directors may complete a business\ncombination without seeking shareholder approval, public shareholders may not have the right or opportunity to vote on the business combination,\nunless we seek such shareholder approval. Accordingly, your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business\ncombination may be limited to exercising your redemption rights within the period of time (which will be at least 20 business days) set\nforth in our tender offer documents mailed to our public shareholders in which we describe our initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe ability of our public shareholders to redeem their shares for\ncash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets, which may make it difficult for us to enter\ninto a business combination with a target.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may seek to enter into a business combination transaction agreement\nwith a prospective target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many\npublic shareholders exercise their redemption rights, we would not be able to meet such closing condition and, as a result, would not\nbe able to proceed with the business combination. Furthermore, in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause\nour net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 either prior to or upon consummation of an initial business combination (so that we\ndo not then become subject to the SEC\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\n\u201d\n rules). Consequently, if accepting all properly submitted\nredemption requests would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 either prior to or upon consummation of an initial\nbusiness combination or such greater amount necessary to satisfy a closing condition as described above, we would not proceed with such\nredemption and the related business combination and may instead search for an alternate business combination. Prospective targets will\nbe aware of these risks and, thus, may be reluctant to enter into a business combination transaction with us.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights\nwith respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital\nstructure.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAt the time we enter into an agreement for our initial business combination,\nwe will not know how many shareholders may exercise their redemption rights, and therefore will need to structure the transaction based\non our expectations as to the number of shares that will be submitted for redemption. If a large number of shares are submitted for redemption,\nwe may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the trust account or arrange for additional third-party\nfinancing. Raising additional third-party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher\nthan desirable levels. The above considerations may limit our ability to complete the most desirable business combination available to\nus or optimize our capital structure. The amount of the deferred underwriting commissions payable to the underwriters will not be adjusted\nfor any shares that are redeemed in connection with an initial business combination. The per-share amount we will distribute to shareholders\nwho properly exercise their redemption rights will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions and after such redemptions,\nthe amount held in trust will continue to reflect our obligation to pay the entire deferred underwriting commissions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights\nwith respect to a large number of our shares could increase the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful\nand that you would have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem your shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a\nportion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, the probability\nthat our initial business combination would be unsuccessful is increased. If our initial business combination is unsuccessful, you would\nnot receive your pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account until we liquidate the trust account. If you are in need of immediate\nliquidity, you could attempt to sell your shares in the open market; however, at such time our shares may trade at a discount to the pro\nrata amount per share in the trust account. In either situation, you may suffer a material loss on your investment or lose the benefit\nof funds expected in connection with our redemption until we liquidate or you are able to sell your shares in the open market.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe requirement that we consummate an initial business combination\nwithin 24 months after the closing of our IPO may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination\nand may limit the time we have in which to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets, in particular as we approach\nour dissolution deadline, which could undermine our ability to complete our initial business combination on terms that would produce value\nfor our shareholders.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAny potential target business with which we enter into negotiations\nconcerning a business combination will be aware that we must consummate an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing\nof our IPO. Consequently, such target business may obtain leverage over us in negotiating a business combination, knowing that if we do\nnot complete our initial business combination with that particular target business, we may be unable to complete our initial business\ncombination with any target business. This risk will increase as we get closer to the time frame described above. In addition, we may\nhave limited time to conduct due diligence and may enter into our initial business combination on terms that we would have rejected upon\na more comprehensive investigation.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nOur working capital position and the requirement that we consummate\nan initial business combination within 24 months after the closing of our IPO give rise to substantial doubt about our ability to continue\nas a going concern.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we had approximately $842,000 in cash and approximately\n$1,783,000 in negative working capital. We have incurred and we expect to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of a business\ncombination. Further, we have until January 14, 2023 to consummate a business combination, and it is uncertain that we will be able to\nconsummate a business combination by that date. If a business combination is not consummated by that date, we will commence a mandatory\nliquidation and subsequent dissolution. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for\na period of time within one year after the date of our financial statements included in this report. Our financial statements do not include\nany adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs the number of special purpose acquisition companies evaluating\ntargets increases, attractive targets may become scarcer and there may be more competition for attractive targets. This could increase\nthe cost of our initial business combination and could even result in our inability to find a target or to consummate an initial business\ncombination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn recent years, the number of special purpose acquisition companies\nthat have been formed has increased substantially. Many potential targets for special purpose acquisition companies have already entered\ninto an initial business combination, and there are still many special purpose acquisition companies seeking targets for their initial\nbusiness combination, as well as many such companies currently in registration. As a result, at times, fewer attractive targets may be\navailable, and it may require more time, more effort and more resources to identify a suitable target and to consummate an initial business\ncombination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, because there are more special purpose acquisition companies\nseeking to enter into an initial business combination with available targets, the competition for available targets with attractive fundamentals\nor business models may increase, which could cause targets companies to demand improved financial terms. Attractive deals could also become\nscarcer for other reasons, such as economic or industry sector downturns, geopolitical tensions, or increases in the cost of additional\ncapital needed to close business combinations or operate targets post-business combination. This could increase the cost of, delay or\notherwise complicate or frustrate our ability to find and consummate an initial business combination, and may result in our inability\nto consummate an initial business combination on terms favorable to our investors altogether. If we are unable to consummate an initial\nbusiness combination, our public shareholders may receive only $10.00 per public share, or less than $10.00 per public share, on the redemption\nof their shares, our detachable redeemable warrants will expire worthless and no distributable redeemable warrants will have been distributed.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may engage one or more of the underwriters of our IPO or one\nof their respective affiliates to provide additional services to us after the IPO, which may include acting as a financial advisor in\nconnection with an initial business combination or as placement agent in connection with a related financing transaction. Our underwriters\nare entitled to receive deferred underwriting commissions that will be released from the trust account only upon a completion of an initial\nbusiness combination. This may cause them to have potential conflicts of interest in rendering any additional services to us, including,\nfor example, in connection with the sourcing and consummation of an initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may engage one or more of our IPO underwriters or one of their respective\naffiliates to provide additional services to us after the IPO, including, for example, identifying potential targets, providing financial\nadvisory services, acting as a placement agent in a private offering or arranging debt financing transactions. We may pay such underwriters\nor affiliates fair and reasonable fees or other compensation that would be determined at that time in an arm\u2019s-length negotiation.\nThe underwriters are also entitled to receive deferred underwriting commissions conditioned on the completion of an initial business combination.\nThe underwriters\u2019, or their respective affiliates\u2019, financial interests tied to the consummation of a business combination\ntransaction may give rise to potential conflicts of interest in their provision of any additional services to us, including potential\nconflicts of interest in connection with the sourcing and consummation of an initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur search for a business combination, and any target business with\nwhich we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected by the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak\nand the status of debt and equity markets.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn December\u00a02019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to\nhave surfaced, which has and is continuing to spread throughout the world, including the United\u00a0States. On January\u00a030, 2020,\nthe World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a \u201cPublic Health Emergency of International\nConcern.\n\u201d\n On January\u00a031, 2020, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency\nfor the United\u00a0States to aid the U.S. healthcare community in responding to COVID-19, and on March\u00a011, 2020 the World Health\nOrganization characterized the outbreak as a \u201cpandemic.\n\u201d\n The pandemic, together with resulting voluntary and U.S. federal\nand state and non-U.S. governmental actions, including, without limitation, mandatory business closures, public gathering limitations,\nrestrictions on travel and quarantines, has meaningfully disrupted the global economy and markets. Although the long-term economic fallout\nof COVID-19 is difficult to predict, it has and is expected to continue to have ongoing material adverse effects across many, if not all,\naspects of the regional, national and global economy. The COVID-19 outbreak has and a significant outbreak of other infectious diseases\ncould result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets worldwide, and the business\nof any potential target business with which we consummate a business combination could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore,\nwe may be unable to complete a business combination if continued concerns relating to COVID-19 continues to restrict travel, limit the\nability to have meetings with potential investors or the target company\u2019s personnel, vendors and services providers are unavailable\nto negotiate and consummate a transaction in a timely manner. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our search for a business combination\nwill depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning\nthe severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. If the disruptions posed by COVID-19 or\nother matters of global concern continue for an extensive period of time, our ability to consummate a business combination, or the operations\nof a target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, our ability to consummate a transaction may be dependent\non the ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted by COVID-19 and other events, including as a result of increased\nmarket volatility, decreased market liquidity in third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may not be able to consummate an initial business combination\nwithin 24 months after the closing of our IPO, or before the end of any Extension Period that may be proposed to and approved by our shareholders\nin the form of an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, in which case we would cease all operations\nexcept for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our public shares and liquidate, in which case our public shareholders may receive\nonly $10.00 per share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, and our detachable redeemable warrants will expire worthless,\nand our distributable redeemable warrants will never have been distributed.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may not be able to find a suitable target business and consummate\nan initial business combination within 24 months after the closing of our IPO, or until the end of any Extension Period that may be proposed\nto and approved by our shareholders in the form of an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. Our\nability to complete our initial business combination may be negatively impacted by general market conditions, volatility in the capital\nand debt markets and the other risks described herein. For example, the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to grow both in the U.S. and globally\nand, while the extent of the impact of the outbreak on us will depend on future developments, it could limit our ability to complete our\ninitial business combination, including as a result of increased market volatility, decreased market liquidity and third-party financing\nbeing unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all. Additionally, the outbreak of COVID-19 may negatively impact businesses we may\nseek to acquire. If we have not consummated an initial business combination within such applicable time period, we will: (i)\u00a0cease\nall operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii)\u00a0as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days\nthereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust\naccount, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if\nany (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares, which\nredemption will completely extinguish public shareholders\u2019 rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation\ndistributions, if any); and (iii)\u00a0as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining\nshareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii)\u00a0and (iii), to our obligations\nunder Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Our amended and restated memorandum\nand articles of association provide that, if we wind up for any other reason prior to the consummation of our initial business combination,\nwe will follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation of the trust account as promptly as reasonably possible but not\nmore than ten business days thereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands law. In either such case, our public shareholders may receive\nonly $10.00 per public share, or less than $10.00 per public share, on the redemption of their shares, our detachable redeemable warrants\nwill expire worthless and no distributable redeemable warrants will have been distributed.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we have not consummated an initial business combination within\n24 months from the closing of our IPO, our public shareholders may be forced to wait beyond such 24 months before redemption from our\ntrust account.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we have not consummated an initial business combination within 24\nmonths from the closing of our IPO, the proceeds then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in\nthe trust account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution\nexpenses), will be used to fund the redemption of our public shares, as further described herein. Any redemption of public shareholders\nfrom the trust account will be effected automatically by function of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association prior\nto any voluntary winding up. If we are required to wind up, liquidate the trust account and distribute such amount therein, pro rata,\nto our public shareholders, as part of any liquidation process, such winding up, liquidation and distribution must comply with the applicable\nprovisions of the Companies Law. In that case, investors may be forced to wait beyond 24 months from the closing of our IPO before the\nredemption proceeds of our trust account become available to them, and they receive the return of their pro rata portion of the proceeds\nfrom our trust account. We have no obligation to return funds to investors prior to the date of our redemption or liquidation unless,\nprior thereto, we consummate our initial business combination or amend certain provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles\nof association, and only then in cases where investors have sought to redeem their Class A ordinary shares. Only upon our redemption or\nany liquidation will public shareholders be entitled to distributions if we do not complete our initial business combination and do not\namend certain provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles\nof association provide that, if we wind up for any other reason prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will\nfollow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation of the trust account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than\nten business days thereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands law.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination,\nour sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors and their affiliates may elect to purchase public shares or warrants, which may influence\na vote on a proposed business combination and reduce the public \u201cfloat\u201d of our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares or public warrants.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination\nand we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor,\ndirectors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or detachable redeemable warrants or a combination\nthereof in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business\ncombination, although they are under no obligation to do so. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage\nin such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account\nwill be used to purchase public shares or warrants in such transactions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the event that our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors\nor their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise\ntheir redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. The purpose\nof any such transaction could be to (1)\u00a0vote in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining\nshareholder approval of the business combination, (2)\u00a0reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or vote such warrants on any\nmatters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination or (3)\u00a0satisfy a closing\ncondition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our\ninitial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. Any such purchases of our securities\nmay result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases\nare made, the public \u201cfloat\n\u201d\n of our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares or public warrants may be reduced and the number of\nbeneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading\nof our securities on a national securities exchange. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section\u00a013 and Section\u00a016\nof the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf a shareholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem\nour public shares in connection with our initial business combination, or fails to comply with the procedures for tendering its shares,\nsuch shares may not be redeemed.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe will comply with the proxy rules or tender offer rules, as applicable,\nwhen conducting redemptions in connection with our initial business combination. Despite our compliance with these rules, if a shareholder\nfails to receive our proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, such shareholder may not become aware of the opportunity\nto redeem its shares. In addition, the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of\nour public shares in connection with our initial business combination will describe the various procedures that must be complied with\nin order to validly redeem or tender public shares. In the event that a shareholder fails to comply with these procedures, its shares\nmay not be redeemed.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nYou will not have any rights or interests in funds from the trust\naccount, except under certain limited circumstances. Therefore, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares\nor warrants, potentially at a loss.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the\ntrust account only upon the earliest to occur of: (i)\u00a0our completion of an initial business combination, and then only in connection\nwith those Class\u00a0A ordinary shares that such shareholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described herein,\n(ii)\u00a0the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated\nmemorandum and articles of association (A)\u00a0to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class\u00a0A\nordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public\nshares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO or (B)\u00a0with respect to\nany other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares, and (iii)\u00a0the redemption of our public\nshares if we have not consummated an initial business within 24 months from the closing of our IPO, subject to applicable law and as further\ndescribed herein. Public shareholders who redeem their Class\u00a0A ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote described in\nclause (ii)\u00a0in the preceding sentence shall not be entitled to funds from the trust account upon the subsequent completion of an\ninitial business combination or liquidation if we have not consummated an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing\nof our IPO, with respect to such Class\u00a0A ordinary shares so redeemed. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder have any\nright or interest of any kind in the trust account. Holders of warrants will not have any right to the proceeds held in the trust account\nwith respect to the warrants. Accordingly, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially\nat a loss.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles\nof association that relate to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares (and corresponding provisions of the agreement governing\nthe release of funds from our trust account) may be amended with the approval of a special resolution which requires the approval of the\nholders of at least two-thirds of our ordinary shares who attend and vote at a general meeting of the Company, which is a lower amendment\nthreshold than that of some other blank check companies. It may be easier for us, therefore, to amend our amended and restated memorandum\nand articles of association to facilitate the completion of an initial business combination that some of our shareholders may not support.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSome other blank check companies have a provision in their charter\nwhich prohibits the amendment of certain of its provisions, including those which relate to the rights of a company\u2019s shareholders,\nwithout approval by a certain percentage of the company\u2019s shareholders. In those companies, amendment of these provisions typically\nrequires approval by between 90% and 100% of the company\u2019s shareholders. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association\nprovide that any of its provisions related to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares (including the requirement to deposit\nproceeds of our IPO and the private placement of warrants into the trust account and not release such amounts except in specified circumstances,\nand to provide redemption rights to public shareholders as described herein) may be amended if approved by special resolution, meaning\nholders of at least two-thirds of our ordinary shares who attend and vote at a general meeting of the Company, and corresponding provisions\nof the trust agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account may be amended if approved by holders of at least 65% of\nour ordinary shares; provided that the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association governing the appointment\nor removal of directors prior to our initial business combination may only be amended by a special resolution passed by not less than\ntwo-thirds of our ordinary shares who attend and vote at our general meeting which shall include the affirmative vote of a simple majority\nof our Class B ordinary shares. Our sponsor and its permitted transferees, if any, who will collectively beneficially own, on an as-converted\nbasis, 20% of our Class A ordinary shares upon the closing of our IPO (assuming they do not purchase any units in our IPO), will participate\nin any vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and/or trust agreement and will have the discretion\nto vote in any manner they choose. As a result, we may be able to amend the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles\nof association which govern our pre-business combination behavior more easily than some other blank check companies, and this may increase\nour ability to complete a business combination with which you do not agree. Our shareholders may pursue remedies against us for any breach\nof our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant\nto agreements with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A)\nthat would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their\nshares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial\nbusiness combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of\nholders of our Class A ordinary shares, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary\nshares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the\ntrust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes,\nif any, divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares. Our shareholders are not parties to, or third-party beneficiaries\nof, these agreements and, as a result, will not have the ability to pursue remedies against our sponsor, executive officers or directors\nfor any breach of these agreements. As a result, in the event of a breach, our shareholders would need to pursue a shareholder derivative\naction, subject to applicable law.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may amend the terms of the contingent rights in a way that may\nbe adverse to holders with the consent or vote of the holders of not less than two-thirds of the then outstanding contingent rights, as\nevidenced by their ownership of the ordinary shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur contingent rights have been issued under a contingent rights agreement\nbetween Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as rights agent, and us. The contingent rights agreement provides that the terms\nof the contingent rights may be amended without the consent of any holder for the purpose of curing any ambiguity, or of curing, correcting\nor supplementing any defective provision contained therein or adding or changing any other provision with respect to matters or questions\narising under the contingent rights agreement as the parties may deem necessary or desirable. The contingent rights agreement requires\nthe consent or vote of the holders of not less than two-thirds of the then outstanding contingent rights, as evidenced by their ownership\nof the ordinary shares, in order to make any change that will adversely affect the interests of the holders of the contingent rights.\nAs a result, a change that is approved by two-third of the holders of the contingent rights, as evidenced by their ownership of the ordinary\nshares, could adversely affect your contingent rights, without your approval.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may be unable to obtain additional financing to complete our\ninitial business combination or to fund the operations and growth of a target business, which could compel us to restructure or abandon\na particular business combination. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public\nshareholders may receive only $10.00 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our\ndetachable redeemable warrants will expire worthless and no distributable redeemable warrants will have been issued.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough we believe that the net proceeds of our IPO and the sale of\nthe private placement warrants will be sufficient to allow us to complete our initial business combination, because we have not yet selected\nany prospective target business we cannot ascertain the capital requirements for any particular transaction. If the net proceeds of our\nIPO and the sale of the private placement warrants prove to be insufficient, either because of the size of our initial business combination,\nthe depletion of the available net proceeds in search of a target business, the obligation to redeem for cash a significant number of\nshares from shareholders who elect redemption in connection with our initial business combination or the terms of negotiated transactions\nto purchase shares in connection with our initial business combination, we may be required to seek additional financing or to abandon\nthe proposed business combination. We cannot assure you that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. The current\neconomic environment may make it difficult for companies to obtain acquisition financing. To the extent that additional financing proves\nto be unavailable when needed to complete our initial business combination, we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction\nor abandon that particular business combination and seek an alternative target business candidate. If we have not consummated our initial\nbusiness combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only $10.00 per public share, or less in certain\ncircumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our detachable redeemable warrants will expire worthless and no distributable\nredeemable warrants will have been issued. In addition, even if we do not need additional financing to complete our initial business combination,\nwe may require such financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing could\nhave a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business. None of our officers, directors or shareholders\nis required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nYou will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors\nof many other blank check companies.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSince the net proceeds of our IPO and the sale of the private placement\nwarrants are intended to be used to complete an initial business combination with a target business that has not been selected, we may\nbe deemed to be a \u201cblank check\n\u201d\n company under the United\u00a0States securities laws. However, because we will have\nnet tangible assets in excess of $5,000,000 upon the completion of our IPO and the sale of the private placement warrants and have filed\na current report on Form\u00a08-K, including an audited balance sheet demonstrating this fact, we are exempt from rules promulgated by\nthe SEC to protect investors in blank check companies, such as Rule\u00a0419. Accordingly, investors will not be afforded the benefits\nor protections of those rules. Among other things, this means our units will be immediately tradable and we will have a longer period\nof time to complete our initial business combination than do companies subject to Rule\u00a0419. Moreover, if our IPO had been subject\nto Rule\u00a0419, that rule would prohibit the release of any interest earned on funds held in the trust account to us unless and until\nthe funds in the trust account were released to us in connection with our completion of an initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nBecause of our limited resources and the significant competition\nfor business combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. If we have not consummated\nour initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only $10.00 per public share, or\nless in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account, our detachable redeemable warrants will expire worthless and no\ndistributable redeemable warrants will have been issued.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having\na business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check\ncompanies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals\nand entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of\ncompanies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other\nresources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those\nof many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds\nof our IPO and the sale of the private placement warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses\nthat are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage\nin pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, we are obligated to offer holders of our public shares the right\nto redeem their shares for cash at the time of our initial business combination in conjunction with a shareholder vote or via a tender\noffer. Target companies will be aware that this may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination. Any of\nthese obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. If we have not consummated\nour initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only $10.00 per public share, or\nless in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account, our detachable redeemable warrants will expire worthless and no\ndistributable redeemable warrants will have been issued.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf the net proceeds of our IPO and the sale of the private placement\nwarrants not being held in the trust account are insufficient to allow us to operate for the 24 months following the closing of our IPO,\nit could limit the amount available to fund our search for a target business or businesses and our ability to complete our initial business\ncombination, and we will depend on loans from our sponsor, its affiliates or members of our management team to fund our search and to\ncomplete our initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOf the net proceeds of our IPO and the sale of the private placement\nwarrants, over $1,350,000 will be available to us initially outside the trust account to fund our working capital requirements. We believe\nthat, upon the closing of our IPO, the funds available to us outside of the trust account, together with funds available from loans from\nour sponsor, its affiliates or members of our management team will be sufficient to allow us to operate for at least the 24 months following\nthe closing of our IPO; however, we cannot assure you that our estimate is accurate, and our sponsor, its affiliates or members of our\nmanagement team are under no obligation to advance funds to us in such circumstances. Of the funds available to us, we expect to use a\nportion of the funds available to us to pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business. We could also use\na portion of the funds as a down payment or to fund a \u201cno-shop\n\u201d \nprovision (a provision in letters of intent designed\nto keep target businesses from \u201cshopping\n\u201d\n around for transactions with other companies or investors on terms more favorable\nto such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to\ndo so. If we entered into a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business and were subsequently\nrequired to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise), we might not have sufficient funds to continue searching\nfor, or conduct due diligence with respect to, a target business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we are required to seek additional capital, we would need to borrow\nfunds from our sponsor, its affiliates, members of our management team or other third parties to operate or may be forced to liquidate.\nNeither our sponsor, members of our management team nor their affiliates is under any obligation to us in such circumstances. Any such\nadvances may be repaid only from funds held outside the trust account or from funds released to us upon completion of our initial business\ncombination. Up to $2,000,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-business combination entity at a price of $1.50\nper warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. Prior to the completion of\nour initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor, its affiliates or members of our\nmanagement team as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights\nto seek access to funds in our trust account. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period\nbecause we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. Consequently,\nour public shareholders may only receive $10.00 per public share, or possibly less, on our redemption of our public shares, our detachable\nredeemable warrants will expire worthless and no distributable redeemable warrants will have been issued.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may have a limited ability to assess the management of a prospective\ntarget business and, as a result, may affect our initial business combination with a target business whose management may not have the\nskills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhen evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business\ncombination with a prospective target business, our ability to assess the target business\u2019s management may be limited due to a lack\nof time, resources or information. Our assessment of the capabilities of the target business\u2019s management, therefore, may prove\nto be incorrect and such management may lack the skills, qualifications or abilities we suspected. Should the target business\u2019s\nmanagement not possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to manage a public company, the operations and profitability\nof the post-combination business may be negatively impacted. Accordingly, any holders who choose to retain their securities following\nthe business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such\nreduction in value.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe officers and directors of an acquisition candidate may resign\nupon completion of our initial business combination. The loss of a business combination target\u2019s key personnel could negatively\nimpact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe role of an acquisition candidate\u2019s key personnel upon the\ncompletion of our initial business combination cannot be ascertained at this time. Although we contemplate that certain members of an\nacquisition candidate\u2019s management team will remain associated with the acquisition candidate following our initial business combination,\nit is possible that members of the management of an acquisition candidate will not wish to remain in place.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA provision of our warrant agreement may make it more difficult\nfor us to consummate an initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnlike most blank check companies, if (i) we issue additional Class\nA ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of our initial business combination\nat a Newly Issued Price of less than $9.20 per ordinary share, (ii) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than\n60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of our initial business combination on the date of the\nconsummation of our initial business combination (net of redemptions), and (iii) the Market Value is below $9.20 per share, then the exercise\nprice of the warrants will be adjusted to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the $18.00\nper share redemption trigger prices described in the prospectus for our IPO under \u201cDescription of Securities\u2014Warrants\u2014Public\nShareholders\u2019 Warrants\u2014Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $18.00\u201d and\n\u201cRedemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $10.00\u201d will be adjusted (to the nearest\ncent) to be equal to 180% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the $10.00 per share redemption trigger price\ndescribed in the prospectus for our IPO under \u201cDescription of Securities\u2014Warrants\u2014Public Shareholders\u2019 Warrants\u2014Redemption\nof warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $10.00\u201d will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal\nto the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price. This may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business\ncombination with a target business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSubsequent to our completion of our initial business combination,\nwe may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative\neffect on our financial condition, results of operations and the price of our securities, which could cause you to lose some or all of\nyour investment.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEven if we conduct due diligence on a target business with which we\ncombine, we cannot assure you that this diligence will identify all material issues with a particular target business, that it would be\npossible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of the target business and\noutside of our control will not later arise. As a result of these factors, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure\nour operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses. Even if our due diligence successfully\nidentifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary\nrisk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report\ncharges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature\nmay cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming pre-existing debt held by a target\nbusiness or by virtue of our obtaining post-combination debt financing. Accordingly, any holders who choose to retain their securities\nfollowing the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such holders are unlikely to have a remedy\nfor such reduction in value.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may issue notes or other debt securities, or otherwise incur\nsubstantial debt, to complete a business combination, which may adversely affect our leverage and financial condition and thus negatively\nimpact the value of our shareholders\u2019 investment in us.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough we have no commitments as of the date of this report to issue\nany notes or other debt securities, or to otherwise incur outstanding debt following our IPO, we may choose to incur substantial debt\nto complete our initial business combination. We and our officers have agreed that we will not incur any indebtedness unless we have obtained\nfrom the lender a waiver of any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to the monies held in the trust account. As such, no\nissuance of debt will affect the per-share amount available for redemption from the trust account. Nevertheless, the incurrence of debt\ncould have a variety of negative effects, including:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\ndefault and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nacceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nour immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt is payable on demand;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nour inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt is outstanding;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nour inability to pay dividends on our Class A ordinary shares;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nusing a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our Class A ordinary shares if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nlimitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nincreased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nlimitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may only be able to complete one business combination with the\nproceeds of our IPO and the sale of the private placement warrants, which will cause us to be solely dependent on a single business which\nmay have a limited number of products or services. This lack of diversification may negatively impact our operations and profitability.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe proceeds from our IPO and the sale of the private placement warrants,\nafter deducting underwriting commissions and estimated offering expenses, will provide us with up to $290,850,000 that we may use to complete\nour initial business combination (after taking into account the $10,500,000 of deferred underwriting commissions being held in the trust\naccount and the estimated expenses of our IPO).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may effectuate our initial business combination with a single-target\nbusiness or multiple-target businesses simultaneously or within a short period of time. However, we may not be able to effectuate our\ninitial business combination with more than one target business because of various factors, including the existence of complex accounting\nissues and the requirement that we prepare and file pro forma financial statements with the SEC that present operating results and the\nfinancial condition of several target businesses as if they had been operated on a combined basis. By completing our initial business\ncombination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments.\nFurther, we would not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike\nother entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries or different areas of a\nsingle industry.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAccordingly, the prospects for our success may be:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nsolely dependent upon the performance of a single business, property or asset; or\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\ndependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive\nand regulatory risks, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent\nto our initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may attempt to simultaneously complete business combinations\nwith multiple prospective targets, which may hinder our ability to complete our initial business combination and give rise to increased\ncosts and risks that could negatively impact our operations and profitability.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses that are\nowned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous\nclosings of the other business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete our initial business\ncombination. With multiple business combinations, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect\nto possible multiple negotiations and due diligence (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent\nassimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business. If we are unable to\nadequately address these risks, it could negatively impact our profitability and results of operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n32\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may attempt to complete our initial business combination with\na private company about which little information is available, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as\nprofitable as we suspected, if at all.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn pursuing our acquisition strategy, we may seek to effectuate our\ninitial business combination with a privately held company. Very little public information generally exists about private companies, and\nwe could be required to make our decision on whether to pursue a potential initial business combination on the basis of limited information,\nwhich may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBecause we must furnish our shareholders with target business financial\nstatements, we may lose the ability to complete an otherwise advantageous initial business combination with some prospective target businesses.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe federal proxy rules require that a proxy statement with respect\nto a vote on a business combination meeting certain financial significance tests include historical and/or pro forma financial statement\ndisclosure in periodic reports. We will include the same financial statement disclosure in connection with our tender offer documents,\nwhether or not they are required under the tender offer rules. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance\nwith, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, or international financial\nreporting standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical\nfinancial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates), or PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some\ntargets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and\ncomplete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur management may not be able to maintain control of a target business\nafter our initial business combination. Upon the loss of control of a target business, new management may not possess the skills, qualifications\nor abilities necessary to profitably operate such business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may structure our initial business combination so that the post-business\ncombination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target\nbusiness, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of\nthe outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for us\nnot to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We will not consider any transaction that does\nnot meet such criteria. Even if the post-business combination company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders\nprior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending\non valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue\na substantial number of new Class A ordinary shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests\nof a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number\nof new Class A ordinary shares, our shareholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than a majority of our outstanding\nClass A ordinary shares subsequent to such transaction. In addition, other minority shareholders may subsequently combine their holdings\nresulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the company\u2019s shares than we initially acquired. Accordingly,\nthis may make it more likely that our management will not be able to maintain control of the target business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may seek business combination opportunities with a high degree\nof complexity that require significant operational improvements, which could delay or prevent us from achieving our desired results.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may seek business combination opportunities with large, highly complex\ncompanies that we believe would benefit from operational improvements. While we intend to implement such improvements, to the extent that\nour efforts are delayed or we are unable to achieve the desired improvements, the business combination may not be as successful as we\nanticipate.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n33\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo the extent we complete our initial business combination with a large\ncomplex business or entity with a complex operating structure, we may also be affected by numerous risks inherent in the operations of\nthe business with which we combine, which could delay or prevent us from implementing our strategy. Although our management team will\nendeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business and its operations, we may not be able to properly ascertain or\nassess all of the significant risk factors until we complete our business combination. If we are not able to achieve our desired operational\nimprovements, or the improvements take longer to implement than anticipated, we may not achieve the gains that we anticipate. Furthermore,\nsome of these risks and complexities may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that\nthose risks and complexities will adversely impact a target business. Such combination may not be as successful as a combination with\na smaller, less complex organization.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe do not have a specified maximum redemption threshold. The absence\nof such a redemption threshold may make it possible for us to complete our initial business combination with which a substantial majority\nof our shareholders do not agree.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association do\nnot provide a specified maximum redemption threshold, except that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would\ncause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 either prior to or upon consummation of an initial business combination (so that\nwe do not then become subject to the SEC\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules). As a result, we may be able to complete our initial\nbusiness combination even though a substantial majority of our public shareholders do not agree with the transaction and have redeemed\ntheir shares or, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and do not conduct redemptions in connection with\nour initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, have entered into privately negotiated agreements to sell their shares\nto our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required\nto pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant\nto the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business\ncombination or redeem any shares, all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we\ninstead may search for an alternate business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn order to effectuate an initial business combination, blank check\ncompanies have, in the recent past, amended various provisions of their charters and other governing instruments, including their warrant\nagreements. We cannot assure you that we will not seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or governing\ninstruments in a manner that will make it easier for us to complete our initial business combination that our shareholders may not support.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn order to effectuate a business combination, blank check companies\nhave, in the recent past, amended various provisions of their charters and governing instruments, including their warrant agreements.\nFor example, blank check companies have amended the definition of business combination, increased redemption thresholds, extended the\ntime to consummate an initial business combination and, with respect to their warrants, amended their warrant agreements to require the\nwarrants to be exchanged for cash and/or other securities. Amending our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association requires\nat least a special resolution of our shareholders as a matter of Cayman Islands law, meaning the approval of holders of at least two-thirds\nof our ordinary shares who attend and vote at a general meeting of the Company, and amending our warrant agreement will require a vote\nof holders of at least 50% of the public warrants. In addition solely with respect to any amendment to the terms of the private placement\nwarrants or any provision of the warrant agreement with respect to the private placement warrants, a vote of holders of 50% of the number\nof the then outstanding private placement warrants is required. In addition, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association\nrequire us to provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares for cash if we propose an amendment to\nour amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide\nholders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or\nto redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO\nor (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares. To the extent any of such\namendments would be deemed to fundamentally change the nature of any of our outstanding public securities, we would register, or seek\nan exemption from registration for, the affected securities.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the\ntrust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.00 per public share.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur placing of funds in the trust account may not protect those funds\nfrom third-party claims against us. Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other\nentities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies\nheld in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, such parties may not execute such agreements, or even if they execute\nsuch agreements, they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement,\nbreach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case\nin order to gain advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third-party\nrefuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of\nthe alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third-party that has not executed a waiver if management\nbelieves that such third-party\u2019s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nExamples of possible instances where we may engage a third-party that\nrefuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management\nto be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable\nto find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any\nclaims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek\nrecourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we have not consummated an initial business\ncombination within 24\u00a0months from the closing of our IPO, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial\nbusiness combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against\nus within the ten years following redemption. Accordingly, the per-share redemption amount received by public shareholders could be less\nthan the $10.00 per public share initially held in the trust account, due to claims of such creditors. Pursuant to the letter agreement\nthe form of which is filed as an exhibit to this report, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any\nclaims by a third-party (other than our independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to us, or\na prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account\nto below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii)\u00a0the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the\ndate of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets,\nin each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations,\u00a0\nprovided\u00a0\nthat such liability will\nnot apply to any claims by a third-party or prospective target business that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to\nthe trust account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our IPO against certain liabilities, including\nliabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third-party,\nour sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification\nobligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe\nthat our sponsor\u2019s only assets are securities of our Company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to\nsatisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our\ninitial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able\nto complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of\nyour public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims\nby vendors and prospective target businesses.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations\nof our sponsor, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public shareholders.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below\nthe lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the\nliquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case\nnet of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its obligations\nor that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take\nlegal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors\nwould take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent\ndirectors in exercising their business judgment and subject to their fiduciary duties may choose not to do so in any particular instance.\nIf our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount of funds in the trust account available\nfor distribution to our public shareholders may be reduced below $10.00 per public share.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n35\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may not have sufficient funds to satisfy indemnification claims\nof our directors and executive officers.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have agreed to indemnify our officers and directors to the fullest\nextent permitted by law. However, our officers and directors have agreed to waive any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or\nto any monies in the trust account and to not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason whatsoever (except to the extent\nthey are entitled to funds from the trust account due to their ownership of public shares). Accordingly, any indemnification provided\nwill be able to be satisfied by us only if (i) we have sufficient funds outside of the trust account or (ii) we consummate an initial\nbusiness combination. Our obligation to indemnify our officers and directors may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against\nour officers or directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of\nderivative litigation against our officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our\nshareholders. Furthermore, a shareholder\u2019s investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and\ndamage awards against our officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our\npublic shareholders, we file a bankruptcy or insolvency petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency petition is filed against\nus that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy or insolvency court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the members of our board of directors\nmay be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby exposing the members of our board of directors and us\nto claims of punitive damages.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public\nshareholders, we file a bankruptcy or insolvency petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency petition is filed against us that\nis not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy or insolvency\nlaws as either a \u201cpreferential transfer\u201d or a \u201cfraudulent conveyance.\u201d As a result, a bankruptcy or insolvency\ncourt could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. In addition, our board of directors may be viewed as having\nbreached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages,\nby paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to our\npublic shareholders, we file a bankruptcy or insolvency petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency petition is filed against\nus that is not dismissed, the claims of creditors in such proceeding may have priority over the claims of our shareholders and the per-share\namount that would otherwise be received by our shareholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to our public\nshareholders, we file a bankruptcy or insolvency petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency petition is filed against us that\nis not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law, and may be included\nin our bankruptcy or insolvency estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To\nthe extent any bankruptcy or insolvency claims deplete the trust account, the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our\nshareholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur shareholders may be held liable for claims by third parties\nagainst us to the extent of distributions received by them upon redemption of their shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we are forced to enter into an insolvent liquidation, any distributions\nreceived by shareholders could be viewed as an unlawful payment if it was proved that immediately following the date on which the distribution\nwas made, we were unable to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. As a result, a liquidator could seek to\nrecover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary\nduties to us or our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing themselves and our Company to claims, by paying public\nshareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought\nagainst us for these reasons. We and our directors and officers who knowingly and willfully authorized or permitted any distribution to\nbe paid out of our share premium account while we were unable to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business would\nbe guilty of an offence and may be liable for a fine of $18,292.68 and imprisonment for five years in the Cayman Islands.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n36\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may not hold an annual general meeting until after the consummation\nof our initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn accordance with Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, we are\nnot required to hold an annual general meeting until one year after our first fiscal year end following our listing on Nasdaq. There is\nno requirement under the Companies Law for us to hold annual or extraordinary general meetings to appoint directors. Until we hold an\nannual general meeting, public shareholders may not be afforded the opportunity to appoint directors and to discuss Company affairs with\nmanagement. Our board of directors is divided into three classes with only one class of directors being appointed in each year and each\nclass (except for those directors appointed prior to our first annual general meeting) serving a three-year term.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHolders of Class A ordinary shares will not be entitled to vote\non any appointment of directors prior to our initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPrior to our initial business combination, only holders of our founder\nshares will have the right to vote on the appointment of directors. Holders of our public shares will not be entitled to vote on the appointment\nof directors during such time. In addition, prior to our initial business combination, holders of a majority of our founder shares may\nremove a member of the board of directors for any reason. Accordingly, you may not have any say in the management of our Company prior\nto the consummation of an initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nResources could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not\ncompleted, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we have\nnot consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only $10.00 per\npublic share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our detachable redeemable warrants will expire\nworthless and no distributable redeemable warrants will have been issued.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe anticipate that the investigation of each specific target business\nand the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial\nmanagement time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If we decide not to complete a specific initial\nbusiness combination, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore, if\nwe reach an agreement relating to a specific target business, we may fail to complete our initial business combination for any number\nof reasons including those beyond our control. Any such event will result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred which could materially\nadversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we have not consummated our initial business\ncombination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only $10.00 per public share, or less in certain circumstances,\non the liquidation of our trust account and our detachable redeemable warrants will expire worthless and no distributable redeemable warrants\nwill have been issued.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBecause we are neither limited to evaluating a target business in\na particular industry sector nor have we selected any specific target businesses with which to pursue our initial business combination,\nyou will be unable to ascertain the merits or risks of any particular target business\u2019s operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may pursue business combination opportunities in any sector, except\nthat we will not, under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, be permitted to effectuate our initial business\ncombination solely with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations. Because we have not yet selected or approached\nany specific target business with respect to a business combination, there is no basis to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any\nparticular target business\u2019s operations, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition or prospects. To the\nextent we complete our initial business combination, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations with which\nwe combine. For example, if we combine with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of sales or earnings,\nwe may be affected by the risks inherent in the business and operations of a financially unstable or a development stage entity. Although\nour officers and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we\nwill properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors or that we will have adequate time to complete due diligence. Furthermore,\nsome of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will\nadversely impact a target business. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will ultimately prove to be more favorable\nto investors than a direct investment, if such opportunity were available, in a business combination target. Accordingly, any holders\nwho choose to retain their securities following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such\nholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n37\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may seek acquisition opportunities in industries or sectors which\nmay or may not be outside of our management\u2019s area of expertise.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe will consider a business combination outside of our management\u2019s\narea of expertise if a business combination target is presented to us and we determine that such candidate offers an attractive acquisition\nopportunity for our Company. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular business combination\ntarget, we cannot assure you that we will adequately ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. We also cannot assure you\nthat an investment in our units will not ultimately prove to be less favorable to investors in us than a direct investment, if an opportunity\nwere available, in a business combination target. In the event we elect to pursue an acquisition outside of the areas of our management\u2019s\nexpertise, our management\u2019s expertise may not be directly applicable to its evaluation or operation, and the information contained\nin this report regarding the areas of our management\u2019s expertise would not be relevant to an understanding of the business that\nwe elect to acquire. As a result, our management may not be able to adequately ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors.\nAccordingly, any holders who choose to retain their securities following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value\nof their securities. Such holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough we have identified general criteria and guidelines that\nwe believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses, we may enter into our initial business combination with a target\nthat does not meet such criteria and guidelines, and as a result, the target business with which we enter into our initial business combination\nmay not have attributes entirely consistent with our general criteria and guidelines.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough we have identified general criteria and guidelines for evaluating\nprospective target businesses, it is possible that a target business with which we enter into our initial business combination will not\nhave all of these positive attributes. If we complete our initial business combination with a target that does not meet some or all of\nthese guidelines, such combination may not be as successful as a combination with a business that does meet all of our general criteria\nand guidelines. In addition, if we announce a prospective business combination with a target that does not meet our general criteria and\nguidelines, a greater number of shareholders may exercise their redemption rights, which may make it difficult for us to meet any closing\ncondition with a target business that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. In addition, if shareholder\napproval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, or we decide to obtain shareholder approval\nfor business or other reasons, it may be more difficult for us to attain shareholder approval of our initial business combination if the\ntarget business does not meet our general criteria and guidelines. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within\nthe required time period, our public shareholders may receive only $10.00 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation\nof our trust account and our detachable redeemable warrants will expire worthless and no distributable redeemable warrants will have been\nissued.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent accounting\nor investment banking firm, and consequently, you may have no assurance from an independent source that the price we are paying for the\nbusiness is fair to our shareholders from a financial point of view.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnless we complete our initial business combination with an affiliated\nentity, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly\nrenders valuation opinions that the price we are paying is fair to our shareholders from a financial point of view. If no opinion is obtained,\nour shareholders will be relying on the judgment of our board of directors, who will determine fair market value based on standards generally\naccepted by the financial community. Such standards used will be disclosed in our proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable,\nrelated to our initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may reincorporate in another jurisdiction in connection with\nour initial business combination, and such reincorporation may result in taxes imposed on shareholders.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may, in connection with our initial business combination and subject\nto requisite shareholder approval under the Companies Law, reincorporate in the jurisdiction in which the target company or business is\nlocated or in another jurisdiction. The transaction may require a shareholder or warrant holder to recognize taxable income in the jurisdiction\nin which the shareholder or warrant holder is a tax resident or in which its members are resident if it is a tax transparent entity. We\ndo not intend to make any cash distributions to shareholders or warrant holders to pay such taxes.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nShareholders or warrant holders may be subject to withholding taxes\nor other taxes with respect to their ownership of us after the reincorporation.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n38\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Relating to our Sponsor and Management\nTeam\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur ability to successfully effect our initial business combination\nand to be successful thereafter will be totally dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel, some of whom may join us following our\ninitial business combination. The loss of key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination\nbusiness.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur ability to successfully effect our initial business combination\nis dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel. We believe that our success depends on the continued service of our key personnel,\nat least until we have consummated our initial business combination. None of our officers are required to commit any specified amount\nof time to our affairs and, accordingly, they will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities,\nincluding identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. If our officers\u2019 and directors\u2019\nother business affairs require them to devote more substantial amounts of time to their other business activities, it could limit their\nability to devote time to our affairs and could have a negative impact on our ability to consummate our initial business combination.\nIn addition, we do not have employment agreements with, or key-man insurance on the life of, any of our officers. The unexpected loss\nof the services of our key personnel could have a detrimental effect on us.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe role of our key personnel after our initial business combination,\nhowever, remains to be determined. Although some of our key personnel serve in senior management or advisory positions following our initial\nbusiness combination, it is likely that most, if not all, of the management of the target business will remain in place. These individuals\nmay be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a public company which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping\nthem become familiar with such requirements. This could be expensive and time-consuming and could lead to various regulatory issues which\nmay adversely affect our operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are dependent upon our executive officers and directors and their\nloss could adversely affect our ability to operate.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of individuals\nand, in particular, our executive officers and directors. We believe that our success depends on the continued service of our officers\nand directors, at least until we have completed our initial business combination. In addition, our executive officers and directors are\nnot required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating their\ntime among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence.\nWe do not have an employment agreement with, or key-man insurance on the life of, any of our directors or executive officers.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our directors\nor executive officers could have a detrimental effect on us.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements\nwith a target business in connection with a particular business combination, and a particular business combination may be conditioned\non the retention or resignation of such key personnel. These agreements may provide for them to receive compensation following our initial\nbusiness combination and as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business combination\nis the most advantageous.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur key personnel may be able to remain with our Company after the\ncompletion of our initial business combination only if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with\nthe business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could\nprovide for such individuals to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render\nto us after the completion of the business combination. Such negotiations also could make such key personnel\u2019s retention or resignation\na condition to any such agreement. The personal and financial interests of such individuals may influence their motivation in identifying\nand selecting a target business. In addition, pursuant to an agreement to be entered into on or prior to the closing of our IPO, our sponsor,\nupon and following consummation of an initial business combination, will be entitled to nominate three individuals for appointment to\nour board of directors, as long as our sponsor holds any securities covered by the registration and shareholder rights agreement filed\u202fas\nan exhibit to this report.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n39\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSince our sponsor, executive officers and directors will lose their\nentire investment in us if our initial business combination is not completed (other than with respect to public shares they may acquire),\na conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for our initial business\ncombination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn November 11, 2020, our sponsor paid $25,000, or approximately $0.003\nper share, to cover certain of our IPO and formation costs in consideration of 7,187,500 Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001. On\nJanuary 11, 2021, we effected a share capitalization resulting in our sponsor holding 7,500,000 Class B ordinary shares. Prior to the\ninitial investment in the Company of $25,000 by our sponsor, the Company had no assets, tangible or intangible. The per-share price of\nthe founder shares was determined by dividing the amount contributed to the Company by the number of founder shares issued. The founder\nshares will be worthless if we do not complete an initial business combination. In addition, our sponsor has purchased 5,566,667 private\nplacement warrants, each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment, at a price of\n$1.50 per warrant ($8,350,000 in the aggregate). If we do not consummate an initial business within 24 months from the closing of our\nIPO, the private placement warrants will expire worthless. The personal and financial interests of our executive officers and directors\nmay influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business combination, completing an initial business combination\nand influencing the operation of the business following our initial business combination. This risk may become more acute as the 24-month\nanniversary of the closing of our IPO nears, which is generally the deadline for our consummation of an initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur executive officers and directors will allocate their time to\nother businesses thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs. This conflict\nof interest could have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur executive officers and directors are not required to, and will\nnot, commit their full time to our affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations\nand our search for a business combination and their other businesses. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion\nof our initial business combination. Each of our executive officers is engaged in several other business endeavors for which he may be\nentitled to substantial compensation, and our executive officers are not obligated to contribute any specific number of hours per week\nto our affairs. Our independent directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities. If our executive officers\u2019\nand directors\u2019 other business affairs require them to devote substantial amounts of time to such affairs in excess of their current\ncommitment levels, it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs which may have a negative impact on our ability to complete\nour initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur officers and directors presently have, and any of them in the\nfuture may have, additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities, including another blank check company, and, accordingly,\nmay have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFollowing the completion of our IPO and until we consummate our initial\nbusiness combination, we intend to engage in the business of identifying and combining with one or more businesses or entities. Each of\nour officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to other\nentities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity,\nsubject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. Accordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in determining to which\nentity a particular business opportunity should be presented. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and a potential target\nbusiness may be presented to another entity prior to its presentation to us, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n40\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, our Founder, sponsor, officers and directors may in the\nfuture become affiliated with other blank check companies that may have acquisition objectives that are similar to ours. Accordingly,\nthey may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. These conflicts\nmay not be resolved in our favor and a potential target business may be presented to such other blank check companies prior to its presentation\nto us, subject to our officers\u2019 and directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. Our amended and restated memorandum\nand articles of association provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or\nan officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly\nin the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or being offering\nan opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for any director or officer,\non the one hand, and us, on the other.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur executive officers, directors, security holders and their respective\naffiliates may have competitive pecuniary interests that conflict with our interests.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our directors,\nexecutive officers, security holders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect pecuniary or financial interest in any investment\nto be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest. Nor do we have a policy that expressly\nprohibits any such persons from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. Accordingly, such\npersons or entities may have a conflict between their interests and ours.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe personal and financial interests of our directors and officers\nmay influence their motivation in timely identifying and selecting a target business and completing a business combination. Consequently,\nour directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 discretion in identifying and selecting a suitable target business may result in a conflict of\ninterest when determining whether the terms, conditions and timing of a particular business combination are appropriate and in our shareholders\u2019\nbest interest. If this were the case, it would be a breach of their fiduciary duties to us as a matter of Cayman Islands law and we or\nour shareholders might have a claim against such individuals for infringing on our shareholders\u2019 rights. However, we might not ultimately\nbe successful in any claim we may make against them for such reason.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may engage in a business combination with one or more target\nbusinesses that have relationships with entities that may be affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors which may raise\npotential conflicts of interest.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn light of the involvement of our sponsor, executive officers and\ndirectors with other entities, we may decide to acquire one or more businesses affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors.\nOur directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities, including, without limitation, those described under \u201cManagement\u2014Conflicts\nof Interest.\u201d Our Founder, sponsor, officers and directors may sponsor, form or participate in other blank check companies similar\nto ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Such entities may compete with us for business combination\nopportunities. Our Founder, sponsor, officers and directors are not currently aware of any specific opportunities for us to complete our\ninitial business combination with any entities with which they are affiliated, and there have been no substantive discussions concerning\na business combination with any such entity or entities. Although we will not be specifically focusing on, or targeting, any transaction\nwith any affiliated entities, we would pursue such a transaction if we determined that such affiliated entity met our criteria and guidelines\nfor a business combination as set forth in \u201cProposed Business\u2014Effecting Our Initial Business Combination\u2014Evaluation\nof a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination\u201d and such transaction was approved by a majority of our\nindependent and disinterested directors. Despite our agreement to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another\nindependent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions regarding the fairness to our Company from a financial point of view of a\nbusiness combination with one or more domestic or international businesses affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors,\npotential conflicts of interest still may exist and, as a result, the terms of the business combination may not be as advantageous to\nour public shareholders as they would be absent any conflicts of interest.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n41\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur sponsor controls a substantial interest in us and thus may exert\na substantial influence on actions requiring a shareholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur sponsor owns, on an as-converted basis, 20% of our issued and outstanding\nordinary shares. Accordingly, it may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a shareholder vote, potentially in a manner that\nyou do not support, including amendments to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. If our sponsor purchases\nany additional Class A ordinary shares in the aftermarket or in privately negotiated transactions, this would increase its control. Neither\nour sponsor nor, to our knowledge, any of our officers or directors, have any current intention to purchase additional securities, other\nthan as disclosed in this report. Factors that would be considered in making such additional purchases would include consideration of\nthe current trading price of our Class A ordinary shares. In addition, our board of directors, whose members were appointed by our sponsor,\nis and will be divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors\nbeing appointed in each year. We may not hold an annual general meeting to appoint new directors prior to the completion of our initial\nbusiness combination, in which case all of the current directors will continue in office until at least the completion of the business\ncombination. If there is an annual general meeting, as a consequence of our \u201cstaggered\u201d board of directors, only a minority\nof the board of directors will be considered for appointment and our sponsor, because of its ownership position, will control the outcome,\nas only holders of our Class B ordinary shares will have the right to vote on the appointment of directors and to remove directors prior\nto our initial business combination. In addition, the founder shares, all of which are held by our sponsor, will, in a vote to transfer\nthe Company by way of continuation out of the Cayman Islands to another jurisdiction (which requires the approval of at least two thirds\nof the votes of all ordinary shares), entitle the holders to ten votes for every founder share. This provision of our amended and restated\nmemorandum and articles of association may only be amended by a special resolution passed by a majority of at least two-thirds of our\nordinary shares voting in a general meeting. As a result, you will not have any influence over our continuation in a jurisdiction outside\nthe Cayman Islands prior to our initial business combination. Accordingly, our sponsor will continue to exert control at least until the\ncompletion of our initial business combination. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial\nbusiness combination without the prior consent of our sponsor.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Relating to Our Securities\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe securities in which we invest the proceeds held in the trust\naccount could bear a negative rate of interest, which could reduce the interest income available for payment of taxes or reduce the value\nof the assets held in trust such that the per share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.00 per share.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe net proceeds of our IPO and certain proceeds from the sale of the\nprivate placement warrants, in the amount of $275,000,000, will be held in an interest-bearing trust account. The proceeds held in the\ntrust account may only be invested in direct U.S. Treasury obligations having a maturity of 185\u00a0days or less, or in certain money\nmarket funds which invest only in direct U.S. Treasury obligations. While short-term U.S.\u00a0Treasury obligations currently yield a\npositive rate of interest, they have briefly yielded negative interest rates in recent years. Central banks in Europe and Japan pursued\ninterest rates below zero in recent years, and the Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve has not ruled out the possibility that\nit may in the future adopt similar policies in the United\u00a0States. In the event of very low or negative yields, the amount of interest\nincome (which we may withdraw to pay income taxes, if any) would be reduced. In the event that we are unable to complete our initial business\ncombination, our public shareholders are entitled to receive their pro-rata share of the proceeds held in the trust account, plus any\ninterest income. If the balance of the trust account is reduced below $275,000,000 as a result of negative interest rates, the amount\nof funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public shareholders may be reduced below $10.00 per share.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment\nCompany Act, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it\ndifficult for us to complete our initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company\nAct, our activities may be restricted, including:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nrestrictions on the nature of our investments; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nrestrictions on the issuance of securities,\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\neach of which may make it difficult for us to complete our initial\nbusiness combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, we may have imposed upon us burdensome requirements, including:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nregistration as an investment company with the SEC;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nadoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n42\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nreporting, record keeping, voting, proxy and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations that we are currently not subject to.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn order not to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment\nCompany Act, unless we can qualify for an exclusion, we must ensure that we are engaged primarily in a business other than investing,\nreinvesting or trading of securities and that our activities do not include investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading \u201cinvestment\nsecurities\n\u201d\n constituting more than 40% of our assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated\nbasis. Our business will be to identify and complete a business combination and thereafter to operate the post-transaction business or\nassets for the long term. We do not plan to buy businesses or assets with a view to resale or profit from their resale. We do not plan\nto buy unrelated businesses or assets or to be a passive investor.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject\nus to the Investment Company Act. To this end, the proceeds held in the trust account may only be invested in United\u00a0States \u201cgovernment\nsecurities\n\u201d\n within the meaning of Section\u00a02(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 185\u00a0days\nor less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule\u00a02a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest\nonly in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Pursuant to the trust agreement, the trustee is not permitted to invest in other\nsecurities or assets. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, and by having a business plan targeted at acquiring\nand growing businesses for the long term (rather than on buying and selling businesses in the manner of a merchant bank or private equity\nfund), we intend to avoid being deemed an \u201cinvestment company\n\u201d \nwithin the meaning of the Investment Company Act. Our\nsecurities are not intended for persons who are seeking a return on investments in government securities or investment securities. The\ntrust account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earliest to occur of either: (i)\u00a0the completion of our initial\nbusiness combination; (ii)\u00a0the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our\namended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A)\u00a0to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders\nof our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to\nredeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO or\n(B)\u00a0with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares; or (iii)\u00a0absent\nour completing an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our IPO, our return of the funds held in the trust\naccount to our public shareholders as part of our redemption of the public shares. If we do not invest the proceeds as discussed above,\nwe may be deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act. If we were deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance\nwith these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expenses for which we have not allotted funds and may hinder our ability\nto complete a business combination. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public\nshareholders may receive only $10.00 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account, our\ndetachable redeemable warrants will expire worthless and no distributable redeemable warrants will have been issued.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination\nand we do not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, and if you or a \u201cgroup\u201d of shareholders are deemed to\nhold in excess of 15% of our Class A ordinary shares, you will lose the ability to redeem all such shares in excess of 15% of our Class\nA ordinary shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination\nand we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended\nand restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder\nor any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup\u201d (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange\nAct), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our IPO, which\nwe refer to as the \u201cExcess Shares,\u201d without our prior consent. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders\u2019\nability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. Your inability to redeem\nthe Excess Shares will reduce your influence over our ability to complete our initial business combination and you could suffer a material\nloss on your investment in us if you sell Excess Shares in open market transactions. Additionally, you will not receive redemption distributions\nwith respect to the Excess Shares if we complete our initial business combination. And as a result, you will continue to hold that number\nof shares exceeding 15% and, in order to dispose of such shares, would be required to sell your shares in open market transactions, potentially\nat a loss.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n43\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which\ncould limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have been approved to have our units listed on Nasdaq and to have\nour Class A ordinary shares and detachable redeemable warrants listed on or promptly after their date of separation. Although after giving\neffect to our IPO we expect to meet, on a pro forma basis, the minimum initial listing standards set forth in Nasdaq listing standards,\nwe cannot assure you that our securities will continue to be listed on Nasdaq in the future or prior to our initial business combination.\nIn order to continue listing our securities on Nasdaq prior to our initial business combination, we must maintain certain financial, distribution\nand share price levels, such as a minimum market capitalization (generally $50,000,000) and a minimum number of holders of our securities\n(generally 400 public holders).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, our units will not be traded after completion of our\ninitial business combination and, in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to demonstrate compliance with\nNasdaq\u2019s initial listing requirements, which are more rigorous than Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements, in order to continue\nto maintain the listing of our securities on Nasdaq. For instance, our share price would generally be required to be at least $4.00 per\nshare and our shareholder\u2019s equity would generally be required to be at least $4.0 million. We may not be able to meet those listing\nrequirements at that time, especially if there are a significant number of redemptions in connection with our initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange and we\nare not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect our securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter\nmarket. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\na limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nreduced liquidity for our securities;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\na determination that our Class A ordinary shares are a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our Class A ordinary shares to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a\nfederal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as \u201ccovered\nsecurities.\u201d Because our units are and eventually our Class A ordinary shares and redeemable warrants will be listed on Nasdaq,\nour units, Class A ordinary shares and redeemable warrants will qualify as covered securities under the statute. Although the states are\npreempted from regulating the sale of covered securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there\nis a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities\nin a particular case. While we are not aware of a state having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued\nby blank check companies, other than the State of Idaho, certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and\nmight use these powers, or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states. Further,\nif we were no longer listed on Nasdaq, our securities would not qualify as covered securities under the statute and we would be subject\nto regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n44\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may issue additional Class A ordinary shares or preference shares\nto complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan after completion of our initial business combination.\nWe may also issue Class A ordinary shares upon the conversion of the founder shares at a ratio greater than one-to-one at the time of\nour initial business combination as a result of the anti-dilution provisions contained in our amended and restated memorandum and articles\nof association. Any such issuances would dilute the interest of our shareholders and likely present other risks.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association authorize\nthe issuance of up to 500,000,000 Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, 50,000,000 Class B ordinary shares, par value\n$0.0001 per share, and 5,000,000 preference shares, par value $0.0001 per share. There are 470,000,000 and 42,500,000 authorized but unissued\nClass A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares, respectively, available for issuance which amount does not take into account shares\nreserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding warrants or shares issuable upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares, if any.\nThe Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares (which such Class A ordinary shares delivered upon\nconversion will not have any redemption rights or be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account if we fail to consummate\nan initial business combination) at the time of our initial business combination or earlier at the option of the holders thereof as described\nherein and in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. There are no preference shares issued and outstanding.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may issue a substantial number of additional Class A ordinary shares\nor preference shares to complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan after completion of our initial\nbusiness combination. We may also issue Class A ordinary shares in connection with our redeeming the warrants as described in \u201cDescription\nof Securities\u2014Warrants\u2014Public Shareholders\u2019 Warrants\u201d or upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares at a ratio\ngreater than one-to-one at the time of our initial business combination as a result of the anti-dilution provisions as set forth herein.\nHowever, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide, among other things, that prior to or in connection with\nour initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from\nthe trust account or (ii) vote on any initial business combination or on any other proposal presented to shareholders prior to or in connection\nwith the completion of an initial business combination. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association,\nlike all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote. The issuance\nof additional ordinary or preference shares:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nmay significantly dilute the equity interest of existing investors, which dilution would increase if the anti-dilution provisions in the Class B ordinary shares resulted in the issuance of Class A ordinary shares on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nmay subordinate the rights of holders of Class A ordinary shares if preference shares are issued with rights senior to those afforded our Class A ordinary shares;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\ncould cause a change in control if a substantial number of Class A ordinary shares are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nmay have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the share ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nmay adversely affect prevailing market prices for our units, Class A ordinary shares and/or warrants; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nmay not result in adjustment to the exercise price of our warrants.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n45\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are not registering the Class\u00a0A ordinary shares issuable\nupon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws at this time, and such registration may not be in\nplace when an investor desires to exercise warrants, thus precluding such investor from being able to exercise its warrants except on\na cashless basis and potentially causing such warrants to expire worthless.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are not registering the Class\u00a0A ordinary shares issuable upon\nexercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws at this time. However, under the terms of the warrant agreement,\nwe have agreed that, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 20 business days after the closing of our initial business combination,\nwe will use our commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement covering the issuance of such shares, and\nwe will use our commercially reasonable efforts to cause the same to become effective within 60 business days after the closing of our\ninitial business combination and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement and a current prospectus relating to those\nClass\u00a0A ordinary shares until the warrants expire or are redeemed. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so if, for example,\nany facts or events arise which represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement or prospectus,\nthe financial statements contained or incorporated by reference therein are not current, complete or correct or the SEC\u00a0issues a\nstop order. If the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities\u00a0Act in accordance with the\nabove requirements, we will be required to permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, in which case, the number of\nClass\u00a0A ordinary shares that you will receive upon cashless exercise will be based on a formula subject to a maximum amount of shares\nequal to 0.361 Class\u00a0A ordinary shares per warrant (subject to adjustment). However, no warrant will be exercisable for cash or on\na cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance\nof the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption\nfrom registration is available. Notwithstanding the above, if our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares are at the time of any exercise of a warrant\nnot listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a \u201ccovered security\n\u201d \nunder Section\u00a018(b)(1)\nof the Securities Act, we may, at our option, require holders of public warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a \u201ccashless\nbasis\n\u201d\n in accordance with Section\u00a03(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event we so elect, we will not be required\nto file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the\nshares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. Exercising the warrants on a cashless basis could have\nthe effect of reducing the potential \u201cupside\n\u201d \nof the holder\u2019s investment in our Company because the warrant holder\nwill hold a smaller number of Class\u00a0A ordinary shares upon a cashless exercise of the warrants they hold. In no event will we be\nrequired to net cash settle any warrant, or issue securities or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event that we are\nunable to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under applicable state securities laws and no exemption is available.\nIf the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the warrants is not so registered or qualified or exempt from registration or qualification,\nthe holder of such warrant shall not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In\nsuch event, holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase of units will have paid the full unit purchase price solely for\nthe Class\u00a0A ordinary shares included in the units. There may be a circumstance where an exemption from registration exists for holders\nof our private placement warrants to exercise their warrants while a corresponding exemption does not exist for holders of our public\nwarrants. In such an instance, our sponsor and its permitted transferees (which may include our directors and executive officers) would\nbe able to exercise their warrants and sell the ordinary shares underlying their warrants while holders of our public warrants would not\nbe able to exercise their warrants and sell the underlying ordinary shares. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise\nour redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying Class\u00a0A ordinary shares for sale under all applicable\nstate securities laws. As a result, we may redeem the warrants as set forth above even if the holders are otherwise unable to exercise\ntheir warrants.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe warrants may become exercisable and redeemable for a security\nother than the Class\u00a0A ordinary shares, and you will not have any information regarding such other security at this time.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn certain situations, including if we are not the surviving entity\nin our initial business combination, the warrants may become exercisable for a security other than the Class\u00a0A ordinary shares. As\na result, if the surviving company redeems your warrants for securities pursuant to the warrant agreement, you may receive a security\nin a company of which you do not have information at this time. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, the surviving company will be required\nto use commercially reasonable efforts to register the issuance of the security underlying the warrants within twenty business days of\nthe closing of an initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf you elect to exercise your redemption rights with respect to\nyour Class A ordinary shares, you will not receive any distributable redeemable warrants.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn connection with our initial business combination, public shareholders\nwill have the opportunity to exercise their right to redeem their Class A ordinary shares. However, our distributable redeemable warrants\nwill be distributed only to the holders of record of those Class A ordinary shares that remain outstanding after such redemptions. Accordingly,\nto the extent that you elect to redeem your Class A ordinary shares, you will receive no distributable redeemable warrants in respect\nof such shares. The contingent right to receive distributable redeemable warrants will remain attached to our Class A ordinary shares,\nwill not be separately transferable, assignable or salable and will not be evidenced by any certificate or instrument.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n46\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe grant of registration rights to our sponsor may make it more\ndifficult to complete our initial business combination, and the future exercise of such rights may adversely affect the market price of\nour Class\u00a0A ordinary shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPursuant to an agreement to be entered into on or prior to the closing\nof our IPO, our sponsor and its permitted transferees can demand that we register the resale of the Class\u00a0A ordinary shares into\nwhich founder shares are convertible, the private placement warrants and the Class\u00a0A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the\nprivate placement warrants, and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans and the Class\u00a0A ordinary shares\nissuable upon conversion of such warrants. The registration and availability of such a significant number of securities for trading in\nthe public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares. In addition, the existence of the\nregistration rights may make our initial business combination more costly or difficult to conclude. This is because the shareholders of\nthe target business may increase the equity stake they seek in the combined entity or ask for more cash consideration to offset the negative\nimpact on the market price of our securities that is expected when the securities owned by our sponsor or its permitted transferees are\nregistered for resale.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur warrants are expected to be accounted for as derivative liabilities\nand will be recorded at fair value upon issuance with changes in fair value each period reported in earnings, which may have an adverse\neffect on the market price of our ordinary shares or may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe account for both the warrants underlying the units sold in our IPO,\nand the private placement warrants, as a warrant liability in accordance with the guidance contained in Derivatives and Hedging \u2013\nContracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (ASC 815- 40). Such guidance provides that because the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity\ntreatment thereunder, each warrant must be recorded as a liability. At each reporting period (1) the accounting treatment of the warrants\nwill be re-evaluated for proper accounting treatment as a liability or equity and (2) the fair value of the liability of the public and\nprivate warrants will be remeasured and the change in the fair value of the liability will be recorded as other income (expense) in our\nincome statement. Changes in the inputs and assumptions for the valuation model we use to determine the fair value of such liability may\nhave a material impact on the estimated fair value of the embedded derivative liability. The price of our ordinary shares represents the\nprimary underlying variable that impacts the value of the derivative instruments. Additional factors that impact the value of the derivative\ninstruments include the volatility of our ordinary share price, discount rates and stated interest rates. As a result, our financial statements\nand results of operations will fluctuate quarterly, based on various factors, such as the price of our ordinary shares, many of which\nfactors are outside our control. In addition, we may change the underlying assumptions used in our valuation model, which could in result\nin significant fluctuations in our results of operations. If our ordinary share price is volatile, we expect that we may recognize non-cash\ngains or losses on our warrants or any other similar derivative instruments each reporting period, and that the amount of such gains or\nlosses could be material. The impact of changes in fair value on earnings may have an adverse effect on the market price of our ordinary\nshares. In addition, potential targets may seek a special purpose acquisition company that does not have warrants that are accounted for\nas a liability, which may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination with a target business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnlike some other similarly structured blank check companies, our\nsponsor will receive additional Class\u00a0A ordinary shares if we issue shares to consummate an initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe founder shares will automatically convert into Class\u00a0A ordinary\nshares (which such Class\u00a0A ordinary shares delivered upon conversion will not have any redemption rights or be entitled to liquidating\ndistributions from the trust account if we fail to consummate an initial business combination) at the time of our initial business combination\nor earlier at the option of the holders thereof at a ratio such that the number of Class\u00a0A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion\nof all founder shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of (i)\u00a0the total number of our ordinary\nshares issued and outstanding, plus (ii)\u00a0the total number of Class\u00a0A ordinary shares issued or deemed issued or issuable upon\nconversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities or rights issued or deemed issued, by the Company in connection with or in relation\nto the consummation of our initial business combination, excluding any Class\u00a0A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities exercisable\nfor or convertible into Class\u00a0A ordinary shares issued, deemed issued, or to be issued, to any seller in our initial business combination\nand any private placement warrants issued to our sponsor, any of its affiliates or any members of our management team upon conversion\nof working capital loans. In no event will the Class\u00a0B ordinary shares convert into Class\u00a0A ordinary shares at a rate of less\nthan one-to-one. This is different than some other similarly structured blank check companies in which our sponsor will only be issued\nan aggregate of 20% of the total number of shares to be outstanding prior to our initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n47\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may amend the terms of the redeemable warrants in a manner that\nmay be adverse to holders of public warrants with the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then-outstanding public warrants.\nAs a result, the exercise price of your warrants could be increased, the redeemable warrants could be converted into cash or Class\u00a0A\nordinary shares (at a ratio different than initially provided), the exercise period could be shortened and the number of our Class\u00a0A\nordinary shares purchasable upon exercise of a warrant could be decreased, all without your approval.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur redeemable warrants will be issued in registered form under a warrant\nagreement between Continental Stock Transfer\u00a0& Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the\nterms of the redeemable warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder for the purpose of (i)\u00a0curing any ambiguity or\ncorrecting any mistake, including to conform the provisions of the warrant agreement to the description of the terms of the warrants and\nthe warrant agreement set forth in the prospectus for our IPO, or defective provision (ii)\u00a0amending the provisions relating to cash\ndividends on ordinary shares as contemplated by and in accordance with the warrant agreement or (iii)\u00a0adding or changing any provisions\nwith respect to matters or questions arising under the warrant agreement as the parties to the warrant agreement may deem necessary or\ndesirable and that the parties deem to not adversely affect the rights of the registered holders of the warrants, provided that the approval\nby the holders of at least 50% of the then-outstanding redeemable warrants is required to make any change that adversely affects the interests\nof the registered holders of redeemable warrants. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the redeemable warrants in a manner adverse to\na holder if holders of at least 50% of the then-outstanding redeemable warrants approve of such amendment, and, solely with respect to\nany amendment to the terms of the private placement warrants or any provision of the warrant agreement with respect to the private placement\nwarrants, 50% of the number of the then outstanding private placement warrants. Although our ability to amend the terms of the redeemable\nwarrants with the consent of at least 50% of the then-outstanding redeemable warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could\nbe amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, convert the warrants into cash or Class\u00a0A ordinary\nshares (at a ratio different than initially provided), shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of Class\u00a0A ordinary shares\npurchasable upon exercise of a warrant.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur warrant agreement will designate the courts of the State of\nNew\u00a0York or the United\u00a0States District Court for the Southern District of New\u00a0York as the sole and exclusive forum for\ncertain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by holders of our warrants, which could limit the ability of warrant holders\nto obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with our Company.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur warrant agreement provides that, subject to applicable law, (i)\u00a0any\naction, proceeding or claim against us arising out of or relating in any way to the warrant agreement, including under the Securities\nAct, will be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New\u00a0York or the United\u00a0States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New\u00a0York, and (ii)\u00a0that we irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction shall be the exclusive forum\nfor any such action, proceeding or claim. We will waive any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and that such courts represent an\ninconvenient forum.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, these provisions of the warrant agreement\nwill not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal\ndistrict courts of the United\u00a0States of America are the sole and exclusive forum. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring\nany interest in any of our warrants shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the forum provisions in our warrant agreement.\nIf any action, the subject matter of which is within the scope the forum provisions of the warrant agreement, is filed in a court other\nthan a court of the State of New\u00a0York or the United\u00a0States District Court for the Southern District of New\u00a0York (a \u201cforeign\naction\n\u201d\n) in the name of any holder of our warrants, such holder shall be deemed to have consented to: (x)\u00a0the personal\njurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of New\u00a0York in connection with any action brought in any such court\nto enforce the forum provisions (an \u201cenforcement action\n\u201d\n), and (y)\u00a0having service of process made upon such warrant\nholder in any such enforcement action by service upon such warrant holder\u2019s counsel in the foreign action as agent for such warrant\nholder.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis choice-of-forum provision may limit a warrant holder\u2019s ability\nto bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with our Company, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively,\nif a court were to find this provision of our warrant agreement inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified\ntypes of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could\nmaterially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and\nresources of our management and board of directors.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n48\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at\na time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your warrants worthless.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have the ability to redeem the outstanding public warrants at any\ntime after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per warrant,\u00a0\nprovided\u00a0\nthat the\nclosing price of our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares\nissuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described in the prospectus for our IPO under the heading \u201cDescription\nof Securities\u2014Warrants\u2014Public Shareholders\u2019 Warrants\u2014Anti-dilution Adjustments\n\u201d\n) for any 20 trading\ndays within a 30\u00a0trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to proper notice of such redemption and\u00a0\nprovided\u00a0\nthat\ncertain other conditions are met. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are\nunable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. As a result, we may redeem\nthe warrants as set forth above even if the holders are otherwise unable to exercise the warrants. Redemption of the outstanding warrants\ncould force you to (i)\u00a0exercise your warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you\nto do so, (ii)\u00a0sell your warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants or (iii)\u00a0accept\nthe nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, we expect would be substantially less\nthan the market value of your warrants.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, we have the ability to redeem the outstanding public warrants\nat any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.10 per warrant upon a minimum of 30\u00a0days\u2019\nprior written notice of redemption\u00a0\nprovided\u00a0\nthat the closing price of our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares equals or exceeds\n$10.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described\nin the prospectus for our IPO under the heading \u201cDescription of Securities\u2014Warrants\u2014Public Shareholders\u2019 Warrants\u2014Anti-dilution\nAdjustments\n\u201d\n) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to proper notice\nof such redemption and\u00a0\nprovided\u00a0\nthat certain other conditions are met, including that holders will be able to exercise\ntheir warrants prior to redemption for a number of Class\u00a0A ordinary shares determined based on the redemption date and the fair market\nvalue of our Class\u00a0A ordinary shares. See the discussion in the prospectus for our IPO under the heading \u201cDescription of Securities\u2014Warrants\u2014Public\nShareholders\u2019 Warrants\u2014Redemption of warrants when the price per Class\u00a0A ordinary share equals or exceeds $10.00.\n\u201d\n\nThe value received upon exercise of the warrants (1)\u00a0may be less than the value the holders would have received if they had exercised\ntheir warrants at a later time where the underlying share price is higher and (2)\u00a0may not compensate the holders for the value of\nthe warrants, including because the number of ordinary shares received is capped at 0.361 Class\u00a0A ordinary shares per warrant (subject\nto adjustment) irrespective of the remaining life of the warrants.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of our\nClass\u00a0A ordinary shares and make it more difficult to effectuate our initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have issued detachable redeemable warrants to purchase 5,000,000\nClass\u00a0A ordinary shares as part of the units offered in our IPO and 5,566,667 private placement warrants, each exercisable to purchase\none Class\u00a0A ordinary share at $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. In addition, if our sponsor, its affiliates or a member of\nour management team makes any working capital loans, it may convert up to $2,000,000 of such loans into up to an additional 1,333,333\nprivate placement warrants, at the price of $1.50 per warrant. We may also issue Class\u00a0A ordinary shares in connection with our redemption\nof our warrants.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo the extent we issue ordinary shares for any reason, including to\neffectuate a business combination, the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional Class\u00a0A ordinary shares upon\nexercise of these warrants could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle to a target business. Such warrants, when exercised, will\nincrease the number of issued and outstanding Class\u00a0A ordinary shares and reduce the value of the Class\u00a0A ordinary shares issued\nto complete the business transaction. Therefore, our warrants may make it more difficult to effectuate a business transaction or increase\nthe cost of acquiring the target business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBecause each unit contains one-sixth of one redeemable warrant and\nonly a whole warrant may be exercised, the units may be worth less than units of other blank check companies.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEach unit contains one-sixth of one detachable redeemable warrant.\nPursuant to the warrant agreement, no fractional redeemable warrants will be issued upon separation of the units, and only whole warrants\nwill trade. If, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, we will, upon exercise,\nround down to the nearest whole number the number of Class\u00a0A ordinary shares to be issued to the warrant holder. In addition, although\nholders of Class\u00a0A ordinary shares who elect not to redeem such shares in connection with our initial business combination will also\nreceive a distribution of redeemable warrants in the form of distributable redeemable warrants, it may be that the number of distributable\nredeemable warrants issuable to any such holder, with or without any fractional detachable redeemable warrants they may hold, will not\nconstitute a whole warrant. This is different from other offerings similar to ours whose units include one ordinary share and one whole\nwarrant to purchase one whole share. We have established the components of the units in this way in order to reduce the dilutive effect\nof the warrants upon completion of a business combination since the detachable redeemable warrants and the distributable redeemable warrants\nwill be exercisable in the aggregate for one-third of the number of shares, compared to units that each contain a whole warrant to purchase\none whole share, thus making us, we believe, a more attractive merger partner for target businesses. Nevertheless, this unit structure\nmay cause our units to be worth less than if a unit included a warrant to purchase one whole share.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n49\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe market for our securities may not develop sufficiently and remain\nsufficiently active, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe price of our securities may vary significantly due to one or more\npotential business combinations and general market or economic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. An active trading\nmarket for our securities may never develop sufficiently or, if developed, it may not be sustained. You may be unable to sell your securities\nunless a sufficiently active trading market can be sustained.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nProvisions in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of\nassociation may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our Class A\nordinary shares and could entrench management.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contain\nprovisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that shareholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions\nwill include a staggered board of directors, the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preference\nshares, and the fact that prior to the completion of our initial business combination only holders of our Class B ordinary shares, which\nhave been issued to our sponsor, are entitled to vote on the appointment of directors, which may make more difficult the removal of management\nand may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur sponsor paid an aggregate\nof $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per founder share, and, accordingly, holders of our Class A ordinary shares have experienced immediate\nand substantial dilution upon their purchase of our Class A ordinary shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe difference between the market price per share of our Class A ordinary\nshares (allocating all of the unit purchase price to the Class A ordinary shares and none to the warrants included in the unit) and the\npro forma net tangible book value per share of our Class A ordinary shares constitutes dilution to holders of our Class A ordinary shares.\nOur sponsor acquired the founder shares at a nominal price, contributing significantly to this dilution. This dilution would increase\nto the extent that the anti-dilution provisions of the Class B ordinary shares result in the issuance of Class A ordinary shares on a\ngreater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares at the time of our initial business combination, and would\nfurther increase to the extent that public shareholders seek redemptions from the trust. In addition, because of the anti-dilution protections\nprovided in the founder shares to the holders of such shares, any equity or equity-linked securities issued in connection with our initial\nbusiness combination would be disproportionately dilutive to our Class A ordinary shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe nominal purchase price\npaid by our sponsor for the founder shares may result in significant dilution to the implied value of your public shares upon the consummation\nof our initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe offered our units at an offering price of $10.00 per unit and the\namount in our trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share, implying an initial value of $10.00 per public share.\nHowever, prior to the IPO, our sponsor paid a nominal aggregate purchase price of $25,000 for the founder shares, or approximately $0.003\nper share. As a result, the value of your public shares may be significantly diluted upon the consummation of our initial business combination,\nwhen the founder shares are converted into public shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe value of the founder\nshares following completion of our initial business combination is likely to be substantially higher than the nominal price paid for them,\neven if the trading price of our ordinary shares at such time is substantially less than $10.00 per share.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUpon the closing of our IPO, our sponsor had invested in us an aggregate\nof $8,375,000, comprised of the $25,000 purchase price for the 7,500,000 founder shares and the $8,350,000 purchase price for the 5,566,667\nprivate placement warrants. Assuming a trading price of $10.00 per ordinary share upon consummation of our initial business combination,\nthe 7,500,000 founder shares would have an aggregate implied value of $75,000,000. As a result, our sponsor may be able to recoup its\ninvestment in us and make a substantial profit on that investment, even if our public shares have lost significant value, even though,\nconsistent with the vesting terms to which the founder shares are subject, our sponsor will not be able to realize more than half the\nvalue of its investment unless the trading price of the ordinary shares rises beyond $10.00 per share following the consummation of our\ninitial business combination. Accordingly, our sponsor, and our management team, which owns interests in our sponsor, may have an economic\nincentive that differs from that of the public shareholders to pursue and consummate an initial business combination rather than to liquidate\nand return the cash in trust to our public shareholders, even if that business combination were with a riskier or less-established target\nbusiness. For the foregoing reasons, you should consider our sponsor\u2019s and management team\u2019s financial incentive to complete an\ninitial business combination when evaluating whether to redeem your shares prior to or in connection with an initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAdditional Risk Factors\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe were incorporated in November 2020 and we have no operating history\nand no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe were incorporated in November 2020 under the laws of the Cayman\nIslands and we have no operating history and no revenues. Because we lack an operating history, you have no basis upon which to evaluate\nour ability to achieve our business objective of completing our initial business combination with one or more target businesses. We have\nno plans, arrangements or understandings with any prospective target business concerning a business combination and may be unable to complete\nour initial business combination. If we fail to complete our initial business combination, we will never generate any operating revenues.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPast performance by our management team or their respective affiliates\nmay not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us or in the future performance of any business we may acquire.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInformation regarding performance by, or businesses associated with,\nour management team and their respective affiliates is presented for informational purposes only, including information regarding the\nperformance of Purple. Any past experience or performance of our management team and their respective affiliates is not a guarantee of\neither (i) our ability to successfully identify and execute a transaction or (ii) success with respect to any business combination that\nwe may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of our management team or their respective affiliates as indicative of\nthe future performance of an investment in us or the returns we will, or are likely to, generate going forward.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCyber incidents or attacks directed at us could result in information\ntheft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe depend on digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure\nand cloud applications and services, including those of third parties with which we may deal. Sophisticated and deliberate attacks on,\nor security breaches in, our systems or infrastructure, or the systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud, could lead to\ncorruption or misappropriation of our assets, proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data. As an early stage company without\nsignificant investments in data security protection, we may not be sufficiently protected against such occurrences. We may not have sufficient\nresources to adequately protect against, or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to, cyber incidents. It is possible that any\nof these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have adverse consequences on our business and lead to financial loss.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSince only holders of our founder shares will have the right to\nvote on the appointment of directors, upon the listing of our shares on Nasdaq, Nasdaq may consider us to be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d\nwithin the meaning of Nasdaq rules and, as a result, we may qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOnly holders of our founder shares will have the right to vote on the\nappointment of directors. As a result, Nasdaq may consider us to be a \u201ccontrolled company\n\u201d\n within the meaning of Nasdaq\ncorporate governance standards. Under Nasdaq corporate governance standards, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held\nby an individual, group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\n\u201d\n and may elect not to comply with certain corporate\ngovernance requirements, including the requirements that:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nwe have a board that includes a majority of \u201cindependent directors,\n\u201d\n as defined under the rules of Nasdaq;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n51\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nwe have a compensation committee of our board that is comprised entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u27a4\n\n\nwe have a nominating and corporate governance committee of our board that is comprised entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe do not intend to utilize these exemptions and intend to comply with\nthe corporate governance requirements of Nasdaq, subject to applicable phase-in rules. However, if we determine in the future to utilize\nsome or all of these exemptions, you will not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all\nof Nasdaq corporate governance requirements.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are subject to changing law and regulations regarding regulatory\nmatters, corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of non-compliance. A failure to comply\nwith any laws and regulations may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business\ncombination and results of operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are subject to rules and regulations by various national, regional\nand local governments. In particular, we will be required to comply with rules and regulations of SEC, which is charged with the protection\nof investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded, as well as to new and evolving regulatory measures under\napplicable law. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Our efforts\nto comply with new and changing laws and regulations could also result in a diversion of management time and attention from seeking a\nbusiness combination target.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMoreover, because these laws, regulations and standards are subject\nto varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available. This evolution may result\nin continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance\npractices. Those changes could also have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws\nor regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our ability to negotiate and\ncomplete our initial business combination and results of operations. If we fail to address and comply with applicable law and regulations\nand any subsequent changes, we may be subject to penalty and our business may be harmed.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCompliance obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may make it\nmore difficult for us to effectuate a business combination, require substantial financial and management resources, and increase the time\nand costs of completing an acquisition.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and\nreport on our system of internal controls beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2021. Only in\nthe event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will\nwe not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over\nfinancial reporting. The fact that we are a blank check company makes compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly\nburdensome on us as compared to other public companies because a target business with which we seek to complete our initial business combination\nmay not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls. The development of\nthe internal control of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to\ncomplete any such acquisition.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company\nwithin the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to \u201cemerging\ngrowth companies\u201d or \u201csmaller reporting companies,\u201d this could make our securities less attractive to investors and\nmay make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d within the meaning\nof the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements\nthat are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not\nbeing required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations\nregarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding\nadvisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result,\nour shareholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to\nfive years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our Class A ordinary shares\nheld by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging\ngrowth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we\nwill rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions,\nthe trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities\nand the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n52\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth\ncompanies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that\nhave not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange\nAct) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to\nopt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an\nelection to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard\nis issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt\nthe new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial\nstatements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out\nof using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, we are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined\nin Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including,\namong other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last\nday of the fiscal year in which (1) the aggregate worldwide market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds\n$250 million as of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the aggregate\nworldwide market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30. To the extent\nwe take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies\ndifficult or impossible.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nChanges in the market for directors and officers liability insurance\ncould make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate and complete an initial business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn recent months, the market for directors and officers liability insurance\nfor special purpose acquisition companies has changed. Fewer insurance companies are offering quotes for directors and officers liability\ncoverage, the premiums charged for such policies have generally increased and the terms of such policies have generally become less favorable.\nThere can be no assurance that these trends will not continue.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe increased cost and decreased availability of directors and officers\nliability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate an initial business combination. In order to obtain\ndirectors and officers liability insurance or modify its coverage as a result of becoming a public company, the post-business combination\nentity might need to incur greater expense, accept less favorable terms or both. However, any failure to obtain adequate directors and\nofficers liability insurance could have an adverse impact on the post-business combination company\u2019s ability to attract and retain\nqualified officers and directors.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, even after we were to complete an initial business combination,\nour directors and officers could still be subject to potential liability from claims arising from conduct alleged to have occurred prior\nto the initial business combination. As a result, in order to protect our directors and officers, the post-business combination entity\nmay need to purchase additional insurance with respect to any such claims (\u201crun-off insurance\u201d). The need for run-off insurance\nwould be an added expense for the post-business combination entity, and could interfere with or frustrate our ability to consummate an\ninitial business combination on terms favorable to our investors.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n53\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may be a passive foreign investment company, or \u201cPFIC,\u201d\nwhich could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. investors.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we are a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is\nincluded in the holding period of a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of the prospectus for our IPO captioned \u201cTaxation\u2014United\nStates Federal Income Tax Considerations\u2014General\u201d) of our Class A ordinary shares or warrants, the U.S. Holder may be subject\nto adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences and may be subject to additional reporting requirements. Our PFIC status for our current\nand subsequent taxable years may depend on whether we qualify for the PFIC start-up exception (see the section of the prospectus for our\nIPO captioned \u201cTaxation\u2014United States Federal Income Tax Considerations\u2014U.S. Holders\u2014Passive Foreign Investment\nCompany Rules\u201d). Depending on the particular circumstances, the application of the start-up exception may be subject to uncertainty,\nand there cannot be any assurance that we will qualify for the start-up exception. Accordingly, there can be no assurances with respect\nto our status as a PFIC for our current taxable year or any subsequent taxable year. Our actual PFIC status for any taxable year, however,\nwill not be determinable until after the end of such taxable year. Moreover, if we determine we are a PFIC for any taxable year, upon\nwritten request, we will endeavor to provide to a U.S. Holder such information as the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) may\nrequire, including a PFIC Annual Information Statement, in order to enable the U.S. Holder to make and maintain a \u201cqualified electing\nfund\u201d election, but there can be no assurance that we will timely provide such required information, and such election would be\nunavailable with respect to our warrants in all cases. We urge U.S. investors to consult their tax advisors regarding the possible application\nof the PFIC rules.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAn investment in our securities may result in uncertain or adverse\nU.S. federal income tax consequences.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAn investment in our securities may result in uncertain U.S. federal\nincome tax consequences. For instance, because there are no authorities that directly address instruments similar to our units, the allocation\nan investor makes with respect to the purchase price of a unit between the Class A ordinary shares and the one-sixth of a warrant to purchase\none Class A ordinary share included in each unit could be challenged by the IRS or courts. Furthermore, the U.S. federal income tax consequences\nof a cashless exercise of warrants included in our units is unclear under current law. Finally, it is unclear whether the redemption rights\nwith respect to our ordinary shares suspend the running of a U.S. Holder\u2019s (as defined in the prospectus for our IPO under \u201cTaxation\u2014United\nStates Federal Income Tax Considerations\u2014General\u201d) holding period for purposes of determining whether any gain or loss realized\nby such holder on the sale or exchange of Class A ordinary shares is long-term capital gain or loss and for determining whether any dividend\nwe pay would be considered a \u201cqualified dividend\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See the section the prospectus for\nour IPO entitled \u201cTaxation\u2014United States Federal Income Tax Considerations\u201d for a summary of the U.S. federal income\ntax considerations of an investment in our securities. Prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to these\nand other tax consequences of purchasing, holding or disposing of our securities.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAfter our initial business combination, it is possible that a majority\nof our directors and officers will live outside the United States and all of our assets will be located outside the United States; therefore\ninvestors may not be able to enforce federal securities laws or their other legal rights.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt is possible that after our initial business combination, a majority\nof our directors and officers will reside outside of the United States and all of our assets will be located outside of the United States.\nAs a result, it may be difficult, or in some cases not possible, for investors in the United States to enforce their legal rights, to\neffect service of process upon all of our directors or officers or to enforce judgments of United States courts predicated upon civil\nliabilities and criminal penalties on our directors and officers under United States laws.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBecause we are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands,\nyou may face difficulties in protecting your interests, and your ability to protect your rights through the U.S. federal courts may be\nlimited.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman\nIslands. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon our directors or executive\nofficers, or enforce judgments obtained in the United States courts against our directors or officers.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur corporate affairs will be governed by our amended and restated\nmemorandum and articles of association, the Companies Law (as the same may be supplemented or amended from time to time) and the common\nlaw of the Cayman Islands. We will also be subject to the federal securities laws of the United States. The rights of shareholders to\ntake action against the directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman\nIslands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in\npart from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law, the decisions of whose courts\nare of persuasive authority, but are not binding on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities\nof our directors under Cayman Islands law are different from what they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions\nin the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a different body of securities laws as compared to the United States, and\ncertain states, such as Delaware, may have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law. In addition, Cayman\nIslands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholders derivative action in a Federal court of the United States.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n54\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\nhave been advised by Maples and Calder, our Cayman Islands legal counsel, that the courts of the Cayman Islands are unlikely (i) to recognize\nor enforce against us judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities\nlaws of the United States or any state; and (ii) in original actions brought in the Cayman Islands, to impose liabilities against us\npredicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state, so far as the liabilities\nimposed by those provisions are penal in nature. In those circumstances, although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands\nof judgments obtained in the United States, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce a foreign money judgment of a\nforeign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle that a judgment of a competent foreign court\nimposes upon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided certain conditions are met.\nFor a foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated sum, and\nmust not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a Cayman Islands judgment in respect of the same matter, impeachable\non the grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, or be of a kind the enforcement of which is, contrary to natural justice or the public\npolicy of the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to public policy). A Cayman Islands\nCourt may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs\na result of all of the above, public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken\nby management, members of the board of directors or controlling shareholders than they would as public shareholders of a United States\ncompany.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nChanges\nin laws or regulations or how such laws or regulations are interpreted or applied, or a failure to comply with any laws or regulations,\nmay adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results of operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\nare and will be subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments and, potentially, foreign\njurisdictions. In particular, we will be required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements, our business combination\nmay be contingent on our ability to comply with certain laws and regulations and any post-business combination company may be\nsubject to additional laws and regulations. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult,\ntime consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time,\nincluding as a result of changes in economic, political, social and government policies, and those changes could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results of\noperations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results of\noperations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks\nAssociated with Acquiring and Operating a Business in Foreign Countries\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf\nwe pursue a target company with operations or opportunities outside of the United\u00a0States for our initial business combination, we\nmay face additional burdens in connection with investigating, agreeing to and completing such initial business combination, and if we\neffect such initial business combination, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf\nwe pursue a target a company with operations or opportunities outside of the United\u00a0States for our initial business combination,\nwe would be subject to risks associated with cross-border business combinations, including in connection with investigating, agreeing\nto and completing our initial business combination, conducting due diligence in a foreign jurisdiction, having such transaction approved\nby any local governments, regulators or agencies and changes in the purchase price based on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n55\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf\nwe effect our initial business combination with such a company, we would be subject to any special considerations or risks associated\nwith companies operating in an international setting, including any of the following:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\ncosts\n                                            and difficulties inherent in managing cross-border business operations;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\nrules\n                                            and regulations regarding currency redemption;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\ncomplex\n                                            corporate withholding taxes on individuals;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\nlaws\n                                            governing the manner in which future business combinations may be effected;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\nexchange\n                                            listing and/or delisting requirements;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\ntariffs\n                                            and trade barriers;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\nregulations\n                                            related to customs and import/export matters;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\nlocal\n                                            or regional economic policies and market conditions;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\nunexpected\n                                            changes in regulatory requirements;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\nlonger\n                                            payment cycles;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\ntax\n                                            issues, such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws as compared to the United\u00a0States;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\ncurrency\n                                            fluctuations and exchange controls;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\nrates\n                                            of inflation;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\nchallenges\n                                            in collecting accounts receivable;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\ncultural\n                                            and language differences;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\nemployment\n                                            regulations;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\nunderdeveloped\n                                            or unpredictable legal or regulatory systems;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\ncorruption;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\nprotection\n                                            of intellectual property;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\nsocial\n                                            unrest, crime, strikes, riots and civil disturbances;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\nregime\n                                            changes and political upheaval;\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\nterrorist\n                                            attacks, natural disasters and wars; and\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u27a4\ndeterioration\n                                            of political relations with the United\u00a0States.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\nmay not be able to adequately address these additional risks. If we were unable to do so, we may be unable to complete such initial business\ncombination, or, if we complete such combination, our operations might suffer, either of which may adversely impact our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n56\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf\nour management following our initial business combination is unfamiliar with United\u00a0States securities laws, they may have to expend\ntime and resources becoming familiar with such laws, which could lead to various regulatory issues.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFollowing\nour initial business combination, our management may resign from their positions as officers or directors of the Company and the management\nof the target business at the time of the business combination will remain in place. Management of the target business may not be familiar\nwith United\u00a0States securities laws. If new management is unfamiliar with United\u00a0States securities laws, they may have to expend\ntime and resources becoming familiar with such laws. This could be expensive and time-consuming and could lead to various regulatory\nissues which may adversely affect our operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAfter\nour initial business combination, substantially all of our assets may be located in a foreign country and substantially all of our revenue\nmay be derived from our operations in any such country. Accordingly, our results of operations and prospects will be subject, to a significant\nextent, to the economic, political and social conditions and government policies, developments and conditions in the country in which\nwe operate.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe\neconomic, political and social conditions, as well as government policies, of the country in which our operations are located could affect\nour business. Economic growth could be uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy and such growth may not be\nsustained in the future. If in the future such country\u2019s economy experiences a downturn or grows at a slower rate than expected,\nthere may be less demand for spending in certain industries. A decrease in demand for spending in certain industries could materially\nand adversely affect our ability to find an attractive target business with which to consummate our initial business combination and\nif we effect our initial business combination, the ability of that target business to become profitable.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nExchange\nrate fluctuations and currency policies may cause a target business\u2019 ability to succeed in the international markets to be diminished.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn\nthe event we acquire a non-U.S. target, all revenues and income would likely be received in a foreign currency, and the dollar equivalent\nof our net assets and distributions, if any, could be adversely affected by reductions in the value of the local currency. The value\nof the currencies in our target regions fluctuate and are affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions.\nAny change in the relative value of such currency against our reporting currency may affect the attractiveness of any target business\nor, following consummation of our initial business combination, our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if a\ncurrency appreciates in value against the dollar prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, the cost of a target\nbusiness as measured in dollars will increase, which may make it less likely that we are able to consummate such transaction.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe\nmay reincorporate in another jurisdiction in connection with our initial business combination, and the laws of such jurisdiction may\ngovern some or all of our future material agreements and we may not be able to enforce our legal rights.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn\nconnection with our initial business combination, we may relocate the home jurisdiction of our business from the Cayman Islands to another\njurisdiction. If we determine to do this, the laws of such jurisdiction may govern some or all of our future material agreements. The\nsystem of laws and the enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdiction may not be as certain in implementation and interpretation as\nin the United\u00a0States. The inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under any of our future agreements could result in a significant\nloss of business, business opportunities or capital.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n57\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRecent\nincreases in inflation in the United States and elsewhere could make it more difficult for us to consummate a business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRecent\nincreases in inflation in the United States and elsewhere may be leading to increased price volatility for publicly traded securities,\nincluding ours, and may lead to other national, regional and international economic disruptions, any of which could make it more difficult\nfor us to consummate a business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nConflict\nin Ukraine could make it more difficult for us to consummate a business combination.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nConflict\nin Ukraine may lead to increased price volatility for publicly traded securities, including ours, and to other national, regional and\ninternational economic disruptions, any of which could make it more difficult for us to identify a business combination partner and consummate\na business combination on acceptable commercial terms or at all.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "item7": ">Item 7.\n    \nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n\n59\n\n\n\n\nItem\u00a07A.\n\n\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\n\n65\n\n\n\n", "item7a": ">Item\u00a07A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe\nnet proceeds of our IPO and a portion of the proceeds of our concurrent sale of private placement warrants are held in a trust account\ninvested in U.S. Government Treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions\nunder Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and which invest only in direct U.S. Government Treasury obligations.\nDue to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe there will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk.
