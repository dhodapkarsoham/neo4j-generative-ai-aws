{"item1": ">Item 1. Business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe iShares S&P GSCI\u2122 Commodity-Indexed Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d) is a Delaware statutory trust that issues units of beneficial interest, called \u201cShares,\u201d representing fractional undivided beneficial interests in its net assets. The Trust\u2019s assets consist of long positions in exchange-traded index futures contracts of various expirations (the \u201cIndex Futures\u201d) on the S&P GSCI\u2122 Excess Return Index, (the \u201cS&P GSCI-ER\u201d) together with cash, U.S. Treasury securities or other short-term securities and similar securities that are eligible as margin deposits for those Index Futures positions (the \u201cCollateral Assets\u201d). The Trust seeks to track the results, before expenses and liabilities, of the S&P GSCI Total Return Index (the \u201cIndex\u201d), which represents a diversified, fully collateralized investment in futures contracts.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\niShares Delaware Trust Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, is the sponsor of the Trust (the \u201cSponsor\u201d). BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A., an affiliate of the Sponsor, is the trustee of the Trust (the \u201cTrustee\u201d). The Trust is a commodity pool, as defined in the Commodity Exchange Act (the \u201cCEA\u201d) and the applicable regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d), and is operated by the Sponsor, a commodity pool operator registered with the CFTC. BlackRock Fund Advisors (the \u201cAdvisor\u201d), an indirect subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (\u201cBlackRock\u201d), serves as the commodity trading advisor of the Trust and is registered with the CFTC. The Trust is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d). The Trust has delegated day-to-day administration of the Trust to the Trustee. The Trustee has delegated certain day-to-day administrative functions of the Trustee to State Street Bank and Trust Company (the \u201cTrust Administrator\u201d). Wilmington Trust Company, a Delaware trust company, serves as the Delaware trustee of the Trust (the \u201cDelaware Trustee\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust intends to offer Shares on a continuous basis. The Trust issues and redeems Shares only in one or more blocks of 50,000 Shares (\u201cBaskets\u201d). Only registered brokers-dealers who have entered into an authorized participant agreement with the Trust (each, an \u201cAuthorized Participant\u201d) may purchase or redeem Baskets, in exchange for Index Futures and Collateral Assets with an aggregate value equal to the net asset value per Share\u00a0(\u201cNAV\u201d) of the Shares being purchased or redeemed. Owners of beneficial interest in Shares (\u201cShareholders\u201d) who are not Authorized Participants have no right to redeem their Shares. In order to liquidate their investment in the Shares, Shareholders who are not Authorized Participants must generally sell their Shares in the secondary market, assuming that demand for their Shares exists. The price obtained by the Shareholders for the Shares may be less than the NAV of those Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe activities of the Trust are generally limited to:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nissuing Baskets in exchange for Index Futures and cash (or, in the discretion of the Sponsor, other Collateral Assets)\u037e\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nconsistent with its investment objective, establishing, maintaining and closing out positions in Index Futures and acquiring, holding and disposing of corresponding Collateral Assets\u037e\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \npaying out of its assets any expenses and liabilities of the Trust not assumed by the Sponsor\u037e\u00a0and\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \ndelivering proceeds consisting of Index Futures, cash and other Collateral Assets in exchange for Baskets surrendered for redemption.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust is a passive investor in Index Futures and the Collateral Assets held to satisfy applicable margin requirements on those Index Futures positions. The Advisor acts as the commodity trading advisor for the Trust\u00a0and is authorized to transact in Index Futures\u00a0and acquire and dispose of the related Collateral Assets on the Trust\u2019s behalf. The Trust does not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from, or to ameliorate losses caused by, changes in the level of the Index or the S&P GSCI-ER or the value of the Collateral Assets. To the extent that the Trust accepts cash proceeds in connection with the creation of Shares, the Trust will use that cash to purchase additional Index Futures and Collateral Assets, in an amount that the Advisor determines will enable the Trust to achieve investment results that correspond with the Index. As of the date of this report, the Index Futures held by the Trust are listed for trading by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (the \u201cCME\u201d), which is owned and operated by the CME Group, Inc. Subsequent Index Futures held by the Trust may be listed on other futures exchanges (the CME or any such other futures exchange listing Index Futures, the \u201cExchange\u201d). At any time when Index Futures of more than one expiration are listed on the Exchange, the Sponsor will determine, pursuant to the terms of the trust agreement of the Trust (the \u201cTrust Agreement\u201d), which Index Futures will be transferred in connection with either the creation or redemption of Baskets.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Sponsor maintains a website at www.ishares.com, through which the Trust\u2019s monthly account statements, annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10\u2011Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), can be accessed free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d). Additional information regarding the Trust may also be found on the SEC website at www.sec.gov.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInvestment Objective of the Trust\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust seeks to track the results of a fully collateralized investment in futures contracts on an index composed of a diversified group of commodity futures. The Trust seeks to track the investment returns of the Index before fees and expenses of the Trust. The Trust seeks to achieve its investment objective by holding long positions in Index Futures that have settlement values at expiration based on the level of the S&P GSCI-ER at that time, and earning interest on its non-cash Collateral Assets used to satisfy applicable margin requirements on those Index Futures positions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n    \u00a0\n  \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe S&P GSCI-ER is calculated based on the same commodities that are included in the S&P GSCI\u2122 Commodity Index (the \u201cS&P GSCI\u2122\u201d), which is a production\u2011weighted index of the prices of a diversified group of futures contracts on physical commodities. The S&P GSCI-ER reflects the return of an uncollateralized investment in the contracts comprising the S&P GSCI\u2122, and in addition incorporates the economic effect of rolling the contracts included in the S&P GSCI\u2122 as they near expiration. Rolling a futures contract means closing out a position in an expiring futures contract and establishing an equivalent position in a replacement futures contract on the same commodity.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Index, in turn, reflects the return of the S&P GSCI-ER, together with the return on specified U.S. Treasury securities that are deemed to have been held to collateralize a hypothetical long position in the futures contracts comprising the S&P GSCI\u2122. If the index sponsor, which is S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the \u201cIndex Sponsor\u201d), ceases to maintain the Index, the Trust may seek investment results that correspond generally, but are not necessarily identical, to the performance of a fully collateralized investment in a successor index or any other index that, in the opinion of the Sponsor, is reasonably similar to the Index.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhen establishing positions in Index Futures, the Advisor estimates as of the date of this report that the Trust will be required to deposit initial margin with a value of approximately 3% to 10% of the value of each Index Futures position at the time it is established. These margin requirements are subject to change from time to time by the Exchange or Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (\u201cGoldman Sachs\u201d), the clearing futures commission merchant (the \u201cClearing FCM\u201d). Margin requirements established by the Clearing FCM may exceed minimum levels established by the Exchange. On a daily basis, the Trust is obligated to pay, or entitled to receive, variation margin in an amount equal to the change in the daily settlement level of its Index Futures positions. If the daily settlement level causes the value of the Trust\u2019s Index Futures positions to decrease, the Trust is required to post variation margin with the Clearing FCM. Conversely, if the daily settlement level causes the value of the Trust\u2019s Index Futures positions to increase, the Trust\u2019s account with the Clearing FCM receives variation margin in an amount equal to the increase.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhenever Index Futures of different types or expirations are available for investment, the Sponsor determines, pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, which Index Futures are to be transferred in connection with either the creation or redemption of Baskets. The Trust does not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from, or to ameliorate losses caused by, changes in the level of the Index or the S&P GSCI-ER or the value of the Collateral Assets.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe profit or loss on the Trust\u2019s Index Futures positions should correlate with increases and decreases in the value of the S&P GSCI-ER, although this correlation is not expected to be exact. The return on the Index Futures, together with interest on the non-cash Collateral Assets, is expected to result in a total return that corresponds generally, but is not identical, to the Index. Differences between the returns on the Shares and the performance of the Index may be based on, among other factors, differences between the return on the Collateral Assets and the U.S. Treasury rate used to calculate the U.S. Treasury return component of the Index, timing differences, differences between the portion of the Trust\u2019s assets invested in Index Futures versus the portion of the return of the Index contributed by the S&P GSCI-ER, differences between the settlement price of Index Futures and the closing level of the S&P GSCI-ER and the payment of expenses and liabilities by the Trust.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Advisor acts as the commodity trading advisor for the Trust. The Advisor, on behalf of the Trust, is authorized to invest all of the Trust\u2019s assets in long positions in Index Futures and in Collateral Assets in order to satisfy applicable margin requirements on those Index Futures positions. Any cash that the Trust accepts in connection with the creation of Shares is used to purchase additional Index Futures or Collateral Assets in an amount that the Advisor determines will enable the Trust to achieve investment results that correspond with the Index, before the payment of the Trust\u2019s expenses and liabilities. The Advisor does not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from, or to ameliorate losses caused by, changes in the level of the Index or the S&P GSCI-ER or the value of the Collateral Assets.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDue to creation or redemption activity or expenses incurred in the Trust, the notional value of Index Futures held may, at times, exceed the aggregate value of the Trust\u2019s assets. In such instances the Advisor may elect, in such a manner as the Advisor determines will enable the Trust to achieve investment results that correspond to the Index before the payment of the Trust\u2019s expenses and liabilities, to dispose of Index Futures to reduce the Trust\u2019s notional exposure to Index Futures or continue to hold Index Futures in a notional amount that exceeds the aggregate value of the Trust\u2019s assets until additional creation or redemption activity or trading aligns the notional value of the Index Futures with the corresponding collateral holdings.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Shares are intended to constitute an alternative means for investors to achieve investment exposure to the performance of the Index. Although the Shares are not the exact equivalent of an investment in the underlying futures contracts and U.S. Treasury securities represented by the Index, the Shares are intended to provide investors with an alternative method of participating in the commodities market. In addition, retail investors can gain exposure to the commodities underlying the S&P GSCI-ER by purchasing individual or small lots of Shares through traditional brokerage accounts, without being subject to the significantly higher minimum contract sizes required for directly establishing a position in the underlying commodities or futures contracts. The Shares are eligible for margin accounts.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSecondary Market Trading\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhile the Trust anticipates that the price of the Shares will fluctuate in a manner that reflects changes in the Trust\u2019s net asset value over time, at any given time the Shares may trade at, above or below the NAV. The NAV fluctuates primarily with changes in the market value of Index Futures. The NAV may also be affected as a result of fluctuations in the value of Collateral Assets, but this fluctuation is not expected to be significant because the Collateral Assets are expected to consist of cash and U.S. Treasury securities. The trading price of the Shares fluctuates in accordance with changes in the NAV, intraday changes in the value of the Index Futures and market supply and demand. The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the NAV may be influenced by non-concurrent trading hours between NYSE Arca, Inc. (\u201cNYSE Arca\u201d), the exchange on which the Shares trade, the Exchanges on which Index Futures trade and the principal commodities markets on which the futures contracts in the S&P GSCI-ER trade. While the Shares are expected to trade on NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. (New York time), liquidity in the markets for the Index Futures and the futures contracts underlying the S&P GSCI-ER is expected to be reduced whenever the principal markets for these contracts are closed. As a result, trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount on the Shares, may widen during these gaps in market trading hours.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nValuation of Index Futures\n\u037e\n Computation of the Trust\n\u2019\ns Net Asset Value\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Sponsor has the exclusive authority to determine the net asset value of the Trust and the NAV, which it has delegated to the Trustee under the Trust Agreement. The Trustee determines the net asset value of the Trust and the NAV as of 4:00 p.m. (New York time), on each Business Day on which NYSE Arca is open for regular trading, as soon as practicable after that time. A Business Day is a day (1) on which none of the following occurs: (a) NYSE Arca is closed for regular trading, (b) the Exchange is closed for regular trading or (c) the Federal Reserve wire transfer system is closed for cash wire transfers, or (2) that the Trustee determines that it is able to conduct business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trustee values the Trust\u2019s long positions in Index Futures on the basis of that day\u2019s settlement prices for the Index Futures held by the Trust as announced by the applicable Exchange. The value of the Trust\u2019s positions in any particular Index Futures contract equals the product of (1) the number of such Index Futures contracts owned by the Trust, (2) the settlement price of such Index Futures contract on the date of calculation and (3) the multiplier of such Index Futures contract. If there is no announced settlement price for a particular Index Futures contract on a Business Day, the Trustee uses the most recently announced settlement price unless the Trustee, in consultation with the Sponsor, determines that such price is inappropriate as a basis for valuation. The daily settlement price for each Index Futures contract currently held by the Trust is established on each trading day, generally at 2:40 p.m. (New York time), by the CME Group Inc., and its designed contract markets, including the CME, CBOT (Board of Trade of the City of Chicago, Inc.), NYMEX (New York Mercantile Exchange), COMEX and KCBT (the \u201cCME Group\u201d) staff.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trustee values all other holdings of the Trust at (1) its current market value, if quotations for such property are readily available or (2) its fair value, as reasonably determined by the Trustee, if the current market value cannot be determined.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOnce the value of the Index Futures, Collateral Assets of the Trust and interest earned on the Trust\u2019s Collateral Assets has been determined, the Trustee subtracts all accrued expenses and liabilities of the Trust as of the time of calculation in order to calculate the net asset value of the Trust.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOnce the net asset value of the Trust has been calculated, the Trustee determines the NAV by dividing the net asset value of the Trust by the number of Shares outstanding at the time the calculation is made. Any changes to the NAV that may result from creation and redemption activity occurring on any Business Day are\u00a0not reflected in the NAV until the following Business Day.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe NAV for each Business Day on which NYSE Arca is open for regular trading is expected to be distributed through major market data vendors and published online at www.ishares.com or any successor thereto. The Trust updates the NAV as soon as practicable after each subsequent NAV is calculated.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTrust Expenses\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Sponsor has agreed under the Trust Agreement to pay the following administrative, operational and marketing expenses:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nthe fees of the Trustee, the Delaware Trustee, the Advisor, the Trust Administrator, the processing agent and their respective agents\u037e\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nNYSE Arca listing fees\u037e\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nprinting and mailing costs\u037e\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \naudit fees\u037e\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nfees for registration of the Shares with the SEC\u037e\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \ntax reporting costs\u037e\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nlicense fees\u037e\u00a0and\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nlegal expenses relating to the Trust of up to $100,000 annually.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust is not expected to have other ordinary recurring administrative, operational or marketing expenses other than brokerage commissions and similar transaction fees, as described below.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn return for paying the expenses described above, the Sponsor receives a fee which accrues daily at an annualized rate of up to 0.75% of the net asset value of the Trust, as calculated before deducting fees and expenses based on the value of the Trust\u2019s assets (the \u201cAdjusted Net Asset Value\u201d), is payable by the Trust monthly in arrears, and is subject to adjustment from time to time (the \u201cSponsor\u2019s Fee\u201d), except that the Sponsor\u2019s Fee may not be adjusted to above 0.75% of the Adjusted Net Asset Value absent an amendment of the Trust Agreement with thirty day\u2019s prior notice to registered holders of the Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Sponsor and the Trustee may amend or terminate the Sponsor\u2019s obligation to pay certain expenses of the Trust pursuant to the Trust Agreement.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust is responsible for paying any applicable brokerage commissions and similar transaction fees out of its assets.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe following expenses are paid out of the assets of the Trust:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nany expenses of the Trust (including the Sponsor\u2019s Fee) that are not assumed by the Sponsor\u037e\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nany taxes and other governmental charges that may fall on the Trust or its property\u037e\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nany expenses of any extraordinary services performed by the Trustee or the Sponsor on behalf of the Trust or expense of any action taken by the Trustee or the Sponsor to protect the Trust and the rights and interests of holders of the Shares\u037e\u00a0and\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nany indemnification of the Sponsor, the Advisor or other agents, service providers or counterparties of the Trust.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trustee is also entitled to charge the Trust for all expenses and disbursements incurred by the Trustee in connection with the actions described in the second and third bullet points above, including fees and disbursements of its legal counsel\u037e provided that the Trustee is not entitled to charge the Trust for (1) expenses and disbursements that were incurred by it before the Shares were publicly traded and (2) fees of agents for performing services that the Trustee is required under the Trust Agreement to perform.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trustee, at the direction of the Sponsor, may liquidate the Trust\u2019s property from time to time as necessary to permit payment of the fees and expenses that the Trust is required to pay. The Trustee is not responsible for any depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the liquidation of Trust property made in compliance with the Trust Agreement.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCreations of Baskets\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust intends to offer Shares on a continuous basis on each Business Day, but issuances of new Shares may be suspended at any time. Shares may be offered only in Baskets of 50,000 Shares. Baskets are typically issued only in exchange for an amount of Index Futures and cash (or, in the discretion of the Sponsor, other Collateral Assets) (the \u201cBasket Amount\u201d) for the Business Day on which the creation order was received by the Trustee. The Basket Amount for a Business Day has a per Share value equal to the NAV as of such day, and the assets included in the Basket Amount are valued in the same manner and on the same basis as the NAV calculations for the Trust\u2019s assets. Creation orders received after 2:40 p.m. (New York time) are not deemed to be received until the following Business Day. In limited circumstances and subject to the approval of the Trustee, Baskets may be created for cash equal to the NAV of the Shares constituting a Basket as determined on the date the related creation order was received, plus the costs incurred by the Trust in establishing the corresponding Index Futures positions and acquiring the related Collateral Assets. Creation orders for Baskets paid for solely in cash that are received after 10:00 a.m. (New York time) will be deemed received as of the following Business Day. The Trustee notifies the Authorized Participants of the Basket Amount on each Business Day.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBefore the Trust issues any Baskets to an Authorized Participant, that Authorized Participant must deliver to the Trustee a creation order indicating the number of Baskets it intends to purchase and providing other details with respect to the procedures by which the Baskets are to be transferred. The Trustee expects to acknowledge the creation order unless it or the Sponsor decides to refuse the order.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUpon the transfer of (1) the required consideration of Index Futures in the amounts and of the type specified by the Trustee and cash (or, in the discretion of the Sponsor, other Collateral Assets) in the amounts specified by the Trustee, in each case to the accounts specified by the Trustee, and (2) all transaction fees associated with creations (including but not limited to fees charged by the Exchange and the Clearing FCM) per Basket, the Trustee will deliver the appropriate number of Baskets to the Depository Trust Company (\u201cDTC\u201d) account of the Authorized Participant. The total transaction fees charged per Basket created may change from time to time.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOnly Authorized Participants can transfer the required consideration and receive Baskets in exchange. Authorized Participants may act for their own accounts or as agents for broker-dealers, custodians and other securities market participants that wish to create or redeem Baskets. An Authorized Participant is under no obligation to the Trust to create or redeem Baskets for itself or on behalf of other persons. An order for one or more Baskets may be placed by an Authorized Participant on behalf of multiple clients. As of the date of this report, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., SG Americas Securities, LLC and UBS Securities LLC are the only Authorized Participants. The Sponsor and the Trustee maintain a current list of Authorized Participants.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNo Shares are issued unless and until the Trustee receives confirmation that the required consideration has been received in the account or accounts specified by the Trustee. It is expected that delivery of the Shares will be made against transfer of consideration on the next Business Day following the Business Day on which the creation order is received by the Trustee, which is referred to as a T+1 settlement cycle. If the Trustee has not received the required consideration for the Shares to be delivered on the delivery date, by 11:00 a.m. (New York time), the Trustee may cancel the creation order.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trustee has the right to reject any creation order for any reason. The reasons for the rejection may include, among others, (1) the related order not being in proper form as described in the Authorized Participant agreement, (2) market conditions or other circumstances that make transactions in or delivery of the Shares or the Index Futures impossible or impractical, (3) a determination by the Trustee that the acceptance of the related order would have adverse tax or other consequences to the Trust or the Shareholders, or (4) circumstances that would cause the acceptance of the related order to result in a violation of law in the opinion of counsel to the Trustee, the Sponsor or the Trust Administrator. Each Authorized Participant agreement provides that neither the Trustee nor any agents acting on its behalf will be liable to any person for rejecting a creation order.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRedemptions of Baskets\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAuthorized Participants may typically surrender Baskets in exchange only for an amount of Index Futures and cash (or, in the discretion of the Sponsor, other Collateral Assets) equal to the value of the Basket Amount on the Business Day the redemption request is received by the Trustee. Redemption orders received after 2:40 p.m. (New York time) are not deemed to be received until the following Business Day. Holders of Baskets who are not Authorized Participants are not able to redeem their Baskets except through an Authorized Participant. It is expected that Authorized Participants may redeem Baskets for their own accounts or on behalf of Shareholders who are not Authorized Participants, but no Authorized Participant is under any obligation to the Trust to do so.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBefore surrendering Baskets for redemption, an Authorized Participant must deliver to the Trustee a request indicating the number of Baskets it intends to redeem and providing other details with respect to the procedures by which the assets representing the required Basket Amount are to be transferred. The Trustee expects to acknowledge the redemption order unless it or the Sponsor decides to refuse the redemption order.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAfter the delivery by the Authorized Participant to the Trust\u2019s DTC account of the total number of Shares to be redeemed by an Authorized Participant, the Trustee delivers to the order of the redeeming Authorized Participant redemption proceeds consisting of Index Futures and cash (or, in the discretion of the Sponsor, other Collateral Assets). The assets included in the redemption proceeds are valued in the same manner and on the same basis as the\u00a0NAV calculations for the Trust\u2019s assets. In connection with a redemption order, the redeeming Authorized Participant authorizes the Trustee to deduct from the proceeds of redemption any and all transaction fees associated with redemptions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt is expected that delivery of the Index Futures and cash or other Collateral Assets to the redeeming Shareholder will be made against transfer of the Baskets on the next Business Day following the Business Day on which the redemption request is received by the Trustee, which is referred to as a T+1 settlement cycle. If the Trustee\u2019s DTC account has not been credited with the total number of Shares to be redeemed pursuant to the redemption order by 11:00 a.m. (New York time), on the delivery date, the Trustee may cancel the redemption order.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trustee has the right to reject any redemption order for any reason. The reasons for the rejection may include, among others, (1) the related order not being in proper form as described in the Authorized Participant agreement, (2) market conditions or other circumstances that make transactions in or delivery of the Shares or the Index Futures impossible or impractical, (3) a determination by the Trustee that the acceptance of the related order would have adverse tax or other consequences to the Trust or the Shareholders, or (4) circumstances that would cause the acceptance of the related order to result in a violation of law in the opinion of counsel to the Trustee, the Sponsor or the Trust Administrator. Each Authorized Participant agreement provides that neither the Trustee nor any agents acting on its behalf will be liable to any person for rejecting a redemption order.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCustody of the Trust Assets\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust\u2019s Index Futures and the Collateral Assets posted as margin for these Index Futures positions are held in the Trust\u2019s account, established at its Clearing FCM. The Clearing FCM further transfers some or all of the Collateral Assets posted as margin for the Trust\u2019s Index Futures positions to the clearing house of the Exchange.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSubstantially all of the Trust\u2019s remaining assets are held in the Trust\u2019s accounts at the Trust Administrator.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       5\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFutures Contracts on the S&P GSCI-ER\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe assets of the Trust consist of Index Futures and cash or other Collateral Assets used to satisfy applicable margin requirements for those Index Futures positions. Index Futures are exchange-traded index futures contracts on the S&P GSCI-ER, and may include contracts of different terms and expirations. The Trust is expected to roll out of existing positions in Index Futures and establish new positions in Index Futures on an ongoing basis. Index Futures subsequently acquired by the Trust may have terms that differ from those of the Index Futures it currently holds, including transaction fees associated with the purchase and sale of these Index Futures.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCreation and redemption of interests in the Trust are generally effected through exchanges for related positions (\u201cEFRPs\u201d). EFRPs involve contemporaneous transactions in futures contracts and the underlying cash commodity or a closely related commodity. In a typical EFRP, the participant taking the long position on the futures contract transfers the underlying commodity or other related position to the participant taking the short position on the futures contract. The CME, the Exchange on which Index Futures trade, permits the execution of EFRPs consisting of simultaneous transfers of Index Futures and Shares. This mechanism generally is expected to be used by the Trust in connection with the creation and redemption of Baskets. Specifically, it is anticipated that an Authorized Participant requesting the creation of additional Baskets typically will transfer Index Futures and cash (or, in the discretion of the Sponsor, other Collateral Assets) to the Trust in return for Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf an EFRP is executed in connection with the redemption of one or more Baskets, an Authorized Participant transfers to the Trust the Shares being redeemed and the Trust transfers to the Authorized Participant Index Futures and cash or other Collateral Assets. The Trust may include Index Futures with different terms and expirations in the creation and redemption of Baskets, and the Index Futures included in creation Baskets may differ from those included in redemption Baskets.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWith the approval of the Sponsor, Baskets may also be created or redeemed for cash, in which case the Authorized Participant will be responsible for the costs incurred by the Trust in establishing or liquidating the corresponding Index Futures position and acquiring or disposing of the related Collateral Assets.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIndex Futures are traded on the CME. Futures contracts and options on futures contracts on the S&P GSCI\u2122, a benchmark index which does not reflect the rolling methodology embedded in the S&P GSCI-ER, have been traded on the CME since 1992. Index Futures are listed and traded separately from the S&P GSCI\u2122 futures contracts and options on futures contracts.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       6\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe first Index Futures were commodity excess return futures contracts on the S&P GSCI-ER, or \u201cCERFs,\u201d that were first listed and made available for trading on March 13, 2006. Until October 2010, these CERFs, which expired in March 2011, were the only Index Futures listed. In October 2010, the CME listed a second CERF, scheduled to expire in March 2014. In January 2014, the CME changed the listing cycle of Index Futures to include the nearest four months as contract months at any given point in time. The CME may at any time expand the listing cycle of Index Futures to include additional expiration dates, and may from time to time amend the rules applicable to the Index Futures. On April 8, 2013, the CME amended the rules applicable to the Index Futures then held by the Trust (through the iShares S&P GSCI\u2122 Commodity-Indexed Investing Pool LLC (the \u201cInvesting Pool\u201d), its now-dissolved subsidiary). In connection with these amendments, the Investing Pool recognized gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on each of its Index Futures positions, depending on the price at which each such position was established.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIndex Futures are subject to the rules of the CME. Index Futures trade on GLOBEX, the CME\u2019s electronic trading system, and do not trade through open outcry on the floor of the CME. Transactions in Index Futures are cleared through the CME\u2019s clearing house by the trader\u2019s Futures Commission Merchant (\u201cFCM\u201d) acting as its agent. Under these clearing arrangements, the CME\u2019s clearing house becomes the buyer to each member FCM representing a seller of the contract and the seller to each member futures commission merchant representing a buyer of the contract. As a result of these clearing arrangements, each trader holding a position in Index Futures is subject to the credit risk of the CME\u2019s clearing house and the FCM carrying its position in Index Futures.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEach Index Futures contract provides for cash settlement, at expiration, based upon the final settlement value of the S&P GSCI-ER at the expiration of the contract, multiplied by a fixed dollar multiplier. The final settlement value of an Index Futures contract is determined on the eleventh business day of the month in which it is scheduled to expire or, if the S&P GSCI-ER is not scheduled to be published for that day, on the first preceding day for which the futures price index is scheduled to be published. On a daily basis, market participants with positions in Index Futures, including the Trust, are obligated to pay, or entitled to receive, cash (known as \u201cvariation margin\u201d) in an amount equal to the change in the daily settlement level of the Index Futures from the preceding trading day\u2019s settlement level (or, initially, the contract price at which the position was entered into). Specifically, if the daily settlement price of the contract increases over the previous day\u2019s price, the seller of the contract must pay the difference to the buyer, and if the daily settlement price is less than the previous day\u2019s price, the buyer of the contract must pay the difference to the seller.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIndex Futures are expected to require deposits of initial margin as well as payments of daily variation margin as the value of the contracts fluctuate. When establishing positions in Index Futures, the Advisor estimates as of the date of this report that the Trust will be required to deposit initial margin with a value of approximately 3% to 10% of the value of each Index Futures position. These margin requirements are subject to change from time to time by the Exchange or the Clearing FCM.\u00a0Upon liquidation or settlement of Index Futures, a market participant is expected to receive from its FCM its initial margin deposit, adjusted for variation margin paid or received by such participant with respect to the contract during the time it was held by the participant (or the proceeds from liquidation of any investments made with such funds for the benefit of the participant under the terms of its custody arrangement with the carrying FCM).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Index and the S&P GSCI-ER\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAll information regarding the Index and the S&P GSCI-ER contained in this report, including its composition, method of calculation, changes in their constituent components and historical performance, has been derived from publicly available information, including information published by the Index Sponsor, but has not been independently verified.

Prior to their acquisition by S&P, the S&P GSCI\u2122 was known as the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index, the S&P GSCI-ER was known as the GSCI\n\u00ae\nExcess Return Index and the Index was known as the GSCI\n\u00ae\nTotal Return Index.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust and the Shares are not sponsored, endorsed, sold or promoted by the Index Sponsor.

The Index Sponsor owns the copyright and other rights to the Index and the S&P GSCI-ER. The Index Sponsor has no obligation to consider your interests as a Shareholder and has no obligation to continue to publish, and may discontinue the publication of, the Index or the S&P GSCI-ER.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCurrent information regarding the market values of the Index and the S&P GSCI-ER is available from the Index Sponsor and numerous public sources. None of the Sponsor, the Trustee, the Delaware Trustee, the Advisor or the Trust makes any representation that publicly available information about the Index and the S&P GSCI-ER is accurate or complete. In addition, none of the Sponsor, the Trustee, the Delaware Trustee, the Advisor or the Trust accepts any responsibility for the calculation, maintenance or publication of, or for any error, omission or disruption in, the Index or the S&P GSCI-ER. The consequences of the Index Sponsor\u2019s discontinuing the S&P GSCI-ER are described under \u201cRisk Factors - Risk Factors Relating to Index Futures and the S&P GSCI-ER.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Index and the S&P GSCI-ER were established in May 1991. The Index reflects the value of an investment in the S&P GSCI-ER together with a Treasury bill return. The S&P GSCI-ER reflects the returns that are potentially available through a rolling uncollateralized investment in the contracts comprising the S&P GSCI\u2122.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFutures contracts have scheduled expirations, or delivery months, and as one contract nears expiration it becomes necessary to close out the position in that delivery month and establish a position in the next available delivery month. This process is referred to as \u201crolling\u201d the position forward. The S&P GSCI\u2011ER is designed to reflect the return from rolling each contract included in the S&P GSCI\u2122 as it nears expiration into the next available delivery month. This is accomplished by selling the position in the first delivery month and purchasing a position of equivalent value in the second delivery month. If the price of the second contract is lower than the price of the first contract, the rolling process results in a greater quantity of the second contract being acquired for the same value. Conversely, if the price of the second contract is higher than the price of the first contract, the rolling process results in a smaller quantity of the second contract being acquired for the same value.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMore specifically, the rolling of the contracts included in the S&P GSCI\u2122 occurs on the fifth through the ninth business days of each month. During this roll period, each contract is shifted from the contract with the nearest expiration to the contract with the next nearest expiration at a rate of 20% per day for each of the five days of the roll period. Therefore, during the first four business days of a month, and just before the end of the fifth business day, the S&P GSCI\u2122 consists of futures contracts with the nearest expirations. The S&P GSCI\u2122 is calculated as though each contract roll occurs at the end of each day during the roll period, at the daily settlement prices. At the end of the fifth business day, the S&P GSCI\u2122 is adjusted so that 20% of the contracts underlying the S&P GSCI\u2122 held are in the next nearest expiring contracts, with 80% remaining in the nearest expiring contracts. The roll process continues on the sixth, seventh and eighth business days, with the relative weights of the nearest to the next nearest expirations gradually shifting from a 60%/40% weighting, to a 40%/60% weighting, to a 20%/80% weighting. At the end of the ninth business day, the last of the contracts with the nearest expirations are exchanged, completing the roll and leaving the S&P GSCI\u2122 composed entirely of contracts with the next nearest expirations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Index Sponsor may from time to time determine that market conditions warrant adjustment of the normal parameters of the roll, including without limitation when the roll occurs, the length of the roll, the proportions of the roll, or the roll-in contract. If there are no viable designated contracts to roll into, the Index Sponsor will determine the appropriate course of action, which may include, but not be limited to, the removal of the commodity from any impacted index.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe S&P GSCI\u2122 itself is an index on a production-weighted basket of principal physical commodities that satisfy specified criteria. The S&P GSCI\u2122 reflects the level of commodity prices at a given time and is designed to be a measure of the performance over time of the markets for these commodities. The commodities represented in the S&P GSCI\u2122 are those physical commodities on which active and liquid contracts are traded on trading facilities in major industrialized countries. The commodities included in the S&P GSCI\u2122 are weighted, on a production basis, to reflect the relative significance (in the view of the Index Sponsor) of those commodities to the world economy. The fluctuations in the level of the S&P GSCI\u2122 are intended generally to correlate with changes in the prices of those physical commodities in global markets. The value of the S&P GSCI\u2122 has been normalized such that its hypothetical level on January 2, 1970 was 100.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe following is a summary of the composition of and the methodology used to calculate the S&P GSCI\u2122 as of the date of this report. The methodology for determining the composition and weighting of the S&P GSCI\u2122 and for calculating its value is subject to modification in a manner consistent with the purposes of the S&P GSCI\u2122, as described below. The Index Sponsor makes the official calculations of the value of the S&P GSCI\u2122. At present, this calculation is performed continuously and is reported on Reuters Page .SPGSCI and on Bloomberg page SPGSCI <index> and is updated at least once every three minutes during business hours on each day on which the S&P GSCI\u2122 is calculated, referred to as an \u201cS&P GSCI\u2122 Business Day.\u201d The settlement price for the S&P GSCI-ER is reported on Reuters Page .SPGSCIP and on Bloomberg page SPGSCIP <index> at the end of each S&P GSCI\u2122 Business Day. If Reuters ceases to publish the value of the S&P GSCI\u2122 or the settlement price of the S&P GSCI-ER, the Index Sponsor has undertaken to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that a comparable reporting service publishes the value of the S&P GSCI\u2122 and the settlement price of the S&P GSCI-ER so long as any Shares are outstanding.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn light of the rapid development of electronic trading platforms and the potential for significant shifts in liquidity between traditional exchanges and those platforms, the Index Sponsor may review both the procedures and criteria for determining the contracts to be included in the S&P GSCI\u2122, as well as the procedures and criteria for evaluating available liquidity on an intra-year basis in order to provide S&P GSCI\u2122 market participants with efficient access to new sources of liquidity and the potential for more efficient trading. In particular, the Index Sponsor may examine the conditions under which an instrument traded on an electronic platform, rather than a traditional futures contract traded on a traditional futures exchange, should be permitted to be included in the S&P GSCI\u2122 and how the composition of the S&P GSCI\u2122 should respond to rapid shifts in liquidity between those instruments and contracts currently included in the S&P GSCI\u2122.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       8\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Index Committee and Commodity Index Advisory Panel\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Index Sponsor has established an index committee to oversee the daily management and operations of the S&P GSCI\u2122 (the \u201cIndex Committee\u201d), and is responsible for all analytical methods and calculation in the indices. The Index Committee is composed of full-time professional members of the Index Sponsor\u2019s staff. At each meeting, the Index Committee reviews any issues that may affect index constituents, statistics comparing the composition of the indices to the market, commodities that are being considered as candidates for addition to an index, and any significant market events. In addition, the Index Committee may revise index policy covering rules for selecting commodities or other matters.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Index Sponsor considers information about changes to its indices and related matters to be potentially market moving and material. Therefore, all Index Committee discussions are confidential.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGenerally, all references in this report to any methodology-related decisions made by the Index Sponsor represent decisions made by the Index Committee. The Index Committee has indicated that it may also make exceptions when applying the index methodology and rules described in its published materials, as summarized in this report.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition to the daily governance of indices and maintenance of index methodologies, at least once within any 12-month period, the Index Committee reviews the methodology to ensure the indices continue to achieve the stated objectives, and that the data and methodology remain effective. In certain instances, the Index Sponsor may publish a consultation inviting comments from external parties.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition to the Index Committee, the Index Sponsor has established a commodity indexed advisory panel to assist it with the operation of the S&P GSCI\u2122 (the \u201cCommodity Index Advisory Panel\u201d). The Commodity Index Advisory Panel meets on an annual basis and at other times at the request of the Index Committee. The principal purpose of the Commodity Index Advisory Panel is to advise the Index Committee with respect to, among other things, the calculation of the S&P GSCI\u2122, the effectiveness of the S&P GSCI\u2122 as a measure of commodity futures market performance and the need for changes in the composition or the methodology of the S&P GSCI\u2122. The Commodity Index Advisory Panel acts solely in an advisory and consultative capacity. The Index Committee makes all decisions with respect to the composition, calculation and operation of the S&P GSCI\u2122. Certain of the members of the Commodity Index Advisory Panel may be affiliated with clients of S&P. Also, certain of the members of the Commodity Index Advisory Panel may be affiliated with entities which, from time to time, may have investments linked to the S&P GSCI\u2122, either through transactions in the contracts included in the S&P GSCI\u2122, futures contracts on the S&P GSCI\u2122 or derivative products linked to the S&P GSCI\u2122.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nComposition of the S&P GSCI\n\u2122\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCurrently, in order to be included in the S&P GSCI\u2122, a contract must be on a physical commodity and may not be on a financial commodity (e.g., securities, currencies, interest rates, etc.). The contracts on a particular commodity need not require physical delivery by their terms in order for the commodity to be considered a physical commodity.

Used with permission.\n\n\n(b)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \nTickers are Reuters RIC Codes.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe quantity of each of the contracts included in the S&P GSCI\u2122 is determined on the basis of a five-year average, referred to as the \u201cworld production average,\u201d of the production quantity of the underlying commodity as published by sources determined by the Index Sponsor to be reasonably accurate and reliable. However, if a commodity is primarily a regional commodity, based on its production, use, pricing, transportation or other factors, the Index Sponsor\u00a0may calculate the weight of that commodity based on regional, rather than world, production data. At present, natural gas is the only commodity the weights of which are calculated on the basis of regional production data, with the relevant region defined as North America.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe five-year moving average is updated annually for each commodity included in the S&P GSCI\u2122, based on the most recent five-year period for which complete data for all commodities is available. The data is generally reported on a two-year lag. The CPWs used in calculating the S&P GSCI\u2122 are derived from world or regional production averages, as applicable, of the relevant commodities, and are calculated based on the total quantity traded for the relevant contract and the world or regional production average, as applicable, of the underlying commodity. However, if the volume of trading in the relevant contract, as a multiple of the production levels of the commodity, is below specified thresholds, the CPW of the contract is reduced until the threshold is satisfied.\n\n\nThis is designed to ensure that trading in each contract is sufficiently liquid relative to the production of the commodity.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, the Index Sponsor performs this calculation on a monthly basis and, if the multiple of any contract is below the prescribed threshold, the composition of the S&P GSCI\u2122 is reevaluated, based on the criteria and weighting procedure described above. This procedure is undertaken to allow the S&P GSCI\u2122 to shift from contracts that have lost substantial liquidity into more liquid contracts during the course of a given year. As a result, it is possible that the composition or weighting of the S&P GSCI\u2122 will change on one or more of these monthly evaluation dates. The likely circumstances under which the Index Sponsor would be expected to change the composition of the Index during a given year, however, are (1) a substantial shift of liquidity away from a contract included in the Index as described above, or (2) an emergency, such as a natural disaster or act of war or terrorism, that causes trading in a particular contract to cease permanently or for an extended period of time. In either event, the Index Sponsor is expected to publish the nature of the changes, through websites, news media or other outlets, with as much prior notice to market participants as is reasonably practicable. Moreover, regardless of whether any changes have occurred during the year, the Index Sponsor reevaluates the composition of the S&P GSCI\u2122 at the conclusion of each year, based on the above criteria. Other commodities that satisfy that criteria, if any, are expected to be added to the S&P GSCI\u2122. Commodities included in the S&P GSCI\u2122 that no longer satisfy that criteria, if any, are expected to be deleted.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       11\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nContract Expirations\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe S&P GSCI\u2122 is composed of actively traded contracts with scheduled expirations and it can be calculated only by reference to the prices of contracts for specified expiration, delivery or settlement periods (the \u201cContract Expirations\u201d). The Contract Expirations included in the S&P GSCI\u2122 for each commodity during a given year are designated by the Index Sponsor, in consultation with the Index Committee, provided that each contract must be an \u201cActive Contract.\u201d An \u201cActive Contract\u201d for this purpose is a liquid, actively-traded contract with respect to a particular contract included in the S&P GSCI\u2122 and contract expiration, as defined or identified by the relevant trading facility or, if no such definition or identification is provided by the relevant trading facility, as defined by standard custom and practice in the industry.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf a trading facility deletes one or more Contract Expirations, the S&P GSCI\u2122 is calculated during the remainder of the year in which that deletion occurs on the basis of the remaining Contract Expirations designated by the Index Sponsor. If a trading facility ceases trading in all Contract Expirations relating to a particular contract, the Index Sponsor may designate a replacement contract on the commodity. The replacement contract must satisfy the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the S&P GSCI\u2122. To the extent practicable, the replacement is expected to be effected during the next monthly review of the composition of the S&P GSCI\u2122. If that timing is not practicable, the Index Sponsor is expected to determine the date of the replacement based on a number of factors, including the differences between the existing contract and the replacement contract with respect to contractual specifications and Contract Expirations. In addition, in certain circumstances where two consecutive Contract Expirations for a commodity have not been made available for trading on or through the relevant trading facility, the Index Sponsor may determine to take action in response, including deleting the related Contract Expiration or such commodity from the S&P GSCI.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe deletion of a Contract Expiration, designation of a replacement contract, or the elimination of a commodity from the Index because of the absence of a replacement contract\u00a0could affect the value of the Index and the S&P GSCI-ER, and the effect of any such changes is uncertain.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTotal Dollar Weight of the S&P GSCI\n\u2122\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe total dollar weight of the S&P GSCI\u2122 is the sum of the dollar weights of each of the underlying commodities. The dollar weight of each such commodity on any given day is equal to:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nthe daily contract reference price\u037e\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nmultiplied by the appropriate CPW\u037e\u00a0and\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nduring a roll period, the appropriate \u201croll weights\u201d\u00a0(discussed below).\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe daily contract reference price used in calculating the dollar weight of each commodity on any given day is the most recent daily contract reference price made available by the relevant trading facility, except that the daily contract reference price for the most recent prior day is used if the exchange is closed or otherwise fails to publish a daily contract reference price on that day. In addition, if the trading facility fails to make a daily contract reference price available or publishes a daily contract reference price that, in the reasonable judgment of the Index Sponsor, reflects manifest error, the relevant calculation is delayed until the price is made available or corrected\u037e provided, that, if the price is not made available or corrected by 4:00 p.m. (New York time), the Index Sponsor may determine the appropriate daily contract reference price for the applicable futures contract in its reasonable judgment for purposes of the relevant S&P GSCI\u2122 calculation.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt is generally considered unlikely that a trading facility will fail to publish a daily contract reference price in the regular course of business, because the price is required to margin open positions in the relevant contracts. It is possible, however, that a trading facility will fail to publish a daily contract reference price under emergency or extraordinary conditions, such as in the event of a natural disaster, act of war or terrorist attack, that prevent trading or cause a termination of trading on a given day. A manifest error in a daily contract reference price is also unlikely to occur, but is nevertheless possible. This could arise, for example, in the event of a system malfunction that results in the published daily contract reference price being outside the range of trading for the relevant day. In that instance, it would be clear that the published price could not be correct and the Index Sponsor would likely disregard that price.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nContract Daily Return\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe contract daily return on any given day is equal to (1) (A) the sum, for each of the commodities included in the S&P GSCI\u2122, of the applicable daily contract reference price on the relevant contract multiplied by the appropriate CPW and the appropriate \u201croll weight,\u201d divided by (B) the total dollar weight of the S&P GSCI\u2122 on the preceding day, minus (2) one.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe \u201croll weight\u201d of each commodity reflects the fact that the positions in contracts must be liquidated or rolled forward into more distant Contract Expirations as they near expiration. If actual positions in the relevant markets were rolled forward, the roll would likely need to take place over a period of days. Since the S&P GSCI\u2122 is designed to replicate the performance of actual investments in the underlying contracts, the rolling process incorporated in the S&P GSCI\u2122 also takes place over a period of days at the beginning of each month, referred to as the \u201croll period.\u201d On each day of the roll period, the \u201croll weights\u201d of the first nearby Contract Expirations on a particular commodity and the more distant Contract Expiration into which it is rolled are adjusted, so that the hypothetical position in the contract on the commodity that is included in the S&P GSCI\u2122 is gradually shifted from the first nearby Contract Expiration to the more distant Contract Expiration.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       12\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf on any day during a roll period any of the following conditions exists, the portion of the roll that would have taken place on that day is deferred until the next day on which these conditions do not exist:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nthe contract is not available for trading on that day, the related trading facility is not scheduled to be open for trading for at least three hours, or no daily contract reference price is available for a given Contract Expiration\u037e\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nany such price represents the maximum or minimum price for that contract month, based on exchange price limits, referred to as a \u201cLimit Price\u201d\u037e\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nthe daily contract reference price published by the relevant trading facility reflects manifest error, or that price is not published by 4:00 p.m. (New York time).

Risk Factors.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisk Factors Relating to Commodities Markets\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe value of the Shares depends on the value of Index Futures, which fluctuates based on the prices of commodity futures contracts reflected in the S&P GSCI-ER. These prices may be volatile, thereby creating the potential for losses regardless of the length of time you intend to hold your Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBecause the price of the Shares depends on the value of the Index Futures held by the Trust, the value of the Shares fluctuates based on the prices of commodity futures contracts reflected in the S&P GSCI-ER. Commodity prices may be volatile. Commodity prices are generally affected by, among other factors, the cost of producing, transporting and storing commodities, changes in consumer or commercial demand for commodities, the hedging and trading strategies of producers and consumers of commodities, speculative trading in commodities by commodity pools and other market participants, disruptions in commodity supply, weather, political and other global events, global economic factors and government intervention in or regulation of the commodity or commodity futures markets. These factors cannot be controlled by the Trust. Accordingly, the price of the Shares could change substantially and in a rapid and unpredictable manner. This exposes you to a potential loss on your investment in the Shares, regardless of the length of time you intend to hold your Shares. Such risks may be exacerbated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWith regard to oil, a variety of factors can affect the price of oil and in turn the related Index Futures, including sudden and significant increases or decreases in production or available supply or significant increases or decreases in demand due to natural factors, epidemics, technological factors, tension and competition between oil exporting nations, war or other geopolitical conflicts,\u00a0civil unrest and sabotage, fluctuations in the reserve capacity, large purchases by governmental entities and competition from other energy sectors. Such risks historically and recently have led, and in the future could lead, to significant market volatility, which could impact the Index Futures held by the Trust and negatively impact the price of the Shares. Such risks may be exacerbated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn April 2020, the collapse of demand for fuel as a result of economic conditions relating to COVID-19 and other factors created an oversupply of crude oil that rapidly filled most available oil storage facilities. As a result, market participants that had agreed to take delivery of crude oil under the May 2020 WTI crude oil futures contract were at risk of default. In response, certain market participants took the extreme measure of selling their futures contracts at a negative price. This caused the May 2020 WTI crude oil futures contract to trade at a negative price. If all or a significant portion of the futures contracts reflected in the S&P GSCI ER were to reach a negative price, you could lose your entire investment.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       13\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe following events, among others, would generally result in a decline in the price of the Shares:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nA significant increase in hedging activity by producers of the underlying commodities. Should producers of the commodities underlying the S&P GSCI-ER increase their hedging of their future production through forward sales or other short positions, this increased selling pressure could depress the price of one or more of the underlying commodities, which could adversely affect the price of the Shares.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nA significant change in the attitude of speculators and investors toward the futures contracts or commodities underlying the S&P GSCI-ER. Should the speculative community take a negative view towards one or more of the underlying futures contracts or commodities, it could cause a decline in the price of the Index Futures, which may reduce the price of the Shares.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nBased on market conditions, futures contracts underlying the S&P GSCI-ER may trade or settle at or below zero, and the zero or negative value will be used in the calculation of impacted indices, including the S&P GSCI-ER. A zero or negative value in respect of one or more underlying futures contracts may result in a zero or negative value in respect of the S&P GSCI-ER\u00a0and, consequently, the Index Futures, adversely affecting the value of the Shares.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nSignificant reductions in the size of positions permitted to be owned by the Trust or others in Index Futures or in the futures contracts and/or commodities composing the S&P GSCI-ER, for example, as a result of more restrictive position limits or position limit exemptions or more expansive position aggregation requirements, could reduce liquidity and depress the price of the S&P GSCI-ER and/or the underlying futures contracts or commodities, adversely affecting the value of your Shares.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nConversely, several factors could trigger a temporary increase in the price of the futures contracts or commodities underlying the S&P GSCI-ER and, consequently, the Index Futures. In that case, you could buy Shares at prices affected by the temporarily high commodity prices, and you could subsequently incur losses when the causes for the temporary increase disappear.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHistorical performance of the Index and the S&P GSCI-ER is no guide to their future performance or to the performance of the Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPast performance of the Index and the S&P GSCI-ER is not necessarily indicative of their future performance or of the performance of the Shares. There can be no guarantee that the level of the Index or the S&P GSCI-ER will increase. You may lose some or all of your investment in the Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCommodity futures trading may be illiquid. In addition, suspensions or disruptions of market trading in the commodities markets and related futures markets may adversely affect the value of your Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe commodity futures markets are subject to temporary distortions or other disruptions due to various factors, including the lack of liquidity, congestion, disorderly markets, manipulation, limitations on deliverable supplies, the participation of speculators, government regulation and intervention, technical and operational or system failures, nuclear accidents, terrorism, riots and acts of God. In addition, U.S. futures exchanges and some foreign exchanges have regulations that limit the amount of fluctuation in futures contract prices that may occur during a single business day. These limits are generally referred to as \u201cdaily price fluctuation limits,\u201d and the maximum or minimum price of a contract on any given day as a result of these limits is referred to as a \u201climit price.\u201d Once the limit price has been reached in a particular contract, it is possible that no trades may be made at a different price. It is not certain how long any such price limits would remain in effect. Limit prices may have the effect of precluding trading in a particular contract or forcing the liquidation of contracts at disadvantageous times or prices, consequently affecting the value of the S&P GSCI-ER. Further, the Clearing FCM or its account holders may represent, directly or indirectly, a substantial portion of the short-side interest in the Index Futures market. The existence of such a limited number of market participants could cause or exacerbate temporary distortions, especially those distortions resulting from illiquidity.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAny of these circumstances could adversely affect the value of the Index Futures held by the Trust and therefore, the value of your Shares. In addition, these circumstances could also limit trading in the Index Futures, which could affect the calculation of the NAV and the trading price of the Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAccordingly, these limits may result in a NAV that differs, and may differ significantly, from the NAV that would prevail in the absence of such limits. If Baskets are created or redeemed at a time when these price limits are in effect, the creation or redemption price will reflect the price limits as well.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn calculating the S&P GSCI-ER, if the relevant trading facility does not publish a settlement price as scheduled, or publishes a settlement price that, in the reasonable judgment of the Index Sponsor, is manifestly incorrect, the Index Sponsor may determine the settlement price in its reasonable judgment. In addition, if any day on which the Index Sponsor calculates the S&P GSCI-ER is a day on which a relevant trading facility for a contract on a commodity that underlies the S&P GSCI-ER is not open, then the Index Sponsor uses the settlement price for that contract as of the last day on which that trading facility was open. In these circumstances, the value of the Index Futures and the value of your Shares may be adversely affected.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       14\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe absence of \n\u201c\nbackwardation\n\u201d\n or the existence of \n\u201c\ncontango\n\u201d\n in the prices of the commodities included in the S&P GSCI-ER may adversely affect the value of your Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs the futures contracts that underlie the S&P GSCI-ER near expiration, they are replaced by contracts that have a later expiration. Thus, for example, a contract purchased in March may specify a June expiration. As that contract nears expiration, it may be replaced by selling the June contract and purchasing the contract expiring in September. This process is referred to as \u201crolling.\u201d Historically, the prices of some futures contracts (generally those relating to commodities that are typically consumed immediately rather than stored) have frequently been higher for contracts with shorter-term expirations than for contracts with longer-term expirations, which is referred to as \u201cbackwardation.\u201d In these circumstances, absent other factors, the sale of the earlier contract would take place at a price that is higher than the price at which the later contract is purchased, thereby allowing the contract holder to purchase a greater quantity of the later contract. While some of the contracts included in the S&P GSCI-ER have historically exhibited periods of backwardation, backwardation will likely not exist at all times. Moreover, some of the commodities reflected in the S&P GSCI-ER have historically exhibited characteristics typical of \u201ccontango\u201d markets rather than backwardation. Contango markets are those in which the prices of contracts are higher in the distant delivery months than in the nearer delivery months due to the costs of long-term storage of a physical commodity prior to delivery or other factors. The forward price of a commodity futures contract may also fluctuate between backwardation and contango.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe absence of backwardation or the existence of contango in the commodity markets could result in losses, which could adversely affect the value of the S&P GSCI-ER and accordingly, decrease the value of your Shares. Moreover, because the Trust must pay certain ongoing fees and expenses, the value of the Shares may decrease even in periods where commodity prices are otherwise stationary.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhile contango and backwardation are consistently present in trading in the commodity markets, such conditions can be exacerbated by market forces. For example, following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, as a result of an excess supply of crude oil and weak demand as well as disputes among oil\u2011producing countries regarding limitations on oil production, the crude oil futures markets experienced extraordinarily high levels of contango in the first half of 2020, resulting in a negative price in the May 2020 WTI crude oil futures contract on April 20, 2020.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe effects of rolling futures contracts under such conditions generally are more severe than rolling futures contracts in the absence of such conditions. Such conditions may continue to exist, which could adversely affect the value of the S&P GSCI-ER and the Index Futures\u00a0and, accordingly, adversely affect the value of your Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRegulatory developments with respect to the futures and over-the-counter derivatives markets, and in particular, with respect to speculative trading in futures contracts and over-the-counter derivatives involving commodities and commodity indices, could adversely affect the value of your Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMany bills have been introduced in the U.S. Congress targeting excessive speculation in commodities and commodity indices, including by institutional index funds, on regulated futures markets and in the over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives markets. Many of these legislative proposals have not been enacted but could be in the future.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn 2010, Congress adopted certain anti-speculative proposals in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d). These provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have been interpreted by the CFTC to require the CFTC to expand its existing speculative position limits regime that is applicable to certain agricultural commodity futures (and options thereon), as appropriate, to a wider range of listed futures and options on physical commodities (including certain energy, metals and agricultural products) as well as to economically equivalent swaps. Pursuant to the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act described above, the CFTC proposed regulations in January 2020 (withdrawing previous proposals from 2013 and 2016),\u00a0that would impose new spot month federal position limits. Previously in December 2016, the CFTC adopted final position aggregation requirements.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn October 2020, the CFTC approved final rule amendments (the \u201cFinal Position Limits Rules\u201d) to its regulations of federal position limits on futures and options on certain energy, metal, and agricultural commodities and economically equivalent swaps (collectively, \u201cReferenced Contracts\u201d). Among other things, the Final Position Limits Rules include federal spot month position limits for derivatives contracts associated with 25 physical commodities (i.e., the nine \u201clegacy\u201d agricultural contracts already subject to federal position limits together with 16 new agricultural, metals and energy contracts). The Final Position Limits Rules were effective March 15, 2021, and a compliance date of January 1, 2022 applies to position limits for the 16 non-legacy contracts that are subject to federal position limits for the first time under the Final Position Limits Rules.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Final Position Limits Rules include as Referenced Contracts a number of the futures contracts included in the S&P GSCI-ER\u00a0and\u00a0as of the date of this report, such contracts represent a substantial portion of the weight of the S&P GSCI-ER. Consequently, under the Final Position Limits Rules, the maximum positions that market participants can hold for the spot month in the Referenced Contracts that underlie the S&P GSCI-ER are limited, which could reduce the liquidity of such Referenced Contracts and adversely affect the performance of the S&P GSCI-ER and the value of your Shares. Moreover, because the relative weights of the commodities in the S&P GSCI-ER are largely determined based on the trading volume of the futures contracts designated for such commodities, a reduction in the trading volume of such futures contracts could significantly alter the weights of the futures contracts underlying the S&P GSCI-ER, which could have further adverse effects on the level of the S&P GSCI-ER and the value of your Shares. The risks presented by the Final Position Limits Rules also arise with respect to existing federal limits on certain agricultural commodity futures contracts, which include futures contracts underlying the S&P GSCI-ER.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Final Position Limits Rules also revise the definition of \u201cbona fide hedging transaction or position,\u201d including revisions to expand the current list of enumerated bona fide hedging activities that are exempt from position limits rules and to provide more flexibility for market participants to qualify for bona fide hedge exemptions. Such revisions may affect the hedging and investing activities of participants in the markets for the Index Futures and the futures contracts and commodities underlying the S&P GSCI-ER, which in turn could reduce the liquidity and adversely affect the pricing of the Index Futures and such futures contracts and commodities. Any of these effects could increase volatility in and otherwise adversely affect the price of the Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       15\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWith respect to the position aggregation rules adopted by the CFTC in December 2016, those final rules, which became effective on February 14, 2017, expand the circumstances requiring persons to aggregate Referenced Contracts that are owned or controlled by such persons. Specifically, the final aggregation rules require a person holding positions in multiple commodity pools with substantially identical trading strategies to aggregate the pools\u2019 positions in Referenced Contracts, on a pro\u2011rata basis, with other positions in Referenced Contracts held or controlled by such person. These aggregation rules will apply to all commodity derivative contracts that are subject to position limits under the Final Position Limits Rules. CFTC staff has granted relief, until August 12, 2022, from various conditions and requirements in the final aggregation rules, including the \u201csubstantially identical trading strategies\u201d aggregation requirement. Under this relief, a person would not be required to aggregate positions on the basis of the \u201csubstantially identical trading strategies\u201d aggregation requirement unless the person is holding or controlling the trading of positions in multiple accounts or commodity pools with substantially identical trading strategies in order to willfully circumvent applicable position limits. Although Index Futures are not among the Referenced Contracts identified in the Final Position Limits Rules, if federal position limits are extended to Index Futures or if the Exchange adopts similar aggregation rules, some participants in the market for Index Futures may be encumbered in trying to hedge their exposure, which could reduce liquidity in such Index Futures and the futures contracts and commodities underlying the S&P GSCI-ER and adversely affect the value of the Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition to the Final Position Limits Rules, the CFTC could propose other rules that may lower the applicable position limits, apply position limits to a broader range of contracts (including commodity index contracts such as the Index Futures) or further restrict position limit exemptions. If any of these actions is taken, such measures could further reduce the size of positions that the Trust and other investors could hold directly in Index Futures and the underlying futures contracts and commodities, with potential reductions in liquidity and adverse effects on the pricing of Index Futures. See also \u201cThe value of the Shares depends on the value of Index Futures, which fluctuates based on the prices of commodity futures contracts reflected in the S&P GSCI-ER. These prices may be volatile, thereby creating the potential for losses regardless of the length of time you intend to hold your Shares.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust may be negatively impacted by the effects of the spread of illnesses or other public health emergencies on the global economy and the markets and service providers relevant to the performance of the Trust.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAn outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness, COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus was first detected in China in December 2019 and has now been spread globally. This outbreak has resulted in travel restrictions, closed international borders, enhanced health screenings at ports of entry and elsewhere, disruption of and delays in healthcare service preparation and delivery, prolonged quarantines, cancellations, supply chain disruptions, disruptions in markets, lower consumer demand, layoffs, defaults and other significant economic impacts, as well as general concern and uncertainty. Further, certain markets in which the Trust may invest may be subject to closures, and there can be no assurance that the ability to invest in Index Futures will continue in any segment of the markets in which the Trust invests, when any resumption of trading will occur or, once such markets resume trading, whether they will face further closures. Any suspension of the ability to invest in the Index Futures in which the Trust invests will impact the Trust\u2019s ability to purchase Index Futures and could cause the Trust to suspend the issuance of new Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe outbreak will continue to have serious negative effects on social, economic and financial systems, including significant uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets. The outbreak has caused increased volatility in the market for the Index Futures and the underlying futures contracts, which has led to increased trading spreads in the Index Futures and the underlying futures contracts, a higher than usual number of trading or price limits for certain underlying futures, reduced liquidity in the markets for the underlying futures contracts, and increased premium or discount in the Shares. A prolonged outbreak could result in an increase of the costs of the Trust, affect liquidity in the market for the Index Futures or the underlying futures contracts, as well as the correlation between the price of the Shares and the net asset value of the Trust, any of which could adversely affect the value of your Shares. In addition, the outbreak could also impair the information technology and other operational systems upon which the Trust\u2019s service providers, including the Sponsor, the Trustee and the Advisor, rely, and could otherwise disrupt the ability of employees of the Trust\u2019s service providers to perform essential tasks on behalf of the Trust. The impact of this outbreak has adversely affected the economies of many nations and the entire global economy and may impact individual issuers and capital markets in ways that cannot be foreseen. In the past, governmental and quasi-governmental authorities and regulators throughout the world have at times responded to major economic disruptions with a variety of fiscal and monetary policy changes, including, but not limited to, direct capital infusions into companies and other issuers, new monetary tools and lower interest rates. An unexpected or sudden reversal of these policies, or the ineffectiveness of these policies, is likely to increase volatility in the market for the Index Futures or the underlying futures contracts, which could adversely affect the price of the Shares. Other infectious illness outbreaks that may arise in the future could have similar impacts or other unforeseen effects. Public health crises caused by the outbreak may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic risks in certain countries or globally. The duration of the outbreak and its effects cannot be determined with certainty.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisk Factors Relating to Index Futures and the S&P GSCI-ER\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe trading of various Index Futures presents risks unrelated to the S&P GSCI-ER that could adversely affect the value of your Shares\n.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough Index Futures are based on the S&P GSCI-ER, the value of the Index Futures could be affected by factors that do not directly affect the S&P GSCI-ER and, accordingly, the value of the Index Futures and the level of the S&P GSCI-ER may vary from each other. The activities of market participants in trading Index Futures, or in trading other instruments related to the S&P GSCI-ER, could affect the value of the Index Futures independent of any change in the S&P GSCI-ER and adversely affect the correlation between the value of the Index Futures and the level of the S&P GSCI-ER.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe prices of the various Index Futures are expected to reflect supply and demand in the market for such Index Futures, which in turn may reflect market expectations at any given time about prospective changes in the level of the S&P GSCI-ER and other market conditions. In this way, trading in the market for an Index Futures contract might cause a divergence between the price of such Index Futures contract and the level of the S&P GSCI-ER. Similarly, actions by the applicable Exchange with respect to Index Futures, such as the imposition of trading or price limits, could adversely affect this correlation. In these circumstances, it is possible that changes in the NAV, which is calculated based on the value of the Index Futures, will not adequately reflect changes in the level of the S&P GSCI-ER. In the event of market disruptions with respect to the Index Futures, such as a suspension of trading by the related Exchange as a result of market activity, systems or communications failures or other causes, the value of the Index Futures and the level of the S&P GSCI-ER could diverge, which could adversely affect the value of the Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       16\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough arbitrage activity by market participants is expected to have the effect of reducing or mitigating divergence between the value of the Index Futures and the level of the S&P GSCI-ER, such arbitrage activity may not fully offset any divergence at all times during which the Shares are outstanding. During any period the Trust is trading Index Futures of more than one type, differences in the settlement values of such Index Futures, to the extent not offset by arbitrage activity between such Index Futures, may limit the expected benefits of, or otherwise adversely affect, arbitrage activity between the Shares and the Index Futures. In the event that any such divergence between the value of the Index Futures and the level of the S&P GSCI-ER exists from time to time, changes in the NAV, which is calculated based on the value of the Index Futures, may not adequately reflect changes in the level of the S&P GSCI-ER, which could adversely affect the value of the Shares. The impact of certain of these considerations may be heightened in cases where the Trust\u2019s positions are concentrated in a particular Index Futures contract or in cases where the Trust represents a substantial portion of the open interest in a particular Index Futures contract.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, other actions taken by an Exchange, including rule changes relating to clearing fees, margin requirements, or the minimum price fluctuations applicable to an Index Futures contract, may result in economic, tax or other consequences to market participants that trade or hold Index Futures. Such actions may result in consequences that adversely affect Shareholders without necessarily affecting the correlation between the settlement price of the Index Futures and the level of the S&P GSCI-ER.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe S&P GSCI-ER may in the future include contracts that are not traded on regulated futures exchanges and that offer different or diminished protections to investors.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCurrently, the S&P GSCI-ER is composed exclusively of futures contracts traded on designated contract markets (\u201cDCMs\u201d), or regulated futures exchanges. The S&P GSCI-ER may in the future include contracts (such as swaps and forward contracts) traded in the over-the-counter market or on trading facilities that are subject to lesser degrees of regulation or, in some cases, no substantive regulation. As a result, trading in such contracts, and the manner in which prices and volumes are reported by the relevant trading facilities, may not be subject to the same provisions of, and the protections afforded by, the CEA or other applicable statutes and related regulations that govern trading on regulated futures exchanges. In addition, many electronic trading facilities do not have significant trading histories. As a result, the trading of contracts on such facilities and the inclusion of such contracts in the S&P GSCI-ER may be subject to risks not presented by most exchange-traded futures contracts, including risks related to the liquidity and price histories of the relevant contracts.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nChanges in the composition and valuation of the S&P GSCI-ER may adversely affect your Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe composition of the S&P GSCI-ER may change over time as additional commodities satisfy the eligibility criteria or commodities currently included in the S&P GSCI\u2011ER fail to satisfy those criteria. The weighting factors applied to each commodity included in the S&P GSCI-ER change annually, based on changes in commodity production statistics and changes in the trading volume of the related futures contracts. In addition, the Index Sponsor may modify the method for determining the composition and weighting of the S&P GSCI-ER and for calculating its value. The methodology for determining the contracts to be included in the S&P GSCI-ER may be modified from time to time. Such changes could adversely affect the value of your Shares or otherwise affect the risks associated with owning the Shares, such as by increasing relative concentrations in particular commodities and causing the value of the Shares to become more sensitive to fluctuations in the prices of those commodities. For more information about the methodology for determining the composition and weighting of the S&P GSCI-ER, see \u201cBusiness \u2014 The Index and the S&P GSCI-ER.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBased on market conditions, futures contracts included in the S&P GSCI-ER may trade or settle at or below zero, and the zero or negative value will be used in the calculation of impacted indices, including the S&P GSCI-ER. Zero or negative values of futures contracts included in the S&P GSCI-ER occurring during a roll period may impact the composition of the S&P GSCI-ER.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor example, based on market conditions, the Index Committee may elect to implement an unscheduled designated contract roll in relation to the normal parameters of the roll of one or more futures contracts included in the S&P GSCI-ER. Among other things, this may entail adjustments to when the roll occurs, the length of the roll, the proportions of the roll, or the roll-in contract.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the event of the foregoing circumstances, the Index Committee has indicated it will aim to conform to the index\u2019s objective to the greatest extent possible, and will typically roll into the next most viable contract as published in the methodology. However, the Index Committee retains the right to roll into a further dated contract based on market conditions at the time of its decision.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the case of an unscheduled roll event, if there are no viable designated contracts to roll into, the Index Committee will convene and determine the appropriate course of action, which may include, but not be limited to, the removal of the contract from the S&P GSCI-ER. The Index Committee may review the contract roll schedule at any time and as market conditions warrant. Such changes could adversely affect the value of your Shares or otherwise affect the risks associated with owning the Shares, such as by increasing relative concentrations in particular commodities and causing the value of the Shares to become more sensitive to fluctuations in the prices of those commodities.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA cessation of publication of the S&P GSCI-ER could materially and adversely affect the activities of the Trust.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe S&P GSCI-ER is administered, calculated and published by the Index Sponsor, which has the right to cease publication of the S&P GSCI-ER at its discretion at any time. Under the terms of its agreement with the CME, the Index Sponsor is required, if it ceases publication of the S&P GSCI-ER, to negotiate in good faith with the CME to permit the CME to continue to calculate the S&P GSCI-ER in order to permit Index Futures on the S&P GSCI-ER to continue to trade. However, even if the Index Sponsor satisfies its obligations under its agreement with the CME, the Sponsor may determine that, upon a cessation of publication of the S&P GSCI-ER, it is no longer advisable to invest in Index Futures and no other futures contract that reflects the performance of a successor or reasonably similar index presents an acceptable alternative investment, in which event the Trust may be liquidated.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFutures contracts (including the Index Futures) are not assets with intrinsic value.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTrading in futures transfers the risk of future price movements from one market participant to another. This means that for every gain, there is an equal and offsetting loss. Futures contracts themselves (including Index Futures) are not assets with intrinsic value\u00a0and simply reflect, in the case of cash-settled contracts, certain rights to payment or obligations to make payments to the other party to the contract, and in the case of physically-settled contracts, such as the futures contracts underlying the Index, an agreement to make or take delivery of a particular asset at a specified price. Accordingly, market participants taking the opposite side of the Trust\u2019s Index Futures trades may believe that the price of such Index Futures will move against the Trust, and the Trust may be at an informational or other disadvantage relative to such market participants.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       17\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust\n\u2019\ns trading activity in Index Futures could expose it to additional risks.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn order for the Trust to achieve its investment objective on an ongoing basis, it is anticipated that existing positions in Index Futures will need to be closed out and new positions in Index Futures will need to be established from time to time. The Trust may further close out of existing positions and establish new positions in Index Futures from time to time, including new positions in earlier expiring Index Futures, which may allow it to reduce its concentration in any particular Index Futures contract or to benefit from more liquid markets or otherwise beneficial market activity in Index Futures listed with different expirations or on different Exchanges. This activity is expected to cause the Trust to incur transaction costs, such as brokerage fees and commissions, and may cause the Shares to under-perform the Index. In particular, the prices obtained in connection with rolling Index Futures positions may be adversely affected by market conditions (including the possibility of market disruptions) and by the trading activities of other market participants, which may reflect market awareness of the Trust\u2019s position in its Index Futures. For example, if other market participants are able to anticipate the timing of the Trust\u2019s transactions, they may be able to execute transactions in advance of the Trust, which would allow these market participants to benefit from the transactions executed by the Trust but adversely affect the prices obtained by the Trust. In addition, if the Trust\u2019s Index Futures positions represent a significant part of the open long interest in such Index Futures, as historically has been the case from time to time, other market participants may take this into account, with a potential adverse impact on the prices at which the Trust is able to execute such transactions. There can be no assurance that the Trust will be able to effect its transactions in a manner that will allow it to avoid these risks. The Exchange may cease to list other Index Futures that the Trust will be able to roll its positions into, and any Index Futures listed by an Exchange in the future may have terms that differ from those currently held by the Trust.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe liquidation of Index Futures could expose the Trust to the effects of temporary aberrations or distortions in the market, which could adversely affect the prices at which the Trust\n\u2019\ns Index Futures positions are liquidated.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf the Trust liquidates positions in Index Futures in order to satisfy redemption requests or to pay expenses and liabilities, it does so by entering sell orders with its Clearing FCM for execution on the Exchange. The resulting sales serve to offset a portion of the Trust\u2019s long positions in Index Futures. However, in entering sell orders, the Trust is subject to the risk that temporary aberrations or distortions will occur in the market at the time these sales are effected and that the prices received by the Trust on its sales could be adversely affected, thereby adversely affecting the value of the Shares. Such aberrations or distortions could occur as a result of trading activities by other market participants or actions taken by the Clearing FCM, an Exchange, other self\u2011regulatory organizations or regulatory authorities, including the liquidation of the Trust\u2019s Index Futures to satisfy applicable margin requirements. If the Trust\u2019s Index Futures are liquidated at inopportune times or in a manner that causes a temporary market distortion, this may adversely affect the NAV and the value of your Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Clearing FCM or an Exchange\n\u2019\ns clearing house could fail.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the event of the bankruptcy of the Clearing FCM or an Exchange\u2019s clearing house, the Trust could be exposed to a risk of loss with respect to its assets that are posted as margin. If such a bankruptcy were to occur, the Trust would be afforded the protections granted to customers of a FCM and participants to transactions cleared through a clearing house, under the United States Bankruptcy Code and applicable CFTC regulations. Such provisions generally provide for a pro rata distribution to customers of customer property held by the bankrupt FCM or an Exchange\u2019s clearing house if the customer property held by the FCM or the Exchange\u2019s clearing house is insufficient to satisfy all customer claims. In any case, there can be no assurance that these protections will be effective in allowing the Trust to recover all, or even any, of the amounts it has deposited as margin.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBankruptcy of the Clearing FCM can be caused by, among other things, the default of one of the Clearing FCM\u2019s customers. In this event, the Exchange\u2019s clearing house is permitted to use the entire amount of margin posted by the Trust (as well as margin posted by other customers of the Clearing FCM) to cover the amounts owed by the bankrupt Clearing FCM. Consequently, the Trust could be unable to recover amounts due to it on its Index Futures positions, including assets posted as margin, and could sustain substantial losses, even if the level of the S&P GSCI-ER increases.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Clearing FCM is subject to regulations relating to enhanced customer protections, risk management programs, internal monitoring and controls, capital and liquidity standards, customer disclosures and auditing and examination programs for FCMs. There can be no assurance that the implementation of these regulations will prevent losses to, or not materially adversely affect, the Trust or the Shareholders.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRecourse to the Index Sponsor may be limited.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Shares are not sponsored, endorsed, sold or promoted by the Index Sponsor. The Index Sponsor makes no representation or warranty, express or implied, to the owners of the Shares or any member of the public regarding the advisability of investing in securities generally or in the Shares particularly or the ability of the S&P GSCI\u2122, the S&P GSCI-ER or the Index, including, without limitation, all sub-indices, to track the appropriate market performance.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Index Sponsor\u2019s only relationship to the Sponsor, the Trustee, or the Trust is the licensing of certain trademarks, trade names of the Index Sponsor and the S&P GSCI\u2122 and other intellectual property. The S&P GSCI\u2122, the S&P GSCI-ER and the Index are determined and composed by the Index Sponsor and calculated by the Index Sponsor or its agents without regard to the Sponsor, the Trustee or the Trust. The Index Sponsor has no obligation to take the needs of the Sponsor, the Trustee, the Trust or the Shareholders into consideration in determining, composing or calculating the S&P GSCI\u2122, the S&P GSCI-ER or the Index. The Index Sponsor is not responsible for and has not participated in the determination of the prices and the number of Shares or the timing of the issuance or\u00a0sale of Shares or in the determination or calculation of the Basket Amount. The Index Sponsor has no obligation or liability in connection with the administration, marketing or trading of the Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       18\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Index Sponsor does not guarantee the accuracy or the completeness of the S&P GSCI\u2122, the S&P GSCI-ER or the Index or any data included therein, and the Index Sponsor disclaims any and all liability for any errors, omissions, or interruptions therein. The Index Sponsor makes no warranty, express or implied, as to the results to be obtained by the Trust, the Shareholders or any other person or entity from use of the S&P GSCI\u2122, the S&P GSCI-ER or the Index or any data included therein. The Index Sponsor makes no express or implied warranties, and expressly disclaims all warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose or use, with respect to the S&P GSCI\u2122, the S&P GSCI-ER or the Index or any data included therein. Without limiting any of the foregoing, the Index Sponsor expressly disclaims any and all liability for any special, punitive, indirect, or consequential damages (including lost profits), even if notified of the possibility of such damages.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisk Factors Relating to the Trust\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe returns on the Shares will not precisely correlate with the performance of the Index.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe value of and returns on the Shares are expected to reflect the value of and returns on the Trust\u2019s underlying investments in Index Futures and the cash or other Collateral Assets used to collateralize the Index Futures positions. The returns on the Shares will not precisely correlate with the performance of the Index due to, among other factors, differences between the return on the Collateral Assets and the U.S. Treasury rate used to calculate the U.S. Treasury return component of the Index, timing differences, differences between the portion of the Trust\u2019s assets invested in Index Futures versus the portion of the return of the Index contributed by the S&P GSCI-ER, differences between the settlement price of Index Futures and the closing level of the S&P GSCI-ER and the payment of expenses and liabilities by the Trust.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust is a passive investment vehicle. The Trust is not actively managed and will be affected by a general decline in the price of commodities.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Advisor manages the Trust\u2019s assets in a manner that seeks to obtain returns that correspond generally, but are not necessarily identical, to the performance of the Index, before the payment of expenses and liabilities of the Trust. This means that the net asset value of the Trust and, consequently, the NAV are intended to generally track the Index when it is flat or declining, as well as when it is rising, and therefore, it is highly likely that the value of the Shares will be adversely affected by a decline in commodity futures prices reflected in the Index. The Advisor does not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from, or to ameliorate losses caused by, changes in the level of the Index or the S&P GSCI-ER or the value of the Collateral Assets, including making use of any of the hedging techniques available to professional commodity futures traders to attempt to reduce the risks of losses resulting from commodity price decreases.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFees and expenses payable by the Trust are charged regardless of profitability and may result in a depletion of its assets.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust is subject to the fees and expenses described in this report, which are payable irrespective of profitability. These fees and expenses include an allocation to the Sponsor that accrues daily at an annualized rate of up to 0.75% of the Adjusted Net Asset Value of the Trust and is payable by the Trust monthly in arrears. The Sponsor\u2019s Fee may be adjusted by the Sponsor in its discretion from time to time to any amount up to 0.75% of the Adjusted Net Asset Value of the Trust. The Sponsor\u2019s Fee may not be adjusted to above 0.75% of the Adjusted Net Asset Value of the Trust absent an amendment to the Trust Agreement in accordance with its terms, and such an adjustment may only become effective thirty days after the Trustee has notified the registered holders of the amendment.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInterest earned on the assets posted as collateral is paid to the Trust and is used to pay the fixed fee to the Sponsor. A prolonged decline in interest rates could materially affect the amount of interest paid to the Trust. In the case of either an extraordinary expense and/or insufficient interest income to cover ordinary expenses, the Trust could be forced to liquidate its Index Futures positions to pay such expenses.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust\n\u2019\ns ability to operate is dependent on the Sponsor, the Trustee, the Advisor and certain other key service providers and other parties.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust\u2019s ability to operate and to achieve its investment objective is dependent on a number of parties, including:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nthe Sponsor, who exercises general oversight and authority over the Trust\u037e\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nthe Trustee, who is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Trust\u037e\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nthe Trust Administrator, who provides certain administrative and custodial services to the Trust\u037e\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nthe Advisor, who exercises general oversight over the Trust\u2019s investment activities\u037e\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nthe Clearing FCM, through which the Trust transacts in Index Futures and maintains its Index Futures positions\u037e\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nthe Exchange, through which the Trust\u2019s Index Futures transactions clear and settle\u037e\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nthe Index Sponsor, who maintains the Index, and whose affiliates own the rights to the Index on which the Trust\u2019s investment objective is based\u037e\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nthe Authorized Participants, whose creation and redemption activities allow Index Futures and Collateral Assets to be converted to Shares and vice versa, to help maintain the relationship between the Index and the Shares\u037e\u00a0and\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nthe tax administrator, who provides tax reporting and tax administrative services.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       19\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDisruptions in the business of any of the foregoing parties or the termination of the Trust\u2019s relationship with any of the foregoing parties could adversely affect the Trust\u2019s operations. Shared ownership of a number of the foregoing parties may heighten this risk. The Sponsor, the Trustee and the Advisor are commonly controlled subsidiaries of BlackRock. The Clearing FCM and one of its affiliates are Authorized Participants. A number of the foregoing parties are publicly traded companies or subsidiaries of publicly traded companies, and a portion of their shares may be owned by one or more of the other foregoing parties.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust is exposed to various operational risks.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust is exposed to various operational risks, including human error, information technology failures and failure to comply with formal procedures intended to mitigate these risks, and is particularly dependent on electronic means of communicating, record-keeping and otherwise conducting business. In addition, the Trust generally exculpates, and in some cases indemnifies, its service providers and agents with respect to losses arising from unforeseen circumstances and events, which may include the interruption, suspension or restriction of trading on or the closure of NYSE Arca, an Exchange, or an exchange on which the futures contracts underlying the Index trade, power or other mechanical or technological failures or interruptions, computer viruses, communications disruptions, work stoppages, natural disasters, fire, war, terrorism, riots, rebellions or other circumstances beyond the control of the Trust or its service providers and agents. Accordingly, the Trust generally bears the risk of loss with respect to these unforeseen circumstances and events to the extent relating to the Trust or the Shares, which may limit or prevent the Trust from generating returns corresponding to those of the Index or otherwise expose it to loss.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough it is generally expected that the Trust\u2019s direct service providers and agents will have disaster recovery or similar programs or safeguards in place to mitigate the effect of such unforeseen circumstances and events, there can be no assurance that these safeguards are in place for all parties whose activities may affect the performance of the Trust, or that these safeguards, even if implemented, will be successful in preventing losses associated with such unforeseen circumstances and events. Nor can there be any assurance that the systems and applications on which the Trust relies will continue to operate as intended. In addition to potentially causing performance failures at, or direct losses to, the Trust, any such unforeseen circumstances and events or operational failures may further distract the service providers, agents or personnel on which the Trust relies, reducing their ability to conduct the activities on which the Trust is dependent. These risks cannot be fully mitigated or prevented, and further efforts or expenditures to do so may not be cost\u2011effective, whether due to reduced benefits from implementing additional or redundant safeguards or due to increases in associated maintenance requirements and other expenses that may make it more costly for the Trust to operate in more typical circumstances.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe price you receive upon the sale of your Shares may be less than their NAV.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nShares may trade at, above or below their NAV. The NAV fluctuates with changes in the market value of the Trust\u2019s assets. The trading price of Shares fluctuates in accordance with changes in the NAV, intraday changes in the value of the Index Futures and market supply and demand. The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price of the Shares relative to their NAV may be influenced by non-concurrent trading hours between NYSE Arca, the exchange on which the Shares trade, the Exchanges on which Index Futures trade, and the principal commodities markets on which the futures contracts in the S&P GSCI-ER trade. While the Shares are expected to trade on NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. (New York time), liquidity in the markets for the Index Futures and the futures contracts underlying the S&P GSCI-ER is expected to be reduced whenever the principal markets for those contracts are closed. As a result, trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount on Shares, may widen during these gaps in market trading hours.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust is not obligated to pay periodic distributions or dividends to Shareholders.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInterest or other income received with respect to the Trust\u2019s assets may be used to acquire additional Index Futures or Collateral Assets or, in the discretion of the Sponsor, distributed to the Shareholders. The Trust is not obligated, however, to make any distributions to Shareholders at any time prior to the dissolution of the Trust and will not make any distributions to Shareholders upon dissolution of the Trust unless there are assets remaining following dissolution.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust could be liquidated at a time when the disposition of its interests will result in losses to investors in Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCertain events, such as the delisting of the Shares, the election by 75% of the Shareholders to dissolve the Trust, the resignation of the Trustee without a successor, the Trust becoming subject to regulation as an investment company, the determination by the Sponsor that the dissolution of the Trust is advisable, the Trust becoming subject to taxation as an association taxable as a corporation, or the DTC becoming unable or unwilling to perform its functions, may prompt the Trust\u2019s dissolution. Upon dissolution of the Trust, the Trust will in most circumstances sell the Index Futures and securities held by it in the amount necessary to cover all expenses of liquidation and to pay any outstanding liabilities of the Trust. The remaining assets will be distributed among investors surrendering Shares. In the event the Trustee cannot distribute such assets proportionately among the Shareholders entitled thereto or if the Trustee determines that such distribution is not lawful or feasible, the Trustee may use any other method of distribution that it deems to be lawful, equitable and feasible, including the public or private sale of Trust assets and the distribution of the proceeds thereof. Any property remaining in the possession of the Trustee after ninety days may be sold by the Trustee, and the proceeds of the sale will be held by the Trustee until claimed by any remaining Shareholders.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn connection with any such liquidation, Trust property may be sold for prices that are less than the portion of the NAV attributable to such Trust property. Accordingly, the liquidation of Trust property may result in losses, or adversely affect your gains, on your investment in Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Sponsor has broad discretion to liquidate the Trust at any time.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust Agreement provides the Sponsor with broad discretion to liquidate the Trust at any time the Sponsor determines that liquidation of the Trust is advisable. It cannot be predicted when or under what circumstances, if any, the Sponsor would use this discretion to liquidate the Trust. Any such liquidation may occur at a time when you are suffering a loss on your investment in the Shares and may upset the overall maturity and timing of your investment portfolio.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       20\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nShareholders with large holdings may choose to dissolve the Trust and thereby adversely affect your investment in the Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOwners of 75% or more of the Shares have the power to dissolve the Trust. This power may be exercised by a relatively small number of holders. If it is so exercised, investors who wished to continue to invest in the performance of the Index through the vehicle of the Trust will have to find another vehicle, and may not be able to find another vehicle that offers the same features as the Trust. Moreover, such a dissolution may occur at a time when you are suffering a loss on your investment in the Shares and may upset the overall maturity and timing of your investment portfolio.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAffiliate shareholders with large holdings may choose to conduct a large sale of their Shares, which may have an adverse effect on the Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBlackRock or other accounts managed by the Trustee or an affiliate may purchase and hold Shares of the Trust. These entities reserve the right, subject to compliance with applicable law, to sell Shares into the market or redeem in Baskets some or all of their Shares. A large-scale disposition of Shares could significantly reduce the asset size of the Trust, which would have an adverse effect on your Shares. Historically, such affiliated entities and accounts have owned a substantial portion of the Trust\u2019s total Shares outstanding from time to time, and may own a substantial portion of the Trust\u2019s total Shares outstanding from time to time in the future.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Shares may not provide anticipated benefits of diversification from other asset classes.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHistorically, the performance of physical commodity futures prices generally has not been correlated to the performance of financial asset classes, such as stocks and bonds. Non-correlation means that there is no statistically significant relationship, positive or negative, between the past performance of futures contracts on physical commodities, on the one hand, and stocks or bonds, on the other hand. Despite this lack of correlation, Shares cannot be expected to be automatically profitable during unfavorable periods for the stock or bond markets, or automatically unprofitable during favorable periods for the stock or bond markets. The commodity futures markets are fundamentally different from the securities markets in that for every gain in commodity futures trading, there is an equal and offsetting loss. The performance of the Shares may reflect positive or negative correlation to one or more financial asset classes, in which case any investment strategy relying on the absence of any such correlation may not be successful.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe liquidity of the Shares may be affected by the withdrawal from participation of Authorized Participants or by the suspension of issuance, transfers or redemptions of Shares by the Trustee\n.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf one or more Authorized Participants withdraw from participation, it may become more difficult to create or redeem Baskets, which may reduce the liquidity of the Shares. If it becomes more difficult to create or redeem Baskets, the correlation between the price of the Shares and the NAV may be affected, which may affect the trading market for the Shares. Having fewer participants in the market for the Shares could also adversely affect the ability to arbitrage any price difference between the Index Futures and the Shares, which may affect the trading market and liquidity of the Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, the Trustee has the power to suspend the delivery of Shares, registration of transfers of Shares and surrenders of Shares for the purpose of withdrawing Trust property generally, or to refuse a particular deposit, transfer or withdrawal at any time, if the Trustee or the Sponsor determines that it is advisable to do so for any reason. From August 24, 2009 to April 26, 2010, the Trust suspended the issuance of new Shares because the Trust could not invest the proceeds of new issuances in additional Index Futures positions due to restrictions on speculative position limits imposed by the CME. The liquidity of the Shares and the correlation between the value of the Shares and the level of the Index may be adversely affected in the event of any such suspension of issuance, transfer or redemption.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe lack of an active trading market for the Shares may result in losses on your investment at the time of disposition of your Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough the Shares are listed on NYSE Arca, there can be no guarantee that an active trading market for the Shares will develop or be maintained. If you need to sell your Shares at a time when no active market for them exists, the price you receive for your Shares, assuming that you are able to sell them, will likely be lower than that you would receive if an active market did exist.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nYou may be adversely affected by redemption orders that are subject to postponement, suspension or rejection under certain circumstances.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trustee may suspend the right of redemption or postpone the redemption settlement date for such periods as it or the Sponsor deems to be necessary for any reason. In addition, the Trustee has the right to reject any redemption order for any reason, including, among others, (1) the related order not being in proper form as described in the Authorized Participant agreement, (2) market conditions or other circumstances that make transactions in or delivery of the Shares or the Index Futures impossible or impractical, (3) a determination by the Trustee that the acceptance of the related order would have adverse tax or other consequences to the Trust or the Shareholders, or (4) circumstances that would cause the acceptance of the related order to result in a violation of law in the opinion of counsel to the Trustee, the Sponsor or the Trust Administrator. Any such postponement, suspension or rejection could adversely affect a redeeming Authorized Participant. For example, the resulting delay may adversely affect the value of the redemption proceeds if the NAV declines during the period of the delay. Under the Authorized Participant agreement, the Trustee disclaims any liability that may result from any such suspension, postponement or rejection.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCompetition from other commodities-related investments could limit the market for, and reduce the liquidity of, the Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDemand for the Shares is expected to be affected by the attractiveness of an investment in the Shares relative to other investment vehicles, including other commodity pools, hedge funds, traditional debt and equity securities issued by companies in the commodities industry, other securities backed by or linked to commodities, and direct investments in commodities or commodity futures contracts. Market, financial and other conditions or factors may make it more attractive to invest in other investment vehicles or to invest in such commodities directly, which could limit the market for, and reduce the liquidity of, the Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       21\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe price of the Shares could decrease if unanticipated operational or trading problems arise.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf the processes of creation and redemption of Shares encounter any unanticipated difficulties, potential market participants who would otherwise be willing to purchase or redeem Baskets to take advantage of any arbitrage opportunity arising from discrepancies between the price of the Shares and the price of the underlying Index Futures may choose not to do so. If this is the case, the price of the Shares may vary from the price of an equivalent position in Index Futures and may trade at a discount to their NAV. In addition, in some circumstances, such as the failure of the registration statement covering the Shares to be effective, the Trust may be unable to create or redeem Shares, which may have similar consequences.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nExchange position limits and other rules may restrict the creation of Baskets and the operation of the Trust.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe CME imposes speculative position limits on market participants trading in Index Futures, including the Trust, that typically prohibit any person from holding a position in excess of a specified number of contracts. The Trust may from time to time seek to obtain exemptions from those position limits from the CME, but these exemptions may be limited, including with respect to the additional number of contracts permitted to be held under such exemption and the time period for which the exemption applies. Position limits may also apply to other Index Futures traded by the Trust. The availability of obtaining any exemption from any such position limits is expected to be subject to the ability or willingness of the applicable Exchange to grant such exemption, as well as applicable law.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust\u2019s ability to issue new Baskets or reinvest income in additional Index Futures may be limited to the extent these activities would cause the Trust to exceed the position limits then applicable to those Index Futures. The Trust may also be required to liquidate any existing contracts in excess of the then-applicable position limits, including as a result of changes to applicable position limits or as a result of the loss of an exemption, or be required to take other actions with potentially adverse effects on the liquidity or value of the Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, legislative or regulatory action, actions by a DCM or actions by the Clearing FCM may impose limitations on the size of positions that the Trust may take in Index Futures and/or impose limitations on the size of positions that may be carried by other market participants, adversely affecting the liquidity and price of Index Futures and the underlying futures. Such events could force the Trust or other market participants to sell Index Futures, or encourage market participants to sell or redeem their Shares. In addition, the current maximum position in Index Futures permitted to be held by the Trust could be reduced relative to the maximum position otherwise permitted, which could in turn require the Trust to liquidate some or all of its positions in Index Futures. Any such reduction could affect the liquidity of Index Futures and adversely impact the price of the Shares as well as the correlation between the price of the Shares and the net asset value of the Trust.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDCMs may also take steps, such as requiring liquidation of open positions, in the case of disorderly markets, market congestion and other market disruptions. These actions could require the Trust to liquidate all or part of its Index Futures positions or require holders of positions in the futures contracts underlying the S&P GSCI-ER to liquidate their positions. This could affect the level of the Index and the NAV. See also \u201cRisk Factors Relating to Commodities Markets\u2014Regulatory developments with respect to the futures and over-the-counter derivatives markets, and in particular, with respect to speculative trading in futures contracts and over-the-counter derivatives involving commodities and commodity indices, could adversely affect the value of your Shares.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn May 13, 2020, the CFTC published a Staff Advisory on Risk Management and Market Integrity under Current Market Conditions addressed to DCMs, FCMs and derivatives clearing organizations (\u201cDCOs\u201d) registered with the CFTC (the \u201cStaff Advisory\u201d). The Staff Advisory notes that adverse economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have coincided with substantially increased market volatility in key agricultural, energy, and financial sectors, including the futures and options on futures markets regulated by the CFTC, and that the impact has been particularly acute for contracts that call for physical delivery of the underlying commodity.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Staff Advisory notes DCMs, FCMs and DCOs should prepare for the possibility that certain contracts may continue to experience extreme market volatility, low liquidity and possibly negative pricing. Such preparations include assessment of risk controls and related mechanisms in light of market conditions, including whether such risk controls and related mechanisms are reasonably designed, fit for purpose, and appropriately implemented. In response to the Staff Advisory and other factors, the Trust may be subject to increased margin requirements and limitations on the size of positions that the Trust may take in Index Futures. Other market participants may also be subject to increased margin requirements and position limits, adversely affecting the liquidity and price of Index Futures and the underlying futures. Such events could force the Trust or other market participants to sell Index Futures, or encourage market participants to sell or redeem their Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nShareholders do not have the rights normally associated with ownership of common shares\n\u037e\n the Sponsor and the Trustee exercise substantial control over the Trust.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nShareholders are not entitled to the same rights as owners of shares issued by a corporation. By acquiring Shares, you are not acquiring the right to elect directors, to receive dividends, to vote on certain matters regarding the Trust or to take other actions normally associated with the ownership of common shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, the Sponsor and the Trustee exercise substantial control over the Trust\u2019s activities. Among other things, the Trust Agreement authorizes the Sponsor to determine whether to make distributions to Shareholders, gives the Sponsor oversight over NAV calculations and the creation and redemption process and permits the Sponsor to dissolve the Trust if it deems such dissolution advisable. The Trustee also retains the right to reject any order for the creation or redemption of Baskets. The Sponsor and the Trustee may amend the provisions of the Trust Agreement, including in a manner adverse to Shareholders, without Shareholder consent, including to change the assets through which the Trust seeks to achieve its investment objective, which may alter the nature of an investment in, and the performance of, the Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust Agreement provides that in the case of a conflict of interest between the Trustee, the Sponsor and their affiliates, on the one hand, and the holders of Shares, on the other, the Trustee and the Sponsor will resolve such conflict considering the relevant interests of each party (including their own interests) and related benefits and burdens, any customary or accepted industry practices, and any applicable generally accepted accounting practices or principles. The Trust Agreement further provides that in the absence of bad faith by the Trustee or the Sponsor, such a resolution will not constitute a breach of the Trust Agreement or any duty or obligation of the Trustee or the Sponsor.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       22\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nShareholders do not have the protections normally associated with the ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust is not registered as an investment company for purposes of United States federal securities laws, and is not subject to regulation by the SEC as an investment company. Consequently, Shareholders do not have the regulatory protections provided to investors in investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act. For example, the provisions of the Investment Company Act that limit transactions with affiliates, prohibit the suspension of redemptions (except under limited circumstances) and limit sales loads do not apply to the Trust. The Sponsor is registered with the CFTC as a commodity pool operator and the Advisor is registered with the CFTC as a commodity trading advisor. The CFTC therefore has jurisdiction over these entities and regulatory authority over certain activities of the Trust. The nature and degree of this regulation differs from the regulatory scheme imposed under the Investment Company Act.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCompeting claims over ownership of relevant intellectual property rights could adversely affect the Trust or an investment in the Shares\n.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhile the Sponsor believes that it has all of the intellectual property rights needed to operate the Trust in the manner described in the Trust\u2019s prospectus, third parties may allege or assert ownership of intellectual property rights that may be related to the design, structure and operation of the Trust or the Index. To the extent any claims of such ownership are brought or any proceedings are instituted to assert such claims, the negotiation, litigation or settlement of such claims, the issuance of any restraining orders or injunctions, or the ultimate disposition of such claims in a court of law, may adversely affect the Trust and the value of the Shares. For example, such actions could result in expenses or damages payable by the Trust or the suspension of activities or dissolution of the Trust.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe value of the Shares will be adversely affected if the Trust is required to indemnify the Sponsor, the Advisor or the Trustee or their respective agents.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnder the Trust Agreement, the Sponsor, the Trustee and their respective agents have the right to be indemnified by the Trust for any liability or expense they incur without negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct or reckless disregard of their duties on their part. That means the Sponsor or the\u00a0Trustee may require the assets of the Trust to be sold in order to cover losses or liabilities suffered by it, which would reduce the net asset value of the Trust and the value of the Shares. Likewise, under the Trust\u2019s advisory agreement, the Advisor and its agents have the right to be indemnified by the Trust for any liability or expense they incur without negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct or reckless disregard of their duties on their part. That means the Advisor may require the assets of the Trust to be sold in order to cover losses or liabilities suffered by it, which would reduce the net asset value of the Trust and the value of the Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRegulatory changes or actions may affect the Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe futures markets are subject to comprehensive regulation. In addition, the CFTC and the exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency, including, for example, implementing speculative position limits (including retroactively) or higher margin requirements, establishing daily price limits and suspending trading. The regulation of futures transactions in the United States is subject to modification by government, exchange and judicial action. The effect of any future regulatory change on the Trust could be substantial and adverse. See also \u201c\u2014Exchange position limits and other rules may restrict the creation of Baskets and the operation of the Trust\u201d above and \u201cRisk Factors Relating to Commodities Markets \u2014 Regulatory developments with respect to the futures and over-the-counter derivatives markets, and in particular, with respect to speculative trading in futures contracts and over-the-counter derivatives involving commodities and commodity indices, could adversely affect the value of your Shares.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNYSE Arca may halt trading in the Shares, which would adversely impact your ability to sell your Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca under the ticker symbol GSG. Trading in the Shares may be halted due to market conditions or, in light of NYSE Arca rules and procedures, for reasons that, in the view of NYSE Arca, make trading in the Shares inadvisable, or in the event certain information about the Index, the value of the Shares and the NAV is not made available as required by such rules and procedures. In addition, trading generally on NYSE Arca is subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to circuit breaker rules that require trading to be halted for a specified period based on a specified market decline. There can be no assurance that the requirements necessary to maintain the listing of the Shares will continue to be met or will remain unchanged. The Trust will be dissolved if the Shares are delisted from NYSE Arca and are not approved for listing on another national securities exchange within five business days of their delisting.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisk Factors Relating to Conflicts of Interest\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Sponsor\n\u2019\ns relationship with the Trustee and the Advisor and the proprietary and managed trading activities of the Sponsor and its affiliates could conflict with your interests as a Shareholder.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Sponsor is an affiliate of the Trustee and therefore may have a conflict of interest with respect to its oversight of the Trustee. In particular, the Sponsor, which has authority to remove the Trustee in its discretion, has an incentive not to exercise this authority, even when it is in the best interests of the Shareholders to do so, because of the affiliation between the entities. The Trustee is authorized to appoint an unaffiliated Trust Administrator or other agent to carry out all or some of its duties under the Trust Agreement, but is not required to delegate any of its duties to an unaffiliated third party.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Sponsor is an affiliate of the Advisor and therefore may have a similar conflict of interest with respect to its oversight of the Advisor. For example, although the Sponsor has the authority to terminate the Trust\u2019s advisory agreement with the Advisor, it has an incentive not to exercise this authority, even when it is in the best interests of the Shareholders to do so, because of the affiliation between the entities.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       23\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs described elsewhere in this report, in return for paying certain amounts that would otherwise be considered ordinary operating expenses of the Trust, the Sponsor receives an allocation from the Trust that accrues daily at an annualized rate of up to 0.75% of the Adjusted Net Asset Value of the Trust, is payable monthly in arrears, and is subject to adjustment from time to time, except that the Sponsor\u2019s Fee may not be adjusted to above 0.75% of the Adjusted Net Asset Value absent an amendment to the Trust Agreement and thirty days\u2019 prior notice to registered holders of the Shares. The allocation received by the Sponsor from the Trust may be higher than the amount the Trust would negotiate with an unaffiliated third party manager on an arms-length basis.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, the Sponsor and its affiliates (including the Trustee and the Advisor) collectively exercise substantial control over the Trust. To the extent the interests of the Sponsor and its affiliates conflict with those of the Trust and the Shareholders, the risks associated with such conflicts may be greater than they would otherwise be for a party that cannot exercise such control over the Trust. The Trust Agreement provides that in the case of a conflict of interest between the Trustee, the Sponsor and their affiliates, on the one hand, and the holders of Shares, on the other, the Trustee and the Sponsor will resolve such conflict considering the relevant interests of each party (including their own interests) and related benefits and burdens, any customary or accepted industry practices, and any applicable generally accepted accounting practices or principles. The Trust Agreement further provides that in the absence of bad faith by the Trustee or the Sponsor, such a resolution will not constitute a breach of the Trust Agreement or any duty or obligation of the Trustee or the Sponsor.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Sponsor and its affiliates may also engage in trading activities relating to the Index Futures, the components of the Index or the S&P GSCI-ER or other derivative instruments related to those indices that are not for the account of, or on behalf of, the Trust or the Shareholders and that may compete with trading activity in the Shares. These activities may present a conflict between the Shareholders\u2019 interest in the Shares and the interest of the Sponsor and its affiliates in their proprietary accounts, in facilitating transactions, including derivatives transactions, for their customers\u2019 accounts and in accounts under their management. These trading activities could be adverse to the interests of the Shareholders. Moreover, the Sponsor and its affiliates have published and in the future expect to publish research reports with respect to commodities markets. This research may express opinions or provide recommendations that are inconsistent with purchasing or holding Shares. The research should not be viewed as a recommendation or endorsement of the Shares in any way, and investors must make their own independent investigation of the merits of this investment. Any of these activities by the Sponsor and its affiliates may affect the level of the S&P GSCI-ER or its components and, therefore, the value of the Index Futures and the price of the Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nProprietary trading and other activities by Goldman Sachs and its affiliates could conflict with your interests as a Shareholder.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nActivities conducted by Goldman Sachs and its affiliates may conflict with your interests as a Shareholder. For example, the Advisor may execute a substantial amount, and potentially all, of the purchases and sales of Index Futures through Goldman Sachs, as the Trust\u2019s Clearing FCM. In addition, it is expected that Goldman Sachs or its accountholders will represent, directly or indirectly, a substantial portion of the short-side market for the Index Futures. Further, Goldman Sachs and its affiliates actively trade futures contracts and options on futures contracts on the commodities that underlie the S&P GSCI\u2122, over-the-counter contracts on these commodities, the underlying commodities included in the S&P GSCI\u2122 and other instruments and derivative products based on the S&P GSCI\u2122 and the S&P GSCI-ER. Any of these activities of Goldman Sachs or its affiliates could adversely affect the level of the S&P GSCI-ER or the Index Futures, directly or indirectly, by affecting the price of the underlying commodities and, therefore, the value of the S&P GSCI\u2011ER, the Index Futures and the price of the Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGoldman Sachs and its affiliates may also issue or underwrite other securities or financial or derivative instruments with returns indexed to the S&P GSCI\u2122, the S&P GSCI-ER or the Index, which would compete with the Shares. By introducing competing products into the marketplace, Goldman Sachs and its affiliates could adversely affect the price of the Shares. To the extent that Goldman Sachs or any of its affiliates serve as issuer, agent or underwriter of those securities or other similar instruments, their interests with respect to those products may be adverse to your interests as a Shareholder.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisk Factors Relating to Taxes\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nYour tax liability could exceed cash distributions on your Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nYou will be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on your allocable share of the Trust\u2019s income, without regard to the receipt of cash distributions on the Shares. There is no obligation to make distributions on the Shares. Accordingly, it is anticipated that you will not receive cash distributions sufficient to cover your allocable share of such taxable income or even the tax liability resulting from that income.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (the \n\u201c\nIRS\n\u201d\n) could adjust or reallocate items of income, gain, deduction, loss and credit with respect to the Shares if the IRS does not accept the assumptions or conventions utilized by the Trust.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe U.S. federal income tax rules that apply to partnerships are complex and their application is not always clear. Moreover, the rules generally were not written for, and in some respects are difficult to apply to, publicly traded interests in partnerships. In addition, the Trust will report tax information to you on IRS Schedule K-1 with respect to the Shares. The Trustee shall deliver or cause to be delivered to each Shareholder an IRS Schedule K-1 as soon as practicable following each fiscal year but generally not later than March 15. Reporting on IRS Schedule K-1 may be somewhat more complex than comparable reporting on IRS Form 1099. Each Shareholder, by its acquisition of Shares, will be deemed to agree to allow brokers and nominees to provide to the Trust its name and address and the other information and forms as may be reasonably requested by the Trust for purposes of complying with their tax reporting and withholding obligations (and to waive any confidentiality rights with respect to the information and forms for this purpose) and to provide information or forms upon request.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInvestors in the Shares should consult their tax advisors in determining how to use the information reported on IRS Schedule K-1 to complete their income tax returns. The Trust will apply certain assumptions and conventions intended to comply with the intent of the rules and to report income, gain, deduction, loss and credit to investors in a manner that reflects the investors\u2019 economic gains and losses, but these assumptions and conventions may not comply with all aspects of the applicable Treasury regulations. It is possible therefore that the IRS will successfully assert that these assumptions or conventions do not satisfy the technical requirements of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the \u201cCode\u201d) or the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and will require that items of income, gain, deduction, loss and credit be adjusted or reallocated in a manner that could be adverse to you.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       24\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf the Trust were to fail to qualify as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Trust\n\u2019\ns income and items of deduction would not pass through to the Shareholders, the Trust would be required to pay tax at corporate rates on any portion of the Trust\n\u2019\ns net income that does not constitute tax-exempt income and distributions by the Trust to the Trust\n\u2019\ns Shareholders would be taxable dividends to the extent of the Trust\n\u2019\ns earnings and profits.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt is expected that the Trust will operate and be classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. So long as the Trust qualifies as a partnership, it will be able to pass through its income, including the Trust\u2019s federally tax-exempt income, if any, and deductions to the Shareholders. The Trust\u2019s qualification as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes involves the application of numerous technical provisions under which there is a lack of direct authority. In general, if a partnership is publicly traded, as defined in the Code, it will be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It is expected that the Trust will be treated as a publicly traded partnership. A publicly traded partnership will, however, be taxed as a partnership, and not as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, so long as 90% or more of its gross income for each taxable year constitutes qualifying income within the meaning of Section 7704(d) of the Code and the partnership is not required to register under the Investment Company Act. This exception is referred to as the \u201cqualifying income exception.\u201d Qualifying income generally includes interest (other than certain contingent interest and interest derived in the conduct of a financial or insurance business), dividends, real property rents and income from certain commodities transactions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf less than 90% of the Trust\u2019s gross income for any tax year constitutes qualifying income, for any reason, other than a failure that is determined to be inadvertent and that is cured within a reasonable time after discovery, or if the Trust is required to register under the Investment Company Act, the Trust\u2019s items of income and deduction would not pass through to the Trust\u2019s Shareholders and the Trust\u2019s Shareholders would be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as stockholders in a corporation. The Trust would be required to pay income tax at corporate rates on its net taxable income. Distributions by the Trust to its Shareholders would constitute dividend income taxable to such holders to the extent of the Trust\u2019s earnings and profits and the payment of these distributions would not be deductible by the Trust. These consequences could have a material adverse effect on the Trust, its Shareholders and the value of the Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf the IRS makes audit adjustments to the Trust\n\u2019\ns income tax returns for tax years beginning after 2017, it may collect any resulting taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly from the Trust, in which case the cash available for the distribution to the Trust\n\u2019\ns Shareholders might be substantially reduced.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf the IRS makes audit adjustments to the Trust\u2019s U.S. federal income tax returns for the Trust\u2019s taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, it may collect any resulting taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly from the Trust. The Trust may have the ability to shift any such tax liability to the Sponsor and the Trust\u2019s Shareholders in accordance with their interests in the Trust during the year under audit, but there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so, in which case the current Shareholders would economically bear the burden of the tax even if they were not Shareholders during the year under audit (or if they had a different percentage interest in the Trust in that year). If the Trust is required to make payments of taxes, penalties and interest resulting from audit adjustments, the cash available for distribution to the Trust\u2019s Shareholders might be substantially reduced. Investors in the Shares are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding these rules and their potential impact.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nShareholders that are not U.S. persons could be subject to U.S. federal income tax, including a 10% withholding tax, on the disposition of their Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough the Trust intends to conduct its activities in a manner that avoids the conduct of a U.S. trade or business, if the IRS were to determine that the Trust is engaged in a U.S. trade or business for U.S. federal income tax purposes, any gain recognized by a foreign transferor on the sale, exchange or other disposition of Shares would generally be treated as \u201ceffectively connected\u201d with such trade or business to the extent it does not exceed the effectively connected gain that would be allocable to the transferor if the Trust sold all of its assets at their fair market value as of the date of the transferor\u2019s disposition. Any such gain that is treated as effectively connected will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax. In addition, the transferee of the Shares or the applicable withholding agent would be required to deduct and withhold a tax equal to 10% of the amount realized by the transferor on the disposition, which would include an allocable portion of the Trust\u2019s liabilities and would therefore generally exceed the amount of cash received by the transferor in the disposition, unless the transferor provides an affidavit stating the transferor\u2019s taxpayer identification number and that the transferor is not a foreign person. If the transferee fails to properly withhold such tax, the Trust would be required to deduct and withhold from distributions to the transferee a tax in an amount equal to the amount the transferee failed to withhold, plus interest.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe withholding requirements with respect to the disposition of an interest in a publicly traded partnership apply to dispositions made on or after January\u00a01,\u00a02023.\u00a0Any future additional guidance on the implementation of these requirements will be applicable on a prospective basis.\u00a0Investors in the Shares are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding these changes and their potential impact.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "item7": ">Item 7.

Following the close of business on December 31, 2013, the Investing Pool was liquidated and the interests in the Investing Pool held by the Trust and the Investing Pool\u2019s manager were redeemed for all assets and liabilities held by the Investing Pool. As a result of the liquidation of the Investing Pool, the Trust now holds and transacts in Index Futures directly. Historical results reflect the Trust\u2019s activities, had it conducted its activities directly rather than through the Investing Pool.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDuring the period beginning July 10, 2006 (commencement of operations) and ending on December 31, 2021 (the Trust\u2019s most recent fiscal year-end), the Trust\u2019s net asset value grew from $7,358,911 at July 10, 2006 to $1,431,810,115 at December 31, 2021. Outstanding Shares in the Trust grew from 150,000 Shares at July 10, 2006 to 83,750,000 Shares at December 31, 2021.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs described in Part I above, the Trust seeks to track the results of a fully collateralized investment in futures contracts on an index composed of a diversified group of commodity futures. The Trust seeks to track the investment returns of the Index before payment of the Trust\u2019s expenses and liabilities. The Index is a statistical composite that tracks a diversified group of commodity futures. The Index does not actually hold a portfolio of futures contracts and does not incur the fees and expenses incurred by the Trust. These fees and expenses negatively impact the Trust\u2019s performance relative to that of the Index.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       27\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe following graph presents the change in NAV of the Trust and the closing level of the Index for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nResults of Operations\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Year Ended December 31, 2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust\u2019s net asset value increased from $827,346,620 at December 31, 2020 to $1,431,810,115 at December 31, 2021. The increase in the Trust\u2019s net asset value resulted primarily from a net increase in net assets resulting from operations. The Trust\u2019s net asset value also benefitted from an increase in the number of outstanding Shares, which rose from 67,250,000 Shares at December 31, 2020 to 83,750,000 Shares at December 31, 2021, a consequence of 34,750,000 Shares (695 Baskets) being created and 18,250,000 Shares (365 Baskets) being redeemed during the year.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe 39.02% increase in the NAV from $12.30 at December 31, 2020 to $17.10 at December 31, 2021 is directly related to the 40.29% increase in the settlement price for the Index Futures. The\u00a0NAV increased slightly less than the settlement price for the Index Futures on a percentage basis due to the Sponsor\u2019s fees and brokerage commissions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $366,008,957, resulting from a net investment loss of $10,385,215 and a net investment gain of $376,394,172. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Trust had a net realized and unrealized gain of $4,847 on short-term investments and a net realized and unrealized gain of $376,389,325 on futures contracts. Other than the Sponsor\u2019s fees of $9,465,137 and brokerage commissions and fees of $1,346,112, the Trust had no expenses during the year.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Year Ended December 31, 2020\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust\u2019s net asset value increased from $775,343,105 at December 31, 2019 to $827,346,620 at December 31, 2020. The increase in the Trust\u2019s net asset value resulted primarily from a net increase in the number of outstanding Shares, which rose from 47,750,000 Shares at December 31, 2019 to 67,250,000 Shares at December 31, 2020, a consequence of 31,850,000 Shares (637 Baskets) being created and 12,350,000 Shares (247 Baskets) being redeemed during the year. The increase in the Trust\u2019s net asset value was partially offset by a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe 24.26% decrease in the\u00a0NAV from $16.24 at December 31, 2019 to $12.30 at December 31, 2020 is directly related to the 24.02% decrease in the settlement price for the Index Futures. The\u00a0NAV decreased slightly more than the settlement price for the Index Futures on a percentage basis due to the Sponsor\u2019s fees and brokerage commissions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe net decrease in net assets resulting from operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $183,615,251, resulting from a net realized and unrealized loss of $181,338,900 and by a net investment loss of $2,276,351. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Trust had a net realized and unrealized loss of $19,454 on short-term investments and a net realized and unrealized loss of $181,319,446 on futures contracts. Other than the Sponsor\u2019s Fees of $5,005,767 and brokerage commissions and fees of $1,013,439, the Trust had no expenses during the year.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       28\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Year Ended December 31, 2019\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust\u2019s net asset value decreased from $1,209,866,609 at December 31, 2018 to $775,343,105 at December 31, 2019. The decrease in the Trust\u2019s net asset value resulted primarily from a net decrease in the number of outstanding Shares, which fell from 86,500,000 Shares at December 31, 2018 to 47,750,000 Shares at December 31, 2019, a consequence of 11,950,000 Shares (239 Baskets) being created and 50,700,000 Shares (1,014 Baskets) being redeemed during the year. The decrease in the Trust\u2019s net asset value was partially offset by an increase in net assets resulting from operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe 16.08% increase in the\u00a0NAV from $13.99 at December 31, 2018 to $16.24 at December 31, 2019 is directly related to the 14.76% increase in the settlement price for the Index Futures. The\u00a0NAV increased slightly more than the settlement price for the Index Futures on a percentage basis due to interest income from U.S. Treasury bills.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $174,936,959, resulting from a net realized and unrealized gain of $161,911,117 and by a net investment income of $13,025,842. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Trust had a net realized and unrealized gain of $135,283 on short-term investments and a net realized and unrealized gain of $161,775,834 on futures contracts. Other than the Sponsor\u2019s Fees of $7,353,186 and brokerage commissions and fees of $1,015,967, the Trust had no expenses during the year.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust\u2019s assets as of December 31, 2021 consist of Index Futures and Collateral Assets used to satisfy applicable margin requirements for those Index Futures positions. The Trust does not anticipate any further need for liquidity, because creations and redemptions of Shares generally occur in kind and ordinary expenses are met by cash on hand. Interest earned on the assets posted as collateral is paid to the Trust and is used to pay the Sponsor\u2019s Fees and purchase additional Index Futures and Collateral Assets, or, in the discretion of the Sponsor, distributed to Shareholders. For the year ended December 31, 2021, interest income was $426,034, while the Sponsor\u2019s Fees totaled $9,465,137. For the year ended December 31, 2020, interest income was $3,742,855, while the Sponsor\u2019s Fees totaled $5,005,767. For the year ended December 31, 2019, interest income was $21,394,995, while the Sponsor\u2019s Fees totaled $7,353,186. In exchange for a fee based on the net asset value of the Trust, the Sponsor has assumed most of the ordinary expenses incurred by the Trust. In the case of an extraordinary expense and/or insufficient interest income to cover ordinary expenses, however, the Trust could be forced to liquidate its positions in Index Futures and Collateral Assets to pay such expenses. As of December 31, 2021, the market for Index Futures had not developed significant liquidity and the Trust represented substantially all of the long-side open interest in Index Futures. In addition, it is expected that Goldman Sachs or its accountholders may represent, directly or indirectly, a substantial portion of the short-side interest in such market.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe existence of such a limited number of market participants could cause or exacerbate losses to the Trust if the Trust were required to liquidate its Index Futures positions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Sponsor is unaware of any other trends, demands, conditions or events that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to the Trust\u2019s liquidity needs.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBecause the Trust trades Index Futures, its capital is at risk due to changes in the value of the Index Futures or other assets (market risk) or the inability of counterparties to perform (credit risk).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMarket Risk\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust holds Index Futures positions and Collateral Assets to satisfy applicable margin requirements on those Index Futures positions. Because of this limited diversification of the Trust\u2019s assets, fluctuations in the value of the Index Futures are expected to directly affect the value of the Shares. The value of the Index Futures is expected to track generally the S&P GSCI-ER, although this correlation may not be exact. The S&P GSCI-ER, in turn, reflects the value of a diversified group of commodities. The Trust\u2019s exposure to market risk will be influenced by a number of factors, including the lack of liquidity of the Index Futures market and activities of other market participants.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCredit Risk\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhen the Trust purchases or holds Index Futures, it is exposed to the credit risk of a default by the CME\u2019s clearing house, which serves as the counterparty to each Index Futures position, and of a default by its futures commission merchant, or Clearing FCM. In the case of such a default, the Trust may be unable to recover amounts due to it on its Index Futures positions and Collateral Assets posted as margin. The Trust is also exposed to credit risk as a result of its ownership of U.S. Treasury bills.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust does not use and is not expected to use special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The Trust does not have and is not expected to have loan guarantee arrangements or other off-balance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business, which may include indemnification provisions related to certain risks service providers undertake in performing services that are in the interest of the Trust. While the Trust\u2019s exposure under such indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these general business indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the Trust\u2019s financial position.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements relies on estimates and assumptions that impact the Trust\u2019s financial position and results of operations. These estimates and assumptions affect the Trust\u2019s application of accounting policies. In addition, please refer to Note 2 to the financial statements of the Trust for further discussion of the Trust\u2019s accounting policies.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       29\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "item7a": ">Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nQuantitative Disclosure\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust is exposed to commodity price risk through the Trust\u2019s holdings of Index Futures. The following table provides information about the Trust\u2019s futures contract positions, which are sensitive to changes in commodity prices. As of December 31, 2021, the Trust\u2019s open Index Futures long positions were as follows:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNumber of contracts\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n56,436\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExpiration date\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \nMarch 2022\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWeighted-average price per contract\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n246.95\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNotional amount (fair value)\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,430,714,680\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe notional amount is calculated using the settlement price for the Index Futures on the CME on December 31, 2021, which was $253.51 per contract, and the $100 multiplier applicable under the contract terms.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust has non-trading market risk as\u00a0a result of investing in short-term United States Treasury bills and such market risk is expected to be immaterial.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nQualitative Disclosure\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs described herein, the Trust seeks to track the results of a fully collateralized investment in futures contracts on an index composed of a diversified group of commodity futures. The Trust seeks to track the investment returns of the Index before payment of the Trust\u2019s expenses and liabilities. The Index itself is intended to reflect the performance of a diversified group of physical commodities, including energy commodities, precious and industrial metal commodities, agricultural commodities and livestock commodities. The Trust obtains this exposure to commodity prices through the Trust\u2019s Index Futures positions. As a result, fluctuations in the value of the Trust\u2019s Index Futures are expected to directly affect the value of the Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust will not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from, or ameliorate losses caused by, changes in the level of the Index or the S&P GSCI-ER, or the value of any Collateral Assets. The Trust\u2019s exposure to market risk may be influenced by a number of factors, including the lack of liquidity of the Index Futures market and activities of other market participants.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "companyName": "iShares S&P GSCI Commodity-Indexed Trust", "cusip": "464287168"}
