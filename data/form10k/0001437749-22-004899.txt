{"item1": ">Item 1. Business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe purpose of the iShares Gold Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d) is to own gold transferred to the Trust in exchange for shares issued by the Trust (\u201cShares\u201d). Each Share represents a fractional undivided beneficial interest in the net assets of the Trust. The assets of the Trust consist primarily of gold held by the Trust\u2019s custodian on behalf of the Trust. However, there may be situations where the Trust will unexpectedly hold cash. For example, a claim may arise against a third party, which is settled in cash. In situations where the Trust unexpectedly receives cash or other assets, no new Shares will be issued until after the record date for the distribution of such cash or other property has passed.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust was formed on January 21, 2005 when an initial deposit of gold was made in exchange for the issuance of three Baskets (a \u201cBasket\u201d consists of 50,000 Shares). The Trust is a grantor trust formed under the laws of the State of New York.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe sponsor of the Trust is iShares Delaware Trust Sponsor LLC (the \u201cSponsor\u201d), a Delaware limited liability company and an indirect subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (\u201cBlackRock\u201d). The trustee of the Trust is The Bank of New York Mellon (the \u201cTrustee\u201d) and the custodian of the Trust is JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., London branch (the \u201cCustodian\u201d). The agreement between the Trust and the Custodian is governed by English law. The Trust does not have any officers, directors or employees.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust\u2019s net asset value decreased from $31,918,269,136 at December 31, 2020 to $28,723,023,637 at December 31, 2021, the Trust\u2019s fiscal year end. Outstanding Shares of the Trust fell from 885,225,000\n(a) \nShares outstanding at December 31, 2020 to 829,750,000 Shares outstanding at December\u00a031,\u00a02021.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe activities of the Trust are limited to (1) issuing Baskets in exchange for the gold deposited with the Custodian as consideration, (2) selling gold as necessary to cover the Sponsor\u2019s fee, Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor and other liabilities, and (3) delivering gold in exchange for Baskets surrendered for redemption. The Trust is not actively managed. It does not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from, or to ameliorate losses caused by, changes in the price of gold.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Sponsor of the Trust maintains a website at www.ishares.com, through which the Trust\u2019s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), are made available free of charge after they have been filed or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d). Additional information regarding the Trust may also be found on the SEC\u2019s EDGAR database at www.sec.gov.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTrust Objective\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of gold. The Trust seeks to reflect such performance before payment of the Trust\u2019s expenses and liabilities. The Shares are intended to constitute a simple and cost-effective means of making an investment similar to an investment in gold. An investment in physical gold requires expensive and sometimes complicated arrangements in connection with the assay, transportation, warehousing and insurance of the metal. Traditionally, such expense and complications have resulted in investments in physical gold being efficient only in amounts beyond the reach of many investors. The Shares have been designed to remove the obstacles represented by the expense and complications involved in an investment in physical gold, while at the same time having an intrinsic value that reflects, at any given time, the price of the gold owned by the Trust at such time, less the Trust\u2019s expenses and liabilities. Although the Shares are not the exact equivalent of an investment in gold, they provide investors with an alternative that allows a level of participation in the gold market through the securities market.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAn investment in Shares is:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBacked by gold held by the Custodian on behalf of the Trust.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Shares are backed by the assets of the Trust. The Trustee\u2019s arrangements with the Custodian contemplate that at the end of each business day there can be in the Trust account maintained by the Custodian no gold in an unallocated form. The Trust\u2019s gold holdings are represented by physical gold, are identified on the Custodian\u2019s or, if applicable, sub-custodian\u2019s, books as the property of the Trust, and are held by the Custodian in New York, London and other locations that may be authorized in the future.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs accessible and easy to handle as any other investment in shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRetail investors may purchase and sell Shares through traditional brokerage accounts. Because the intrinsic value of each Share is a function of the price of only a fraction of an ounce of gold held by the Trust, the cash outlay necessary for an investment in Shares should be less than the amount required for currently existing means of investing in physical gold. Shares are eligible for margin accounts.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nListed.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Shares are listed and trade on NYSE Arca, Inc. (\u201cNYSE Arca\u201d) under the ticker symbol IAU.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n(a)\n \n\n\n \nAdjusted to reflect a one-for-two reverse stock split that was effective at market open on May 24, 2021.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n     1\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRelatively cost-efficient.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBecause the expenses involved in an investment in physical gold are dispersed among all holders of Shares, an investment in Shares may represent a cost-efficient alternative to investments in physical gold for investors not otherwise in a position to participate directly in the market for physical gold.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSecondary Market Trading\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhile the Trust seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of gold less the Trust\u2019s expenses and liabilities, Shares may trade at, above or below their net asset value per Share (the \u201cNAV\u201d). The NAV of the Shares will fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Trust\u2019s assets. The trading prices of Shares will fluctuate in accordance with changes in their NAV, as well as market supply and demand. The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the NAV may be influenced by non-concurrent trading hours between the major gold markets and NYSE Arca. While the Shares trade on NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. (New York time), liquidity in the market for gold may be reduced after the close of the major world gold markets, including London, Zurich and the Commodity Exchange, Inc. (\u201cCOMEX\u201d) in Chicago. As a result, during this time, trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount, on Shares may widen. However, given that Baskets can be created and redeemed in exchange for the underlying amount of gold, the Sponsor believes that the arbitrage opportunities may provide a mechanism to mitigate the effect of such premium or discount.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust is not registered as an investment company for purposes of U.S. federal securities laws, and is not subject to regulation by the SEC as an investment company. Consequently, the owners of Shares do not have the regulatory protections provided to investors in registered investment companies. For example, the provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d), that limit transactions with affiliates, prohibit the suspension of redemptions (except under certain limited circumstances) or limit sales loads, among others, do not apply to the Trust.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust does not hold or trade in commodity futures contracts or any other instruments regulated by the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act (the \u201cCEA\u201d), as administered by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d). Furthermore, the Trust is not a commodity pool for purposes of the CEA. Consequently, the Trustee and the Sponsor are not subject to registration as commodity pool operators with respect to the Trust. The owners of Shares do not receive the CEA disclosure document and certified annual report required to be delivered by the registered commodity pool operator with respect to a commodity pool, and the owners of Shares do not have the regulatory protections provided to investors in commodity pools operated by registered commodity pool operators.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCustody of the Trust\n\u2019\ns Gold\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Custodian is responsible for safekeeping the Trust\u2019s gold. The Custodian may keep the Trust\u2019s gold at locations in New York, Toronto or London, or with the consent of the Trustee and the Sponsor, in other places. The Custodian may, at its own expense and risk, use sub-custodians to discharge its obligations to the Trust. The Custodian will remain responsible to the Trust for any gold held by any sub-custodian appointed by the Custodian to the same extent as if such gold were held by the Custodian itself.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Custodian has agreed to use reasonable care in the performance of its duties to the Trust, and will only be responsible for any loss or damage suffered by the Trust as a direct result of the Custodian\u2019s negligence, fraud or willful default in the performance of its duties. The Custodian\u2019s liability is limited to the value of any gold lost, or the amount of any balance held on an unallocated basis, at the time of the Custodian\u2019s negligence, fraud or willful default.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNone of the Custodian, or its directors, employees, agents or affiliates will incur any liability to the Trust if, by reason of any law or regulation, or of an act of God, terrorism or other circumstance beyond the Custodian\u2019s control, the Custodian is prevented or forbidden from, or delayed in, performing its obligations to the Trust. The Custodian has agreed to indemnify the Trustee for any loss or liability directly resulting from a breach of the Custodian\u2019s representations and warranties in the custodian agreement between the Trustee and the Custodian (the \u201cCustodian Agreement\u201d), a failure of the Custodian to act in accordance with the Trustee\u2019s instructions or any physical loss, destruction or damage to the gold held for the Trust\u2019s account, except for losses due to nuclear fission or fusion, radioactivity, war, terrorist event, invasion, insurrection, civil commotion, riot, strike, act of government or public authority, act of God, or a similar cause that is beyond the control of the Custodian for which the Custodian will not be responsible to the Trust.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Custodian has agreed to maintain insurance in support of its custodial obligations under the Custodian Agreement, including covering any loss of gold. The Custodian has the right to reduce, cancel or allow to expire without replacement such insurance coverage, provided that it gives prior written notice to the Trustee. In the case of a cancellation or expiration without replacement, the required notice must be at least 30 days prior to the last day of coverage. The Trustee has not received from the Custodian any notice of reduction, cancellation or expiration of its insurance coverage. The insurance is held for the benefit of the Custodian, not for the benefit of the Trust or the Trustee, and the Trustee may not submit a claim under the insurance maintained by the Custodian.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Custodian has agreed to grant to the officers and properly designated representatives of the Trustee and to the independent public accountants for the Trust access to the Custodian\u2019s records for the purpose of confirming the content of those records. Upon at least ten days\u2019 prior notice, any such officer or properly designated representative, any independent public accountants for the Trust and any person designated by any regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the Trustee or the Trust is entitled to examine on the Custodian\u2019s premises the gold held by the Custodian and the records regarding the gold held for the account of the Custodian at a sub-custodian. The Custodian has agreed that it will only retain sub-custodians if they agree to grant to the Trustee and the independent registered public accounting firm of the Trust access to records and inspection rights similar to those set forth above. During the period covered by this report, Inspectorate America Corporation and Inspectorate International Ltd., acting as authorized representatives of the Trustee pursuant to the foregoing provisions, inspected on two separate occasions the premises where the Trust\u2019s gold is warehoused and on April 16, 2021 and December 14, 2021 issued their reports summarizing their findings. Such reports are posted by the Sponsor on the Trust\u2019s website.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n     2\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nValuation of Gold\n\u037e\n Computation of Net Asset Value\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn each business day, as soon as practicable after 4:00 p.m. (New York time), the Trustee evaluates the gold held by the Trust and determines the net asset value of the Trust and the NAV. For purposes of making these calculations, a business day means any day other than a day when NYSE Arca is closed for regular trading.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trustee values the gold held by the Trust using that day\u2019s London Bullion Market Association (\u201cLBMA\u201d) Gold Price PM.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLBMA Gold Price is the price per troy ounce, in U.S. dollars, of unallocated gold delivered in London determined by ICE Benchmark Administration (\u201cIBA\u201d) following an electronic auction consisting of one or more 30-second rounds starting at 10:30 a.m. (London time) (in the case of LBMA Gold Price AM) or 3:00 p.m. (London time) (in the case of LBMA Gold Price PM) on each day that the London gold market is open for business, and published shortly thereafter. At the start of each round of auction, IBA publishes a price for that round. Participants then have 30 seconds to enter, change or cancel their orders (i.e., how much gold they want to buy or sell at that price). At the end of each round, order entry is frozen, and the system checks to see if the imbalance (i.e., the difference between buying and selling) is within the threshold (normally 10,000 troy ounces for gold). If the imbalance is outside the threshold at the end of a round, then the auction is not balanced, the price is adjusted and a new round starts. If the imbalance is within the threshold then the auction is finished, and the price is set as the LBMA Gold Price AM or LBMA Gold Price PM, as appropriate, for that day. Any imbalance is shared equally between all direct participants (even if they did not place orders or did not log in), and the net volume for each participant trades at the final price. The prices during the auction are determined by an algorithm that takes into account current market conditions and activity in the auction. Each auction is actively supervised by IBA staff. As of the date of this report, information publicly available on IBA\u2019s website indicates that the direct participants currently qualified to submit orders during the electronic auctions used for the daily determination of the LBMA Gold Price are Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Citibank, N.A. London Branch, Coins \u2018N\u2019\u00a0Things Inc., DRW Investments, LLC, Goldman Sachs International plc, HSBC Bank USA NA, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), StoneX Financial Ltd, Jane Street Global Trading, LLC, JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. London Branch, Koch Supply and Trading LP, Marex Financial Limited, Morgan Stanley, Standard Chartered Bank, and Toronto-Dominion Bank.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf there is no LBMA Gold Price PM on any day, the Trustee is authorized to use the most recently announced LBMA Gold Price AM unless the Trustee, in consultation with the Sponsor, determines that such price is inappropriate as a basis for evaluation. Once the value of the Trust\u2019s gold has been determined, the Trustee subtracts all accrued fees, expenses and other liabilities of the Trust from the total value of the gold and all other assets of the Trust. The resulting figure is the net asset value of the Trust. The Trustee determines the NAV by dividing the net asset value of the Trust by the number of Shares outstanding on the day the computation is made.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTrust Expenses\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust\u2019s only ordinary recurring expense is expected to be the Sponsor\u2019s fee. In exchange for the Sponsor\u2019s fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume the following administrative and marketing expenses incurred by the Trust: the Trustee\u2019s fee, the Custodian\u2019s fee, NYSE Arca listing fees, SEC registration fees, printing and mailing costs, audit fees and expenses, and up to $100,000 per annum in legal fees and expenses.\u00a0Effective January 31, 2022 the Sponsor has agreed to assume up to $500,000 per annum in legal fees and expenses. The Sponsor may determine in its sole discretion to assume legal fees and expenses of the Trust in excess of the amount required under the Trust Agreement. To the extent that the Sponsor does not voluntarily assume such fees and expenses, they will be the responsibility of the Trust.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Sponsor\u2019s fee is accrued daily at an annualized rate equal to 0.25% of the net asset value of the Trust and is payable monthly in arrears. The Trustee will, when directed by the Sponsor, and, in the absence of such direction, may, in its discretion, sell gold in such quantity and at such times, as may be necessary to permit payment of the Sponsor\u2019s fee and of Trust expenses or liabilities not assumed by the Sponsor. The Trustee is authorized to sell gold at such times and in the smallest amounts required to permit such payments as they become due, it being the intention to avoid or minimize the Trust\u2019s holdings of assets other than gold. Accordingly, the amount of gold to be sold will vary from time to time depending on the level of the Trust\u2019s expenses and the market price of gold. The Custodian has agreed to purchase from the Trust, at the request of the Trustee, gold needed to cover Trust expenses at a price equal to the price used by the Trustee to determine the value of the gold held by the Trust on the date of the sale. Cash held by the Trustee pending payment of the Trust\u2019s expenses will not bear any interest.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Sponsor earned $72,773,331 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Each sale of gold by the Trust will be a taxable event to Shareholders. See \u201cUnited States Federal Income Tax Consequences --Taxation of U.S. Shareholders.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDeposit of Gold\n\u037e\n Issuance of Baskets\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust issues and redeems Shares on a continuous basis but only in Baskets of 50,000 Shares. Only registered broker-dealers who have entered into written agreements with the Sponsor and the Trustee (each, an \u201cAuthorized Participant\u201d) can deposit gold and receive Baskets in exchange. Upon the deposit of the corresponding amount of gold with the Custodian, and the payment of the Trustee\u2019s applicable fee and of any expenses, taxes or charges (such as stamp taxes or stock transfer taxes or fees), the Trustee will deliver the appropriate number of Baskets to the Depository Trust Company account of the depositing Authorized Participant. As of the date of this report, ABN AMRO Clearing Chicago LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA), LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman Sachs & Co., HSBC Securities (USA) LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc., Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Scotia Capital (USA) Inc., UBS Securities LLC, Virtu Americas LLC and Virtu Financial BD LLC are the only Authorized Participants. The Sponsor and the Trustee maintain a current list of Authorized Participants. Gold deposited with the Custodian must meet the specifications for weight, dimensions, fineness (or purity), identifying marks and appearance of gold bars and as of January\u00a01,\u00a02020, must be produced by refiners that meet certain throughput and tangible net worth requirements as set forth in \u201cGood Delivery List Rules - Conditions for Listing for Good Delivery Refiners\u201d published by the LBMA.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n     3\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBefore making a deposit, the Authorized Participant must deliver to the Trustee a written purchase order, or submit a purchase order through the Trustee\u2019s electronic order entry system, indicating the number of Baskets it intends to acquire and the location or locations where it expects to make the corresponding deposit of gold with the Custodian. The Trustee will acknowledge the purchase order unless it or the Sponsor decides to refuse the deposit. The date the Trustee receives that order determines the amount of gold the Authorized Participant needs to deposit (such amount, the \u201cBasket Gold Amount\u201d). However, orders received by the Trustee after 3:59 p.m. (New York time) on a business day will not be accepted and should be resubmitted on the next following business day. The Trustee has entered into an agreement with the Custodian which contains arrangements so that gold can be delivered to the Custodian in New York, Toronto, London or at other locations that may be authorized in the future.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf the Trustee accepts the purchase order, it transmits to the Authorized Participant, via facsimile or electronic mail message, no later than 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on the date such purchase order is received, or deemed received, a copy of the purchase order endorsed \u201cAccepted\u201d by the Trustee and indicating the Basket Gold Amount that the Authorized Participant must deliver to the Custodian in exchange for each Basket. In the case of purchase orders submitted via the Trustee\u2019s electronic order system, the Authorized Participant will receive an automated email indicating the acceptance of the purchase order and the purchase order will be marked \u201cAccepted\u201d in the Trustee\u2019s electronic order system. Prior to the Trustee\u2019s acceptance as specified above, a purchase order only represents the Authorized Participant\u2019s unilateral offer to deposit gold in exchange for Baskets and has no binding effect upon the Trust, the Trustee, the Custodian or any other party.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Basket Gold Amount necessary for the creation of a Basket changes from day to day. At the creation of the Trust, the initial Basket Gold Amount was 5,000 ounces of gold. On each day that NYSE Arca is open for regular trading, the Trustee adjusts the quantity of gold constituting the Basket Gold Amount as appropriate to reflect sales of gold, any loss of gold that may occur, and accrued expenses. The computation is made by the Trustee as promptly as practicable after 4:00 p.m. (New York time). See \u201cValuation of Gold\u037e Computation of Net Asset Value\u201d for a description of how the LBMA Gold Price PM is determined, and description of how the Trustee determines the NAV. The Trustee determines the Basket Gold Amount for a given day by multiplying the NAV by the number of Shares in each Basket (50,000) and dividing the resulting product by that day\u2019s LBMA Gold Price PM. Fractions of a fine ounce of gold smaller than 0.001 fine ounce are disregarded for purposes of the computation of the Basket Gold Amount. The Basket Gold Amount so determined is communicated via facsimile or electronic mail message to all Authorized Participants, and made available on the Sponsor\u2019s website for the Shares. NYSE Arca also publishes the Basket Gold Amount determined by the Trustee as indicated above.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBecause the Sponsor has assumed what are expected to be most of the Trust\u2019s expenses and the Sponsor\u2019s fee accrues daily at the same rate, in the absence of any extraordinary expenses or liabilities, the amount of gold by which the Basket Gold Amount decreases each day is predictable. The Trustee intends to make available on each business day through the same channels used to disseminate the actual Basket Gold Amount determined by the Trustee as indicated above an indicative Basket Gold Amount for the next business day. Authorized Participants may use that indicative Basket Gold Amount as guidance regarding the amount of gold that they may expect to have to deposit with the Custodian in respect of purchase orders placed by them on such next business day and accepted by the Trustee. The agreement entered into with each Authorized Participant provides, however, that once a purchase order has been accepted by the Trustee, the Authorized Participant will be required to deposit with the Custodian the Basket Gold Amount determined by the Trustee on the effective date of the purchase order.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNo Shares are issued unless and until the Custodian has informed the Trustee that it has allocated to the Trust\u2019s account the corresponding amount of gold.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRedemption of Baskets\n\u037e\n Withdrawal of Gold\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAuthorized Participants, acting on authority of the registered holder of Shares, may surrender Baskets in exchange for the corresponding Basket Gold Amount announced by the Trustee. Upon the surrender of such Shares and the payment of the Trustee\u2019s applicable fee and of any expenses, taxes or charges (such as stamp taxes or stock transfer taxes or fees), the Trustee will deliver to the order of the redeeming Authorized Participant the amount of gold corresponding to the redeemed Baskets. Shares can only be surrendered for redemption in Baskets of 50,000 Shares each.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBefore surrendering Baskets for redemption, an Authorized Participant must deliver to the Trustee a written request, or submit a redemption order through the Trustee\u2019s electronic order entry system, indicating the number of Baskets it intends to redeem. The date the Trustee receives that order determines the Basket Gold Amount to be received in exchange. However, orders received by the Trustee after 3:59 p.m. (New York time) on a business day will not be accepted and should be resubmitted on the next following business day.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Custodian may make the gold available for collection at its office or at the office of a sub-custodian if the gold is being held by a sub-custodian.

This is based on the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and judicial and administrative interpretations of the Code, all as in effect on the date of this report and all of which are subject to change either prospectively or retroactively. The tax treatment of owners of beneficial interests in the Shares (\u201cShareholders\u201d) may vary depending upon their own particular circumstances. Certain Shareholders (including banks, financial institutions, insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, broker-dealers, traders, Shareholders that are partnerships for United States federal income tax purposes, persons holding Shares as a position in a \u201chedging,\u201d \u201cstraddle,\u201d \u201cconversion,\u201d or \u201cconstructive sale\u201d transaction for United States federal income tax purposes, persons whose \u201cfunctional currency\u201d is not the U.S. dollar, or other investors with special circumstances) may be subject to special rules not discussed below. In addition, the following discussion applies only to investors who will hold Shares as \u201ccapital assets\u201d within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code. Moreover, the discussion below does not address the effect of any state, local or foreign tax law on an owner of Shares. Purchasers of Shares are urged to consult their own tax advisers with respect to all federal, state, local and foreign tax law considerations potentially applicable to their investment in Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor purposes of this discussion, a \u201cU.S. Shareholder\u201d is a Shareholder that is:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nan individual who is treated as a citizen or resident of the United States for United States federal income tax purposes\u037e\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \na corporation (or entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia\u037e\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nan estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for United States federal income tax purposes regardless of its source\u037e or\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \na trust, if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or a trust that has made a valid election under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a domestic trust.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA Shareholder that is not (1) a U.S. Shareholder as defined above or (2) a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes, is considered a \u201cNon\u2011U.S. Shareholder\u201d for purposes of this discussion.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n     5\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTaxation of the Trust\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Sponsor and the Trustee will treat the Trust as a grantor trust for United States federal income tax purposes. In the opinion of Clifford Chance US LLP, special United States federal income tax counsel to the Sponsor, the Trust will be classified as a grantor trust for United States federal income tax purposes. As a result, the Trust itself will not be subject to United States federal income tax. Instead, the Trust\u2019s income and expenses will flow through to the Shareholders, and the Trustee will report the Trust\u2019s income, gains, losses and deductions to the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) on that basis. The opinion of Clifford Chance US LLP represents only its best legal judgment and is not binding on the IRS or any court. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with the conclusions of counsel\u2019s opinion and it is possible that the IRS or another tax authority could assert a position contrary to one or all of those conclusions and that a court could sustain that contrary position. Neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee will request a ruling from the IRS with respect to the classification of the Trust for United States federal income tax purposes. If the IRS were to assert successfully that the Trust is not classified as a grantor trust, the Trust would be classified as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes, which may affect timing and other tax consequences to the Shareholders.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe following discussion assumes that the Trust will be classified as a grantor trust for United States federal income tax purposes.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTaxation of U.S. Shareholders\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nShareholders will be treated, for United States federal income tax purposes, as if they directly owned a pro rata share of the underlying assets held in the Trust. Shareholders also will be treated as if they directly received their respective pro rata shares of the Trust\u2019s income, if any, and as if they directly incurred their respective pro rata shares of the Trust\u2019s expenses. In the case of a Shareholder that purchases Shares for cash, its initial tax basis in its pro rata share of the assets held in the Trust at the time it acquires its Shares will be equal to its cost of acquiring the Shares. In the case of a Shareholder that acquires its Shares as part of a creation of a Basket, the delivery of gold to the Trust in exchange for the underlying gold represented by the Shares will not be a taxable event to the Shareholder, and the Shareholder\u2019s tax basis and holding period for the Shareholder\u2019s pro rata share of the gold held in the Trust will be the same as its tax basis and holding period for the gold delivered in exchange therefor. For purposes of this discussion, and unless stated otherwise, it is assumed that all of a Shareholder\u2019s Shares are acquired on the same date and at the same price per Share. Shareholders that hold multiple lots of Shares, or that are contemplating acquiring multiple lots of Shares, should consult their own tax advisers as to the determination of the tax basis and holding period for the underlying gold related to such Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhen the Trust sells gold, for example to pay expenses, a Shareholder will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (1) the Shareholder\u2019s pro rata share of the amount realized by the Trust upon the sale and (2) the Shareholder\u2019s tax basis for its pro rata share of the gold that was sold. A Shareholder\u2019s tax basis for its share of any gold sold by the Trust generally will be determined by multiplying the Shareholder\u2019s total basis for its share of all of the gold held in the Trust immediately prior to the sale, by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of gold sold, and the denominator of which is the total amount of the gold held in the Trust immediately prior to the sale. After any such sale, a Shareholder\u2019s tax basis for its pro rata share of the gold remaining in the Trust will be equal to its tax basis for its share of the total amount of the gold held in the Trust immediately prior to the sale, less the portion of such basis allocable to its share of the gold that was sold. The delivery to the Trust of gold in specified denominations (e.g., COMEX gold in denominations of 100 ounces) and the subsequent delivery by the Trust of gold in different denominations (e.g., LBMA gold in denominations of 400 ounces) will not constitute a taxable event.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUpon a Shareholder\u2019s sale of some or all of its Shares, the Shareholder will be treated as having sold the portion of its pro rata share of the gold held in the Trust at the time of the sale that is attributable to the Shares sold. Accordingly, the Shareholder generally will recognize gain or loss on the sale in an amount equal to the difference between (1) the amount realized pursuant to the sale of the Shares and (2) the Shareholder\u2019s tax basis for the portion of its pro rata share of the gold held in the Trust at the time of sale that is attributable to the Shares sold, as determined in the manner described in the preceding paragraph.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA redemption of some or all of a Shareholder\u2019s Shares in exchange for the underlying gold represented by the Shares redeemed generally will not be a taxable event to the Shareholder. In addition, a Shareholder that acquires its Shares as part of a creation of a Basket by the delivery to the Trust of gold in specified denominations (e.g., COMEX gold in denominations of 100 ounces), the subsequent redemption of its Shares for gold delivered by the Trust in different denominations (e.g., LBMA gold in denominations of 400 ounces) will not constitute a taxable event, provided that the amount of gold received upon redemption contains the equivalent metallic content of the gold delivered upon creation, less amounts accrued or sold to pay the Trust\u2019s expenses and other charges. The Shareholder\u2019s tax basis for the gold received in the redemption generally will be the same as the Shareholder\u2019s tax basis for the portion of its pro rata share of the gold held in the Trust immediately prior to the redemption that is attributable to the Shares redeemed. The Shareholder\u2019s holding period with respect to the gold received should include the period during which the Shareholder held the Shares redeemed. A subsequent sale of the gold received by the Shareholder will be a taxable event.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAfter any sale or redemption of less than all of a Shareholder\u2019s Shares, the Shareholder\u2019s tax basis for its pro rata share of the gold held in the Trust immediately after such sale or redemption generally will be equal to its tax basis for its share of the total amount of the gold held in the Trust immediately prior to the sale or redemption, less the portion of such basis which is taken into account in determining the amount of gain or loss recognized by the Shareholder upon such sale or, in the case of a redemption, is treated as the basis of the gold received by the Shareholder in the redemption.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n     6\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMaximum 28% Long-Term Capital Gains Tax Rate for U.S. Shareholders Who Are Individuals\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnder current law, gains recognized by individuals from the sale of \u201ccollectibles\u201d, including gold, held for more than one year are taxed at a maximum rate of 28%, rather than the current maximum 20% rate applicable to most other long-term capital gains. For these purposes, gain recognized by an individual upon the sale of an interest in a trust that holds collectibles is treated as gain recognized on the sale of collectibles, to the extent that the gain is attributable to unrealized appreciation in value of the collectibles held by the Trust. Therefore, any gain recognized by an individual U.S. Shareholder attributable to a sale of Shares held for more than one year, or attributable to the Trust\u2019s sale of any gold which the Shareholder is treated (through its ownership of Shares) as having held for more than one year, generally will be taxed at a maximum rate of 28%. The tax rates for capital gains recognized upon the sale of assets held by an individual U.S. Shareholder for one year or less or by a taxpayer other than an individual United States taxpayer are generally the same as those at which ordinary income is taxed.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3.8% Tax on Net Investment Income\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCertain U.S. Shareholders who are individuals are required to pay a 3.8% tax on the lesser of the excess of their modified adjusted gross income over a threshold amount ($250,000 for married persons filing jointly and $200,000 for single taxpayers) or their \u201cnet investment income\u201d, which generally includes capital gains from the disposition of property. This tax is in addition to any capital gains taxes due on such investment income. A similar tax will apply to estates and trusts. U.S. Shareholders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the effect, if any, this law may have on their investment in the Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBrokerage Fees and Trust Expenses\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAny brokerage or other transaction fee incurred by a Shareholder in purchasing Shares will be treated as part of the Shareholder\u2019s tax basis in the underlying assets of the Trust. Similarly, any brokerage fee incurred by a Shareholder in selling Shares will reduce the amount realized by the Shareholder with respect to the sale.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nShareholders will be required to recognize the full amount of gain or loss upon a sale of gold by the Trust (as discussed above), even though some or all of the proceeds of such sale are used by the Trustee to pay Trust expenses. Shareholders may deduct their respective pro rata shares of each expense incurred by the Trust to the same extent as if they directly incurred the expense. Shareholders who are individuals, estates or trusts, or certain closely held corporations, however, may be subject to various limitations on their ability to use their allocable share of the Trust\u2019s deductions and losses. Prospective Shareholders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the United States federal income tax consequences of holding Shares in light of their particular circumstance.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInvestment by U.S. Tax-Exempt Shareholders\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCertain U.S. Shareholders (\u201cU.S. Tax-Exempt Shareholders\u201d) are subject to United States federal income tax only on their unrelated business taxable income (\u201cUBTI\u201d). Unless they incur debt in order to purchase Shares, it is expected that U.S. Tax-Exempt Shareholders should not realize UBTI in respect of income or gains from the Shares. U.S. Tax-Exempt Shareholders should consult their own independent tax advisers regarding the United States federal income tax consequences of holding Shares in light of their particular circumstances.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInvestment by Regulated Investment Companies\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMutual funds and other investment vehicles which are \u201cregulated investment companies\u201d within the meaning of Code Section 851 should consult with their tax advisers concerning (1) the likelihood that an investment in Shares, although they are a \u201csecurity\u201d within the meaning of the Investment Company Act, may be considered an investment in the underlying gold for purposes of Code Section 851(b) and (2) the extent to which an investment in Shares might nevertheless be consistent with preservation of their qualification under Code Section 851.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInvestment by Certain Retirement Plans\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSection 408(m) of the Code provides that the purchase of a \u201ccollectible\u201d as an investment for an individual retirement account (\u201cIRA\u201d), or for a participant\u2011directed account maintained under any plan that is tax-qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, is treated as a taxable distribution from the account to the owner of the IRA, or to the participant for whom the plan account is maintained, of an amount equal to the cost to the account of acquiring the collectible. The Trust has received a private letter ruling from the IRS which provides that the purchase of Shares by an IRA or a participant-directed account maintained under a plan that is tax-qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, will not constitute the acquisition of a collectible or be treated as resulting in a taxable distribution to the IRA owner or plan participant under Code Section 408(m). However, in the event any redemption of Shares results in the distribution of gold bullion to an IRA or a participant-directed account maintained under a plan that is tax-qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, such distribution would constitute the acquisition of a collectible to the extent provided under Section 408(m) of the Code. See \u201cERISA and Related Considerations.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTaxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA Non-U.S. Shareholder generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax with respect to gain recognized upon the sale or other disposition of Shares, or upon the sale of gold by the Trust, unless (1) the Non-U.S. Shareholder is an individual and is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the sale or other disposition, and the gain is treated as being from United States sources or (2) the gain is effectively connected with the conduct by the Non-U.S. Shareholder of a trade or business in the United States and certain other conditions are met.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n     7\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnited States Information Reporting and Backup Withholding\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trustee will file certain information returns with the IRS, and provide certain tax-related information to Shareholders, in connection with the Trust. Each Shareholder will be provided with information regarding its allocable portion of the Trust\u2019s annual income (if any) and expenses. A U.S. Shareholder may be subject to United States backup withholding tax in certain circumstances unless it provides its taxpayer identification number and complies with certain certification procedures. Non-U.S. Shareholders may have to comply with certification procedures to establish that they are not a United States person in order to avoid the information reporting and backup withholding tax requirements.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe amount of any backup withholding will be allowed as a credit against a Shareholder\u2019s United States federal income tax liability and may entitle such a Shareholder to a refund, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS in a timely manner.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTaxation in Jurisdictions Other Than the United States\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nProspective purchasers of Shares that are based in or acting out of a jurisdiction other than the United States are advised to consult their own tax advisers as to the tax consequences, under the laws of such jurisdiction (or any other jurisdiction other than the United States to which they are subject), of their purchase, holding, sale and redemption of or any other dealing in Shares and, in particular, as to whether any value added tax, other consumption tax or transfer tax is payable in relation to such purchase, holding, sale, redemption or other dealing.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nERISA AND RELATED CONSIDERATIONS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d) and/or Section 4975 of the Code impose certain requirements on: (i) employee benefit plans and certain other plans and arrangements, including individual retirement accounts and annuities, Keogh plans and certain collective investment funds or insurance company general or separate accounts in which such plans or arrangements are invested, that are subject to Title I of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code (collectively, \u201cPlans\u201d)\u037e and (ii) persons who are fiduciaries with respect to the investment of assets treated as \u201cplan assets\u201d within the meaning of U.S. Department of Labor (\u201cDOL\u201d) regulation 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA (the \u201cPlan Assets Regulation\u201d), of a Plan. Investments by Plans are subject to the fiduciary requirements and the applicability of prohibited transaction restrictions under ERISA and the Code.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cGovernmental plans\u201d within the meaning of Section 3(32) of ERISA, certain \u201cchurch plans\u201d within the meaning of Section 3(33) of ERISA and \u201cnon-U.S. plans\u201d described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA, while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, may be subject to any federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other law or regulation that is substantially similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA and the Code. Fiduciaries of any such plans are advised to consult with their counsel prior to an investment in the Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn contemplating an investment of a portion of Plan assets in the Shares, the Plan fiduciary responsible for making such investment should carefully consider, taking into account the facts and circumstances of the Plan, the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d discussed below and whether such investment is consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities. The Plan fiduciary should consider, among other issues, whether: (1) the fiduciary has the authority to make the investment under the appropriate governing plan instrument\u037e (2) the investment would constitute a direct or indirect non-exempt prohibited transaction with a \u201cparty in interest\u201d or a \u201cdisqualified person\u201d within the meaning of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code respectively\u037e (3) the investment is in accordance with the Plan\u2019s funding objectives\u037e and (4) such investment is appropriate for the Plan under the general fiduciary standards of investment prudence and diversification, taking into account the overall investment policy of the Plan, the composition of the Plan\u2019s investment portfolio and the Plan\u2019s need for sufficient liquidity to pay benefits when due. When evaluating the prudence of an investment in the Shares, the Plan fiduciary should consider the DOL\u2019s regulation on investment duties, which can be found at 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2550.404a-1.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIt is intended that: (a) none of the Sponsor, the Trustee, the Custodian or any of their respective affiliates (the \u201cTransaction Parties\u201d) has through this report and related materials provided any investment advice within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA to the Plan in connection with the decision to purchase or acquire such Shares\u037e and (b) the information provided in this report and related materials will not make a Transaction Party a fiduciary to the Plan.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "item1a": ">Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to Gold\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nActual or perceived disruptions in the processes used to determine the LBMA Gold Price PM, or lack of confidence in that benchmark, may adversely affect the return on your investment in the Shares (if any).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBecause the objective of the Trust is to reflect the performance of the price of gold, any disruptions affecting the processes related to how the market determines the price of gold will have an effect on the value of the Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe LBMA Gold Price AM and LBMA Gold Price PM are gold price benchmark mechanisms administered by IBA, an independent specialist benchmark administrator appointed by the LBMA. Twice daily during London business hours, IBA hosts an electronic auction consisting of one or more 30-second rounds.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInvestors should keep in mind that electronic markets are not exempt from failures, as the experiences of the initial public offerings of Facebook and BATS Global Markets illustrate.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n     8\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs of the date of this filing, the LBMA Gold Price AM and LBMA Gold Price PM have been subjected to the test of actual trading markets for approximately five years. As with any innovation, it is possible that electronic failures or other unanticipated events may occur that could result in delays in the announcement of, or the inability of the system to produce, an LBMA Gold Price AM or LBMA Gold Price PM on any given day. In addition, if a perception were to develop that the LBMA Gold Price AM or LBMA Gold Price PM are vulnerable to manipulation attempts, or if the administration proceedings surrounding the determination and publication of the LBMA Gold Price AM or LBMA Gold Price PM were seen as unfair, biased or otherwise compromised by the markets, the behavior of investors and traders in gold may change, and those changes may have an effect on the price of gold (and, consequently, the value of the Shares). In any of these circumstances, the intervention of extraneous events disruptive of the normal interaction of supply and demand of gold at any given time may result in distorted prices and losses on an investment in the Shares that, but for such extraneous events, might not have occurred.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOther effects of disruptions in the determination of the LBMA Gold Price AM or LBMA Gold Price PM or any inaccuracies in setting of the auction prices on the operations of the Trust include the potential for an incorrect valuation of the Trust\u2019s gold, an inaccurate computation of the Sponsor\u2019s fee, and the sales of gold to cover Trust expenses at prices that do not accurately reflect the fundamentals of the gold market. Each of these events could have an adverse effect on the value of the Shares. The operation of the auction process which determines the LBMA Gold Price is also dependent on the continued operation of the LBMA and the IBA and their applicable systems.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe LBMA Gold Price AM and LBMA Gold Price PM are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom (the \u201cFCA\u201d).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs of the date of this filing, the Sponsor has no reason to believe that the LBMA Gold Price PM will not fairly represent the price of the gold held by the Trust. Should this situation change, the Sponsor expects to use the powers granted by the Trust\u2019s governing documents to seek to replace the LBMA Gold Price PM with a more reliable indicator of the value of the Trust\u2019s gold. There is no assurance that such alternative value indicator will be identified, or that the process of changing from the LBMA Gold Price PM to a new benchmark price will not adversely affect the price of the Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFuture governmental decisions may have significant impact on the price of gold, which may result in a significant decrease or increase in the value of the net assets and the net asset value of the Trust.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGenerally, gold prices reflect the supply and demand of available gold. Governmental decisions, such as the executive order issued by the President of the United States in 1933 requiring all persons in the United States to deliver gold to the Federal Reserve or the abandonment of the gold standard by the United States in 1971, have been viewed as having significant impact on the supply and demand of gold and the price of gold. Future governmental decisions may have an impact on the price of gold and may result in a significant decrease or increase in the value of the net assets and the net asset value of the Trust. Further regulations applicable to U.S. banks and non-U.S. bank entities operating in the United States with respect to their trading in physical commodities, such as precious metals, may further impact the price of gold in the United States.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBecause the Trust holds only gold, an investment in the Trust may be more volatile than an investment in a more broadly diversified portfolio.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust holds only gold. As a result, the Trust\u2019s holdings are not diversified. Accordingly, the Trust\u2019s net asset value may be more volatile than another investment vehicle with a more broadly diversified portfolio and may fluctuate substantially over short or long periods of time. Fluctuations in the price of gold are expected to have a direct impact on the value of the Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAn investment in the Trust may be deemed speculative and is not intended as a complete investment program. An investment in Shares should be considered only by persons financially able to maintain their investment and who can bear the risk of loss associated with an investment in the Trust. Investors should review closely the objective and strategy and redemption provisions of the Trust, as discussed herein, and familiarize themselves with the risks associated with an investment in the Trust.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to the Shares\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBecause the Shares are created to reflect the price of the gold held by the Trust, the market price of the Shares will be as unpredictable as the price of gold has historically been. This creates the potential for losses, regardless of whether you hold Shares for a short-, mid- or long-term period.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nShares are created to reflect, at any given time, the market price of gold owned by the Trust at that time less the Trust\u2019s expenses and liabilities. Because the value of Shares depends on the price of gold, it is subject to fluctuations similar to those affecting gold prices. The price of gold has fluctuated widely over the past several years. If gold markets continue to be characterized by the wide fluctuations that they have shown in the past several years, the price of the Shares will change widely and in an unpredictable manner. This exposes your investment in Shares to potential losses if you need to sell your Shares at a time when the price of gold is lower than it was when you made your investment in Shares. Even if you are able to hold Shares for the mid- or long-term, you may never realize a profit, because gold markets have historically experienced extended periods of flat or declining prices.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFollowing an investment in Shares, several factors may have the effect of causing a decline in the prices of gold and a corresponding decline in the price of Shares. Among them:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nlarge sales, including those by the official sector (government, central banks and related institutions), which own a significant portion of the aggregate world holdings. If one or more of these institutions decide to sell in amounts large enough to cause a decline in world gold prices, the price of the Shares will be adversely affected;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \na significant increase in gold hedging activity by gold producers. Should there be an increase in the level of hedge activity of gold producing companies, it could cause a decline in world gold prices, adversely affecting the price of the Shares;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n     9\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \na significant change in the attitude of speculators and investors towards gold. Should the speculative community take a negative view towards gold, a decline in world gold prices could occur, negatively impacting the price of the Shares;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nglobal gold supply and demand, which is influenced by such factors as gold\u2019s uses in jewelry, technology and industrial applications, purchases made by investors in the form of bars, coins and other gold products, forward selling by gold producers, purchases made by gold producers to unwind gold hedge positions, central bank purchases and sales, and production and cost levels in major gold-producing countries such as China, South Africa, the United States and Australia;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nglobal or regional political, economic or financial events and situations, especially those unexpected in nature;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \ninvestors\u2019 expectations with respect to the rate of inflation;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \ninterest rates;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \ninvestment and trading activities of hedge funds and commodity funds;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \nother economic variables such as income growth, economic output and monetary policies; and\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u25cf\n \n\n\n \ninvestor confidence.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nConversely, several factors may trigger a temporary increase in the price of gold prior to your investment in the Shares. If that is the case, you will be buying Shares at prices affected by the temporarily high prices of gold, and you may incur losses when the causes for the temporary increase disappear.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInvestors should be aware that while gold is used to preserve wealth by investors around the world, there is no assurance that gold will maintain its long\u2011term value in terms of future purchasing power. In the event the price of gold declines, the Sponsor expects the value of an investment in the Shares to decline proportionately.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFurthermore, although gold has been used as a portfolio diversifier due to its historically low-to-negative correlation with stocks and bonds, diversification does not ensure against, nor can it prevent against, risk of loss.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe amount of gold represented by each Share will decrease over the life of the Trust due to the sales of gold necessary to pay the Sponsor\n\u2019\ns fee and other Trust expenses. Without increases in the price of gold sufficient to compensate for that decrease, the price of the Shares will also decline and you will lose money on your investment in Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough the Sponsor has agreed to assume all organizational and certain ordinary administrative and marketing expenses incurred by the Trust, not all Trust expenses have been assumed by the Sponsor. For example, any taxes and other governmental charges that may be imposed on the Trust\u2019s property will not be paid by the Sponsor. As part of its agreement to assume some of the Trust\u2019s ordinary administrative expenses, the Sponsor has agreed to pay legal fees and expenses of the Trust not in excess of $100,000 per annum.\u00a0Effective January 31, 2022 the Sponsor has agreed to assume up to $500,000 per annum in legal fees and expenses. Any legal fees and expenses in excess of the amount required under the Trust Agreement will be the responsibility of the Trust.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBecause the Trust does not have any income, it needs to sell gold to cover the Sponsor\u2019s fee and expenses not assumed by the Sponsor. The Trust may also be subject to other liabilities (for example, as a result of litigation) that have also not been assumed by the Sponsor. The only source of funds to cover those liabilities will be sales of gold held by the Trust. Even if there are no expenses other than those assumed by the Sponsor, and there are no other liabilities of the Trust, the Trustee will still need to sell gold to pay the Sponsor\u2019s fee. The result of these sales is a decrease in the amount of gold represented by each Share. New deposits of gold, received in exchange for new Shares issued by the Trust, do not reverse this trend.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA decrease in the amount of gold represented by each Share results in a decrease in its price even if the price of gold has not changed. To retain the Share\u2019s original price, the price of gold has to increase. Without that increase, the lesser amount of gold represented by the Share will have a correspondingly lower price. If these increases do not occur, or are not sufficient to counter the lesser amount of gold represented by each Share, you will sustain losses on your investment in Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAn increase in the Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor, or the existence of unexpected liabilities affecting the Trust, will force the Trustee to sell larger amounts of gold, and will result in a more rapid decrease of the amount of gold represented by each Share and a corresponding decrease in its value.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust is a passive investment vehicle. The Trust is not actively managed and will be affected by a general decline in the price of gold.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trustee does not actively manage the gold held by the Trust. This means that the Trustee does not sell gold at times when its price is high, or acquire gold at low prices in the expectation of future price increases. It also means that the Trustee does not make use of any of the hedging techniques available to professional gold investors to attempt to reduce the risks of losses resulting from price decreases. Any losses sustained by the Trust will adversely affect the value of your Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n     10\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe price received upon the sale of Shares may be less than the value of the gold represented by them.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe result obtained by subtracting the Trust\u2019s expenses and liabilities on any day from the price of the gold owned by the Trust on that day is the net asset value of the Trust which, when divided by the number of Shares outstanding on that day, results in the NAV.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nShares may trade at, above or below their NAV. The NAV will fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Trust\u2019s assets. The trading prices of Shares will fluctuate in accordance with changes in their NAVs as well as market supply and demand. The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the NAV may be influenced by non-concurrent trading hours between the major gold markets and NYSE Arca. While the Shares will trade on NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. (New York time), liquidity in the market for gold will be reduced after the close of the major world gold markets, including London, Zurich and the COMEX in Chicago. As a result, during this time, trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount on Shares, may widen.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe costs inherent in buying or selling the Shares may detract significantly from investment results.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBuying or selling the Shares on an exchange involves two types of costs that apply to all securities transactions effectuated on an exchange. When buying or selling Shares through a broker or other intermediary, you will likely incur a brokerage commission or other charges imposed by that broker or intermediary. In addition, you may incur the cost of the \u201cspread,\u201d that is, the difference between what investors or market makers are willing to pay for the Shares (the \u201cbid\u201d price) and the price at which they are willing to sell the Shares (the \u201cask\u201d price). Because of the costs inherent in buying or selling the Shares, frequent trading may detract significantly from investment results and an investment in the Shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAn investment in the Shares may be adversely affected by competition from other methods of investing in gold.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust competes with other financial vehicles, including traditional debt and equity securities issued by companies in the gold industry and other securities backed by or linked to gold (including exchange-traded products), direct investments in gold and investment vehicles similar to the Trust. Market and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond the Sponsor\u2019s control, may make it more attractive to invest in other financial vehicles or to invest in gold directly, which could limit the market for the Shares and reduce the liquidity of the Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe liquidation of the Trust may occur at a time when the disposition of the Trust\n\u2019\ns gold will result in losses to investors in Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust had limited duration that was scheduled to terminate automatically on January 19, 2045. Effective January 31, 2022 the Trust is designed to have a perpetual existence\u037e however, if certain events occur, at any time, the Trustee will have to terminate the Trust.\u00a0Upon termination of the Trust, the Trustee will sell gold in the amount necessary to cover all expenses of liquidation, and to pay any outstanding liabilities of the Trust. The remaining gold will be distributed among investors surrendering Shares. Any gold remaining in the possession of the Trustee after 90 days may be sold by the Trustee and the proceeds of the sale will be held by the Trustee until claimed by any remaining holders of Shares. Sales of gold in connection with the liquidation of the Trust at a time of low prices will likely result in losses, or adversely affect your gains, on your investment in Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe liquidity of the Shares may also be affected by the withdrawal from participation of Authorized Participants.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the event that one or more Authorized Participants that have substantial interests in Shares withdraw from participation, the liquidity of the Shares will likely decrease, which could adversely affect the market price of the Shares and result in your incurring a loss on your investment in Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThere may be situations where an Authorized Participant is unable to redeem a Basket of Shares. To the extent the value of gold decreases, these delays may result in a decrease in the value of the gold the Authorized Participant will receive when the redemption occurs, as well as a reduction in liquidity for all Shareholders in the secondary market.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough Shares surrendered by Authorized Participants in Basket-size aggregations are redeemable in exchange for the underlying amount of gold, redemptions may be suspended during any period while regular trading on NYSE Arca is suspended or restricted, or in which an emergency exists that makes it reasonably impracticable to deliver, dispose of, or evaluate gold. If any of these events occurs at a time when an Authorized Participant intends to redeem Shares, and the price of gold decreases before such Authorized Participant is able again to surrender for redemption Baskets, such Authorized Participant will sustain a loss with respect to the amount that it would have been able to obtain in exchange for the gold received from the Trust upon the redemption of its Shares, had the redemption taken place when such Authorized Participant originally intended it to occur. As a consequence, Authorized Participants may reduce their trading in Shares during periods of suspension, decreasing the number of potential buyers of Shares in the secondary market and, therefore, decreasing the price a Shareholder may receive upon sale.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAuthorized Participants with large holdings may choose to terminate the Trust.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHolders of 75% of the Shares have the power to terminate the Trust. This power may be exercised by a relatively small number of holders. If it is so exercised, investors who wished to continue to invest in gold through the vehicle of the Trust will have to find another vehicle, and may not be able to find another vehicle that offers the same features as the Trust.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n     11\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe lack of an active trading market for the Shares may result in losses on your investment at the time of disposition of your Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough Shares are listed for trading on NYSE Arca, you should not assume that an active trading market for the Shares will be maintained. If you need to sell your Shares at a time when no active market for them exists, such lack of an active market will most likely adversely affect the price you receive for your Shares (assuming you are able to sell them).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf the process of creation and redemption of Baskets encounters any unanticipated difficulties, the possibility for arbitrage transactions by Authorized Participants intended to keep the price of the Shares closely linked to the price of gold may not exist and, as a result, the price of the Shares may fall or otherwise diverge from NAV.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf the processes of creation and redemption of Shares (which depend on timely transfers of gold to and by the Custodian) encounter any unanticipated difficulties, potential market participants, such as the Authorized Participants and their customers, who would otherwise be willing to purchase or redeem Baskets to take advantage of any arbitrage opportunity arising from discrepancies between the price of the Shares and the price of the underlying gold may not take the risk that, as a result of those difficulties, they may not be able to realize the profit they expect. If this is the case, the liquidity of the Shares may decline and the price of the Shares may fluctuate independently of the price of gold and may fall or otherwise diverge from NAV. Furthermore, in the event that the London market for physical gold should become relatively illiquid and thereby materially restrict opportunities for arbitraging by delivering gold in return for Baskets, the price of Shares may diverge from the value of physical gold.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs an owner of Shares, you will not have the rights normally associated with ownership of other types of shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nShares are not entitled to the same rights as shares issued by a corporation. By acquiring Shares, you are not acquiring the right to elect directors, to receive dividends, to vote on certain matters regarding the issuer of your Shares or to take other actions normally associated with the ownership of shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs an owner of Shares, you will not have the protections normally associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act, or the protections afforded by the CEA.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust is not registered as an investment company and is not required to be registered under the Investment Company Act. Consequently, the owners of Shares do not have the protections under the Investment Company Act provided to investors in registered investment companies. For example, the provisions of the Investment Company Act that limit transactions with affiliates, prohibit the suspension of redemptions (except under certain limited circumstances) or limit sales loads, among others, do not apply to the Trust.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust does not hold or trade in commodity futures contracts or any other instruments regulated by the CEA, as administered by the CFTC. Furthermore, the Trust is not a commodity pool for purposes of the CEA. Consequently, the Trustee and the Sponsor are not subject to registration as commodity pool operators with respect to the Trust. The owners of Shares do not receive the CEA disclosure document and certified annual report required to be delivered by the registered commodity pool operator with respect to a commodity pool, and the owners of Shares do not have the regulatory protections provided to investors in commodity pools operated by registered commodity pool operators.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe value of the Shares will be adversely affected if the Trust is required to indemnify the Sponsor or the Custodian as contemplated in the Trust Agreement and the Custodian Agreement.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnder the Trust Agreement, the Sponsor has a right to be indemnified from the Trust for any liability or expense it incurs without negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part. Similarly, the Custodian Agreement provides for indemnification of the Custodian by the Trust, under certain circumstances. This means that it may be necessary to sell assets of the Trust in order to cover losses or liability suffered by the Sponsor or the Custodian. Any sale of that kind would reduce the net asset value of the Trust and the value of the Shares\n.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to the Trust and Its Operations\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust is exposed to various operational risks.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust is exposed to various operational risks, including human error, information technology failures and failure to comply with formal procedures intended to mitigate these risks, and is particularly dependent on electronic means of communicating, record-keeping and otherwise conducting business. In addition, the Trust generally exculpates, and in some cases indemnifies, its service providers and agents with respect to losses arising from unforeseen circumstances and events, which may include the interruption, suspension or restriction of trading on or the closure of NYSE Arca, power or other mechanical or technological failures or interruptions, computer viruses, communications disruptions, work stoppages, natural disasters, fire, war, terrorism, riots, rebellions or other circumstances beyond the control of the Trust or its service providers and agents. Accordingly, the Trust generally bears the risk of loss with respect to these unforeseen circumstances and events to the extent relating to the Trust or the Shares, which may limit or prevent the Trust from generating returns corresponding to those of the Index or otherwise expose it to loss.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n     12\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough it is generally expected that the Trust\u2019s direct service providers and agents will have disaster recovery or similar programs or safeguards in place to mitigate the effect of such unforeseen circumstances and events, there can be no assurance that these safeguards are in place for all parties whose activities may affect the performance of the Trust, or that these safeguards, even if implemented, will be successful in preventing losses associated with such unforeseen circumstances and events. Nor can there be any assurance that the systems and applications on which the Trust relies will continue to operate as intended. In addition to potentially causing performance failures at, or direct losses to, the Trust, any such unforeseen circumstances and events or operational failures may further distract the service providers, agents or personnel on which the Trust relies, reducing their ability to conduct the activities on which the Trust is dependent. These risks cannot be fully mitigated or prevented, and further efforts or expenditures to do so may not be cost\u2011effective, whether due to reduced benefits from implementing additional or redundant safeguards or due to increases in associated maintenance requirements and other expenses that may make it more costly for the Trust to operate in more typical circumstances.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust may be negatively impacted by the effects of the spread of illnesses or other public health emergencies on the global economy and the markets and service providers relevant to the performance of the Trust.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAn outbreak of infectious respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus known as COVID-19 was first detected in China in December 2019 and has now been spread globally. This outbreak has resulted in travel restrictions, closed international borders, enhanced health screenings at ports of entry and elsewhere, disruption of and delays in healthcare service preparation and delivery, prolonged quarantines, event cancellations, supply chain disruptions, and lower consumer demand, layoffs, defaults and other significant economic impacts, as well as general concern and uncertainty. The impact of this outbreak has adversely affected the economies of many nations and the entire global economy and may impact individual issuers and capital markets in ways that cannot necessarily be foreseen. Other infectious illness outbreaks that may arise in the future could have similar impacts. Public health crises caused by the outbreak may exacerbate other pre-existing political, social and economic risks in certain countries or globally.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak will have serious negative effects on social, economic and financial systems, including significant uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets. For instance, the suspension of operations of mines, refineries and vaults that extract, produce or store gold, restrictions on travel that delay or prevent the transportation of gold, and an increase in demand for gold may disrupt supply chains for gold, which could cause secondary market spreads to widen and compromise our ability to settle transactions on time. Any inability of the Trust to issue or redeem Shares or the Custodian or any sub-custodian to receive or deliver gold as a result of the outbreak will negatively affect the Trust\u2019s operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe duration of the outbreak and its effects cannot be determined with certainty. A prolonged outbreak could result in an increase of the costs of the Trust, affect liquidity in the market for gold as well as the correlation between the price of the Shares and the net asset value of the Trust, any of which could adversely affect the value of your Shares. In addition, the outbreak could also impair the information technology and other operational systems upon which the Trust\u2019s service providers, including the Sponsor, the Trustee and the Custodian, rely, and could otherwise disrupt the ability of employees of the Trust\u2019s service providers to perform essential tasks on behalf of the Trust. Governmental and quasi-governmental authorities and regulators throughout the world have in the past responded to major economic disruptions with a variety of fiscal and monetary policy changes, including, but not limited to, direct capital infusions into companies, new monetary programs and lower interest rates. An unexpected or quick reversal of these policies, or the ineffectiveness of these policies, is likely to increase volatility in the market for gold, which could adversely affect the price of the Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFurther, the outbreak could interfere with or prevent the operation of the electronic auction hosted by IBA to determine the LBMA Gold Price, which the Trustee uses to value the gold held by the Trust and calculate the net asset value of the Trust. The outbreak could also cause the closure of futures exchanges, which could eliminate the ability of Authorized Participants to hedge purchases of Baskets, increasing trading costs of Shares and resulting in a sustained premium or discount in the Shares. Each of these outcomes would negatively impact the Trust.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust relies on the information and technology systems of the Custodian, the Trustee and, to a lesser degree, the Sponsor, which could be adversely affected by information systems interruptions, cybersecurity attacks or other disruptions which could have a material adverse effect on our record keeping and operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Custodian, the Trustee and, to a lesser degree, the Sponsor, depend upon information technology infrastructure, including network, hardware and software systems to conduct their business as it relates to the Trust. A cybersecurity incident, or a failure to protect their computer systems, networks and information against cybersecurity threats, could result in loss or unintended disclosure of information or loss or theft of the Trust assets, and could adversely impact the ability of the Trust\u2019s service providers to conduct their business, including their business on behalf of the Trust. Despite implementation of network and other cybersecurity measures, these security measures may not be adequate to protect against all cybersecurity threats.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Sponsor and its affiliates manage other accounts, funds or trusts, including those that invest in physical gold bullion or other precious metals, and conflicts of interest may occur, which may reduce the value of the net assets of the Trust, the NAV and the trading price of the Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Sponsor or its affiliates and associates currently engage in, and may in the future engage, in the promotion, management or investment management of other accounts, funds or trusts that invest primarily in physical gold bullion or other precious metals. Although officers and professional staff of the Sponsor\u2019s management intend to devote as much time to the Trust as is deemed appropriate to perform their duties, the Sponsor\u2019s management may allocate their time and services among the Trust and the other accounts, funds or trusts. The Sponsor will provide any such services to the Trust on terms not less favorable to the Trust than would be available from a non-affiliated party.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n     13\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Sponsor and the Trustee may agree to amend the Trust Agreement without the consent of the Shareholders.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Sponsor and the Trustee may agree to amend the Trust Agreement, including to increase the Sponsor\u2019s Fee, without Shareholder consent. The Sponsor shall determine the contents and manner of delivery of any notice of any Trust Agreement amendment. If an amendment imposes new fees and charges or increases existing fees or charges, including the Sponsor\u2019s Fee (except for taxes and other governmental charges, registration fees or other such expenses), or prejudices a substantial right of Shareholders, it will become effective for outstanding Shares 30 days after notice of such amendment is given to registered owners. Shareholders that are not registered owners (which most shareholders will not be) may not receive specific notice of a fee increase other than through an amendment to the prospectus. Moreover, at the time an amendment becomes effective, by continuing to hold Shares, Shareholders are deemed to agree to the amendment and to be bound by the Trust Agreement as amended without specific agreement to such increase (other than through the \u201cnegative consent\u201d procedure described above).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to the Custody of Gold\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe gold bullion custody operations of the Custodian are not subject to specific governmental regulatory supervision.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Custodian is responsible for the safekeeping of the Trust\u2019s gold bullion and also facilitates the transfer of gold bullion into and out of the Trust. Although the Custodian is a market maker, clearer and approved weigher under the rules of the LBMA (which sets out good practices for participants in the bullion market), the LBMA is not an official or governmental regulatory body. Furthermore, although the Custodian is generally regulated in the UK by the Prudential Regulatory Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority, such regulations do not directly cover the Custodian\u2019s gold bullion custody operations in the UK. Accordingly, the Trust is dependent on the Custodian to comply with the best practices of the LBMA and to implement satisfactory internal controls for its gold bullion custody operations in order to keep the Trust\u2019s gold bullion secure.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe value of the Shares will be adversely affected if gold owned by the Trust is lost or damaged in circumstances in which the Trust is not in a position to recover the corresponding loss.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Custodian is responsible to the Trust for loss or damage to the Trust\u2019s gold only under limited circumstances. The Custodian Agreement contemplates that the Custodian will be responsible to the Trust only if it acts with negligence, fraud or in willful default of its obligations under the Custodian Agreement. In addition, the Custodian has agreed to indemnify the Trust for any loss or liability directly resulting from a breach of the Custodian\u2019s representations and warranties in the Custodian Agreement, a failure of the Custodian to act in accordance with the Trustee\u2019s instructions or any physical loss, destruction or damage to the gold held for the Trust\u2019s account, except for losses due to nuclear fission or fusion, radioactivity, war, terrorist event, invasion, insurrection, civil commotion, riot, strike, act of government or public authority, act of God or a similar cause that is beyond the control of the Custodian for which the Custodian will not be responsible to the Trust. The Custodian has no obligation to replace any gold lost under circumstances for which the Custodian is liable to the Trust. The Custodian\u2019s liability to the Trust, if any, will be limited to the value of any gold lost, or the amount of any balance held on an unallocated basis, at the time of the Custodian\u2019s negligence, fraud or willful default, or at the time of the act or omission giving rise to the claim for indemnification.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, because the Custodian Agreement is governed by English law, any rights which the holders of the Shares may have against the Custodian will be different from, and may be more limited than, those that could have been available to them under the laws of a different jurisdiction. The choice of English law to govern the Custodian Agreement, however, is not expected to affect any rights that the holders of the Shares may have against the Trust or the Trustee.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAny loss of gold owned by the Trust will result in a corresponding loss in the NAV and it is reasonable to expect that such loss will also result in a decrease in the value at which the Shares are traded on NYSE Arca.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough the relationship between the Custodian and the Trustee concerning the Trust\u2019s allocated gold is expressly governed by English law, a court hearing any legal dispute concerning that arrangement may disregard that choice of law and apply U.S. law, in which case the ability of the Trust to seek legal redress against the Custodian may be limited.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe obligations of the Custodian under the Custodian\u00a0Agreement\u00a0are governed by English law. The Trust is a New York common law trust. Any U.S., New York or other court situated in the United States may have difficulty interpreting English law (which, insofar as it relates to custody arrangements, is largely derived from court rulings rather than statute), LBMA rules or the customs and practices in the London custody market. It may be difficult or impossible for the Trust to sue the Custodian in a U.S., New York or other court situated in the United States. In addition, it may be difficult, time consuming and/or expensive for the Trust to enforce in a foreign court a judgment rendered by a U.S., New York or other court situated in the United States.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nShareholders and Authorized Participants lack the right under the Custodian Agreement to assert claims directly against the Custodian, which significantly limits their options for recourse.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNeither the Shareholders nor any Authorized Participant\u00a0have a right under the Custodian Agreement to assert a claim of the Trustee against the Custodian. Claims under the Custodian Agreement may only be asserted by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n     14\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGold transferred to the Trust in connection with the creation of Baskets may not be of the quality required under the Trust Agreement. The Trust will sustain a loss if the Trustee\u00a0issues Shares in exchange for gold of inferior quality and that loss will adversely affect the value of all existing Shares.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe procedures agreed to with the Custodian contemplate that the Custodian must undertake certain tasks in connection with the inspection of gold delivered by Authorized Participants in exchange for Baskets. The Custodian\u2019s inspection includes review of the corresponding bar list to ensure that it accurately describes the weight, fineness, refiner marks and bar numbers appearing on the gold bars, but does not include any chemical or other tests designed to verify that the gold received does, in fact, meet the purity requirements referred to in the Trust Agreement. Accordingly, such inspection procedures may not prevent the deposit of gold that fails to meet these purity standards. Each Authorized Participant that deposits gold in the Trust is liable to the Trust if that gold does not meet the requirements of the Trust Agreement. The Custodian will not be responsible or liable to the Trust or to any investor in the event any gold otherwise properly inspected by it does not meet the purity requirements contained in the Trust Agreement. To the extent that Baskets are issued in exchange for gold of inferior quality and the Trust is not able to recover damages from the Authorized Participant that deposited that gold, the total value of the assets of the Trust will be adversely affected and, with it, the NAV. In these circumstances, it is reasonable to expect that the value at which the Shares trade on NYSE Arca will also be adversely affected.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust\u2019s lack of insurance protection and the Shareholders\n\u2019\n limited rights of legal recourse against the Trust, the Trustee, the Sponsor, the Custodian and any sub-custodian expose the Shareholders to the risk of loss of the Trust\u2019s gold for which no person is liable.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust does not insure its gold. The Custodian maintains insurance on such terms and conditions as it considers appropriate in connection with its custodial obligations under the Custodian Agreement and is responsible for all costs, fees and expenses arising from the insurance policy or policies. The Trust is not a beneficiary of any such insurance and does not have the ability to dictate the existence, nature or amount of coverage. Therefore, Shareholders cannot be assured that the Custodian maintains adequate insurance or any insurance with respect to the gold held by the Custodian on behalf of the Trust. In addition, the Custodian Agreement does not require any direct or indirect sub-custodians to be insured or bonded with respect to their custodial activities or in respect of the gold held by them on behalf of the Trust. Further, Shareholders\u2019 legal recourse against the Trust, the Trustee, the Sponsor, the Custodian, and any sub-custodians is limited. Consequently, a loss may be suffered with respect to the Trust\u2019s gold which is not covered by insurance and for which no person is liable in damages.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "item7": ">Item 7. Management\u2019\ns Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThis information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included with this report. The discussion and analysis that follows may contain statements that relate to future events or future performance. In some cases, such forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as \n\u201c\nmay,\n\u201d\n \n\u201c\nshould,\n\u201d\n \n\u201c\ncould,\n\u201d\n \n\u201c\nexpect,\n\u201d\n \n\u201c\nplan,\n\u201d\n \n\u201c\nanticipate,\n\u201d\n \n\u201c\nbelieve,\n\u201d\n \n\u201c\nestimate,\n\u201d\n \n\u201c\npredict,\n\u201d\n \n\u201c\npotential\n\u201d\n or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially. These statements are based upon certain assumptions and analyses made by the Sponsor on the basis of its perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances. Whether or not actual results and developments will conform to the Sponsor\n\u2019\ns expectations and predictions, however, is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the special considerations discussed below, general economic, market and business conditions, changes in laws or regulations, including those concerning taxes, made by governmental authorities or regulatory bodies, and other world economic and political developments. Although the Sponsor does not make forward-looking statements unless it believes it has a reasonable basis for doing so, the Sponsor cannot guarantee their accuracy. Except as required by applicable disclosure laws, neither the Trust nor the Sponsor is under a duty to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform such statements to actual results or to a change in the Sponsor\n\u2019\ns expectations or predictions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust is a grantor trust formed under the laws of the State of New York. The Trust does not have any officers, directors, or employees, and is administered by the Trustee acting as trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement. The Trust issues Shares representing fractional undivided beneficial interests in its net assets. The assets of the Trust consist primarily of gold bullion held by a custodian as an agent of the Trust responsible only to the Trustee.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust is a passive investment vehicle and seeks to reflect generally the performance of the price of gold. The Trust seeks to reflect such performance before payment of the Trust\u2019s expenses and liabilities. The Trust does not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from, or ameliorate losses caused by, changes in the price of gold.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust issues and redeems Shares only in exchange for gold, only in aggregations of 50,000 Shares (a \u201cBasket\u201d) or integral multiples thereof, and only in transactions with registered broker-dealers that have previously entered into an agreement with the Sponsor and the Trustee governing the terms and conditions of such issuance (such broker-dealers, the \u201cAuthorized Participants\u201d). A list of the current Authorized Participants is available from the Sponsor or the Trustee.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nShares of the Trust trade on NYSE Arca, Inc. under the ticker symbol IAU.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nValuation of Gold Bullion\n\u037e\n Computation of Net Asset Value\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn each business day, as soon as practicable after 4:00 p.m. (New York time), the Trustee evaluates the gold held by the Trust and determines the net asset value of the Trust and the NAV. The Trustee values the gold held by the Trust using the price per fine troy ounce of gold determined in an electronic auction hosted by IBA that begins at 3:00 p.m. (London time) and published shortly thereafter, on the day the valuation takes place (such price, the \u201cLBMA Gold Price PM\u201d). If there is no announced LBMA Gold Price PM on any day, the Trustee is authorized to use the most recently announced price of gold determined in an electronic auction hosted by IBA that begins at 10:30 a.m. (London time) (such price, the \u201cLBMA Gold Price AM\u201d), unless the Trustee, in consultation with the Sponsor, determines that such price is inappropriate as a basis for evaluation. The LBMA Gold Price AM and LBMA Gold Price PM are used by the Trust because they are commonly used by the U.S. gold market as indicators of the value of gold and are permitted to be used under the Trust Agreement. The use of indicators of the value of gold bullion other than the LBMA Gold Price AM and LBMA Gold Price PM could result in materially different fair value pricing of the gold held by the Trust, and as such, could result in different cost or market adjustments or in different redemption value adjustments of the outstanding redeemable capital Shares. Having valued the gold held by the Trust, the Trustee then subtracts all accrued fees, expenses and other liabilities of the Trust from the total value of the gold and other assets held by the Trust. The result is the net asset value of the Trust. The Trustee computes NAV by dividing the net asset value of the Trust by the number of Shares outstanding on the date the computation is made.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n     17\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLiquidity\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust is not aware of any trends, demands, conditions or events that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to its liquidity needs. In exchange for a fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume most of the expenses incurred by the Trust. As a result, the only ordinary expense of the Trust during the period covered by this report was the Sponsor\u2019s fee. The Trust\u2019s only source of liquidity is its sales of gold.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements relies on estimates and assumptions that impact the Trust\u2019s financial position and results of operations. These estimates and assumptions affect the Trust\u2019s application of accounting policies. A description of the valuation of gold bullion, a critical accounting policy that the Trust believes is important to understanding its results of operations and financial position, is provided in the section entitled \u201cValuation of Gold Bullion; Computation of Net Asset Value\u201d\u00a0above. In addition, please refer to Note 2 to the financial statements included in this report for further discussion of the Trust\u2019s accounting policies.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nValuation of Gold Bullion\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFair value of the gold bullion is based on the LBMA Gold Price PM. If there is no announced LBMA Gold Price PM on a business day, the Trustee is authorized to use the most recently announced LBMA Gold Price AM.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThere are other indicators of the value of gold bullion that are available that could be different than that chosen by the Trust. The LBMA Gold Price AM and LBMA Gold Price PM are used by the Trust because they are commonly used by the U.S. gold market as indicators of the value of gold, and are permitted to be used under the Trust Agreement. The use of indicators of the value of gold bullion other than the LBMA Gold Price AM and LBMA Gold Price PM could result in materially different fair value pricing of the gold held by the Trust.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n     18\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe following chart shows the daily LBMA Gold Price, as applicable, for the period from December 2016 through December 2021:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGold Prices (December 2016 - December 2021)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nResults of Operations\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Year Ended December 31, 2021\n(a)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust\u2019s net asset value decreased from $31,918,269,136 at December 31, 2020 to $28,723,023,637 at December 31, 2021, a 10.01% decrease for the year. The decrease in the Trust\u2019s net asset value resulted primarily from a decrease in the number of outstanding Shares, which fell from 885,225,000 at December 31, 2020 to 829,750,000 at December 31, 2021, a consequence of 53,075,000 Shares (1,062 Baskets) being created and 108,550,000 Shares (2,171\u00a0Baskets) being redeemed during the year. The decrease in the Trust\u2019s net asset value was also affected by a decrease in the LBMA Gold Price, which fell 3.75% from $1,891.10 at December 31, 2020 to $1,820.10 at December 31, 2021. The Board of Directors authorized a one-for-two reverse stock split for the\u00a0Trust, effective at the market open on May 24, 2021. The impact of the stock split was to raise the NAV by a factor of two and decrease the shares outstanding, resulting in no effect on the net assets of the Trust. The financial statements for the Trust have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe 3.99% decrease in the NAV from $36.06 at December 31, 2020 to $34.62 at December 31, 2021 is directly related to the 3.75% decrease in the price of gold.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe NAV decreased slightly more than the price of gold on a percentage basis due to the Sponsor\u2019s fees, which were $72,773,331 for the year, or 0.25% of the Trust\u2019s average weighted assets of $29,100,578,209 during the year. The NAV of $37.04 on January 4, 2021 was the highest during the year, compared with a low of $32.08\u00a0on March 30, 2021.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNet decrease in net assets resulting from operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1,399,133,475, resulting from an unrealized loss on investment in gold bullion of $1,904,612,983 and a net investment loss of $72,773,331, partially offset by a net realized gain of $565,428,591\u00a0on gold bullion distributed for the redemption of Shares and a net realized gain of $12,824,248 from gold bullion sold to pay expenses during the year. Other than the Sponsor\u2019s fees of $72,773,331, the Trust had no expenses during the year.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n     19\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Year Ended December 31, 2020\n(a)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust\u2019s net asset value increased from $17,628,525,082 at December 31, 2019 to $31,918,269,136 at December 31, 2020, an 81.06% increase for the year. The increase in the Trust\u2019s net asset value resulted primarily from an increase in the number of outstanding Shares, which rose from 605,575,000 at December 31, 2019 to 885,225,000 at December 31, 2020, a consequence of 359,650,000 Shares (7,193 Baskets) being created and 80,000,000 Shares (1,600 Baskets) being redeemed during the year. The increase in the Trust\u2019s net asset value also benefited from an increase in the LBMA Gold Price, which rose 24.16% from $1,523.00 at December 31, 2019 to $1,891.10 at December 31, 2020.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe 23.83% rise in the\u00a0NAV from $29.12 at December 31, 2019 to $36.06 at December 31, 2020 was directly related to the 24.16% increase in the price of gold.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe\u00a0NAV increased slightly less than the price of gold on a percentage basis due to the Sponsor\u2019s fees, which were $65,443,749 for the year, or 0.25% of the Trust\u2019s average weighted assets of $26,216,201,970 during the year. The NAV of $39.46 on August 6, 2020 was the highest during the year, compared with a low of $28.16 on March 19, 2020.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNet increase in net assets resulting from operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $4,804,011,813, resulting from an unrealized gain on investment in gold bullion of $4,373,267,647 and a net realized gain of $483,306,743\u00a0on gold bullion distributed for the redemption of Shares and a net realized gain of $12,881,172 on gold bullion sold to pay expenses during the year, partially offset by a net investment loss of $65,443,749. Other than the Sponsor\u2019s fees of $65,443,749, the Trust had no expenses during the year.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Year Ended December 31, 2019\n(a)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Trust\u2019s net asset value increased from $11,544,738,146 at December 31, 2018 to $17,628,525,082 at December 31, 2019, a 52.70% increase for the year. The increase in the Trust\u2019s net asset value resulted primarily from an increase in the number of outstanding Shares, which rose from 470,100,000 at December 31, 2018 to 605,575,000 at December 31, 2019, a consequence of 191,675,000 Shares (3,834 Baskets) being created and 56,200,000 Shares (1,124 Baskets) being redeemed during the year. The increase in the Trust\u2019s net asset value also benefited from an increase in the LBMA Gold Price, which rose 18.83% from $1,281.65 at December 31, 2018 to $1,523.00 at December 31, 2019.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe 18.57% increase in the\u00a0NAV from $24.56 at December 31, 2018 to $29.12 at December 31, 2019 is directly related to the 18.83% increase in the price of gold.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe\u00a0NAV increased slightly less than the price of gold on a percentage basis due to the Sponsor\u2019s fees, which were $35,318,380 for the year, or 0.25% of the Trust\u2019s average weighted assets of $14,144,367,726 during the year.
