{"item1": ">Item 1.\n\n\n\n\nBusiness \n\n\nThe Company, formed in November 2007 as a Virginia corporation, is a self-advised REIT that invests in income-producing real estate, primarily in the lodging sector, in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d). The Company has elected to be treated as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. As of December\u00a031, 2021, the Company owned 219 hotels with an aggregate of 28,747 rooms located in urban, high-end suburban and developing markets throughout 36 states. As of December\u00a031, 2021, substantially all of the Company\u2019s hotels operate under Marriott or Hilton brands. The hotels are operated and managed under separate management agreements with 16 hotel management companies, none of which are affiliated with the Company. The Company\u2019s common shares are listed on the \nNew York Stock Exchange\n (\u201cNYSE\u201d) under the ticker symbol \u201cAPLE.\u201d The Company has no foreign operations or assets and its operating structure includes only one reportable segment. Refer to Part II, Item 8, for the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n\n\nBusiness Objectives\n\n\nThe Company is one of the largest hospitality REITs in the U.S., in both the number of hotels and guest rooms, with significant geographic and brand diversity. The Company\u2019s primary business objective is to maximize shareholder value by achieving long-term growth in cash available for distributions to its shareholders. The Company has pursued and will continue to pursue this objective through the following investment strategies:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\npursuing thoughtful capital allocation with selective acquisitions and dispositions of primarily rooms-focused hotels in the upscale sector of the lodging industry;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nemploying broad geographic diversification of its investments;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nfranchising and collaborating with leading brands in the sector;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nutilizing strong experienced operators for its hotels and enhancing their performance with proactive asset management;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nreinvesting in the Company\u2019s hotels to maintain their competitive advantage; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nmaintaining low leverage providing the Company with financial flexibility.\n\n\nThe Company has generally acquired fee simple ownership of its properties, with a focus on hotels that have or have the potential to have diverse demand generators, strong brand recognition, high levels of customer satisfaction and strong operating margins. Due to their efficient operating model and strong consumer preference, the Company concentrates on the acquisition of rooms-focused hotels. The Company\u2019s acquisitions have been in broadly diversified markets across the U.S. to limit dependence on any one geographic area or demand generator. With an emphasis on upscale rooms-focused hotels, the Company utilizes its asset management experience and expertise to improve the quality and performance of its hotels by working with its property managers to aggressively manage revenue and expenses by benchmarking with internal and external data, using the Company\u2019s scale to help negotiate favorable vendor contracts, engaging industry leaders in hotel management, and franchising the hotels with leading brands and actively participating with the franchisors to strengthen the brands. To maintain its competitive advantage in each market, the Company continually reinvests in its hotels. With its depth of ownership in many upscale and upper midscale rooms-focused brands and extensive experience with the Hilton and Marriott rooms-focused brands, the Company has been able to enhance its reinvestment approach. By maintaining a flexible balance sheet, with a total debt to total capitalization (total debt outstanding plus equity market capitalization based on the Company\u2019s December\u00a031, 2021 closing share price) ratio at December\u00a031, 2021 of 28.1%, the Company is not only positioned to opportunistically consider investments that further improve shareholder value, but management believes it is equipped to address developments caused by adverse economic environments such as the current conditions brought on by COVID-19.\n\n\nThe Impact of COVID-19 on the Company and the Hospitality Industry\n\n\nSince first being reported in December 2019, COVID-19 has spread globally, including to every state in the U.S. On March\u00a011, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and on March\u00a013, 2020, the U.S. declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19.\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has not only specifically reduced travel, but also has had a detrimental impact on regional and global economies and financial markets. The global, national and local impact of the pandemic has continued to evolve and many countries, including the U.S., as well as state and local governments, have reacted and continue to react with a \n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\nwide variety of measures intended to control its spread, including states of emergency, mandatory quarantines, implementation of \u201cstay at home\u201d orders, business closures, border closings, and restrictions on travel and large gatherings, which\u00a0has\u00a0resulted in, and may continue to result in,\u00a0cancellation of events, including sporting events, conferences and meetings. \nWhile the Company\u2019s operating results and the overall economy in the U.S. continue to show signs of recovery, the\n Company cannot presently determine the extent or duration of the overall operational and financial effects that COVID-19 will have on the Company, its business, the hospitality industry and the economy\n, or whether the recovery will continue\n.\n See \u201c\nThe Impact of COVID-19 on the Company and the Hospitality Industry\n\u201d in Part II, Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of \nO\nperations, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for more information about the Company\u2019s response to the effects of COVID-19.\n\n\nHotel Operating Performance \n\n\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, the Company owned 219 hotels with a total of 28,747 rooms as compared to 234 hotels with a total of 29,937 rooms as of December\u00a031, 2020 and 233 hotels with a total of 29,870 rooms as of December\u00a031, 2019. Operating performance is included only for the period of ownership for hotels acquired or disposed of during 2021, 2020 and 2019. During 2021, the Company acquired eight hotels and sold 23 hotels. During 2020, the Company acquired four hotels and sold three hotels. During 2019, the Company acquired three hotels and sold 11 hotels. The following table reflects certain operating statistics for the Company\u2019s hotels for their respective periods of ownership by the Company. Average Daily Rate (\u201cADR\u201d) is calculated as room revenue divided by the number of rooms sold, and revenue per available room (\u201cRevPAR\u201d) is calculated as occupancy multiplied by ADR.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2019\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADR\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n123.78\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n111.49\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n137.30\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOccupancy\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n66.3\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n46.1\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n77.0\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevPAR\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n82.03\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n51.34\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n105.72\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nComparable Hotels Operating Performance\n\n\nThe following table reflects certain operating statistics for the Company\u2019s 219 hotels owned as of December\u00a031, 2021 (\u201cComparable Hotels\u201d).

The Company\u2019s revenue and operating results improved during 2021 as compared to 2020, which is consistent with the overall lodging industry. However, as a result of COVID-19, the Company\u2019s revenue and operating results declined as compared to 2019 and the Company expects\u00a0future revenues could be negatively impacted if, for example, COVID-19 cases begin to increase again, new vaccine-resistant variants emerge, state and local governments tighten or implement new mitigation restrictions or consumer sentiment deteriorates. The Company can give no assurances as to the amount or period of decline that may result from uncertainty regarding the duration and long-term impact of, as well as governmental and consumer response to, COVID-19. \nSee Part II, Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the Company\u2019s results of operations. \n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\nRecent \nInvesting Activities\n\n\nAcquisitions and Contracts for Potential Acquisitions \n\n\nThe Company continually monitors market conditions and attempts to maximize shareholder value by investing in properties that it believes provide superior value over the long term.\u00a0\nConsistent with this strategy and the Company\u2019s focus on investing in rooms-focused hotels, \nin 2019 the Company entered into a contract to purchase a 176-room Hilton Garden Inn to be constructed in Madison, Wisconsin. Construction of the hotel was completed in February 2021 and the Company acquired the hotel on February 18, 2021 for a gross purchase price of $49.6 million, utilizing borrowings under the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility. In 2021, the Company also acquired seven existing hotels for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $311.9 million: a 178-room AC Hotel in Portland, Maine; a 130-room Hyatt Place in Greenville, South Carolina; a 157-room Aloft in Portland, Maine; a 150-room Hilton Garden Inn in Memphis, Tennessee; a 157-room Hilton Garden Inn in Fort Worth, Texas; a 112-room Homewood Suites in Fort Worth, Texas; and a 243-room Hampton Inn & Suites in Portland, Oregon. The Company utilized available cash (including a portion of the proceeds from the sale of 20 hotels in July 2021) and borrowings under its revolving credit facility to fund the acquisitions and plans to utilize its credit facilities available at closing for any additional acquisitions. In addition, on August 16, 2021, the Company purchased the fee interest in the land at its Seattle, Washington Residence Inn that was previously under a ground lease for a purchase price of $80.0 million, consisting of a $24.0 million cash payment utilizing a portion of the proceeds from the sale of 20 hotels in July 2021 and a one-year note payable to the seller for $56.0 million.\n\n\n As of December 31, 2021 the Company had an outstanding contract for the potential purchase of a hotel under development in Madison, Wisconsin for a purchase price of $78.6 million, which is expected to be completed as a 260-room Embassy Suites and opened for business in early 2024, at which time the Company expects to complete the purchase of this hotel. Although the Company is working towards acquiring this hotel, there are a number of conditions to closing that have not yet been satisfied and there can be no assurance that closing on this hotel will occur under the outstanding purchase contract. \n\n\nDispositions and Contracts for Potential Dispositions \n\n\nFor its existing portfolio, the Company monitors each property\u2019s profitability, market conditions and capital requirements and attempts to maximize shareholder value by disposing of properties when it believes that superior value can be provided from the sale of the property.\u00a0As a result, \ni\nn 2021, the Company sold a total of 23 hotels \nfor a total combined gross sales price of approximately $234.6 million.\n The net proceeds from the sales were used to pay down borrowings under the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility, for acquisitions of hotel properties in the second half of 2021 and for general corporate purposes.\n\n\nSee Note 2 titled \u201cInvestment in Real Estate\u201d and Note 3 titled \u201cDispositions\u201d in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information concerning these transactions.\n\n\nShare Repurchases \n\n\nIn addition to continually considering opportunities to invest in rooms-focused hotels, the Company also monitors the trading price of its common shares and repurchases its common shares when it believes there is an opportunity to increase shareholder value. \nIn May 2021, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors approved an extension of its existing share repurchase program, authorizing share repurchases up to an aggregate of $345\u00a0million (the \u201cShare Repurchase Program\u201d). No common shares were repurchased in 2021. Past r\nepurchases under the share repurchase program have been funded, and the Company intends to fund future repurchases, with cash on hand or availability under its unsecured credit facilities, subject to applicable restrictions under the Company\u2019s unsecured credit facilities (if any).\n \nThe timing of share repurchases and the number of common shares to be repurchased under the Share Repurchase Program will also depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory requirements and other factors. \n\n\nSee Note 7 titled \u201cShareholders\u2019 Equity\u201d in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information concerning the share repurchase program.\n\n\nHotel Industry and Competition \n\n\nThe hotel industry is highly competitive. Each of the Company\u2019s hotels competes for guests primarily with other hotels in its immediate vicinity and secondarily with other hotels or lodging facilities in its geographic market. An increase in the \n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\nnumber of competitive hotels\n or other lodging facilities\n in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on the occupancy, ADR and RevPAR of the Company\u2019s hotels in that area. The Company believes that brand recognition, location, price and quality (of both the hotel and the services provided) are the principal competitive factors affecting the Company\u2019s hotels. Additionally, general economic conditions\n, both\n in a particular market and nationally\n,\n impact the performance of the hotel industry.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nManagement and Franchise Agreements \n\n\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s hotels operate under Marriott or Hilton brands, and as of December\u00a031, 2021, consisted of the following:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Hotels and Guest Rooms by Brand\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nNumber of\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nNumber of\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nHotels\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nRooms\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHilton Garden Inn\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n5,592\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHampton\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n37\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n4,953\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourtyard\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n33\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n4,653\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHomewood Suites\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3,417\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidence Inn\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3,548\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFairfield\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n1,213\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome2 Suites\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n1,146\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpringHill Suites\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n1,245\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTownePlace Suites\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n931\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHyatt Place\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n411\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarriott\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n619\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmbassy Suites\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n316\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndependent\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n263\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAC\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n178\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAloft\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n157\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHyatt House\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n105\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n219\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n28,747\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEach of the Company\u2019s 219 hotels owned as of December\u00a031, 2021 is operated and managed under separate management agreements with 16 hotel management companies, none of which are affiliated with the Company. The management agreements generally provide for initial terms of one to 30 years and are terminable by the Company for either failure to achieve performance thresholds, sale of the property, or without cause. As of December\u00a031, 2021, over 80% of the Company\u2019s hotels operate under a variable management fee agreement, with an average initial term of approximately one to two years, which the Company believes better aligns incentives for each hotel manager to maximize each property\u2019s performance than a base-plus-incentive management fee structure, as described below, which is more common throughout the industry. Under the variable fee structure, the management fee earned for each hotel is generally within a range of 2.5% to 3.5% of gross revenues. The performance measures are based on various financial and quality performance metrics. The Company\u2019s remaining hotels operate under a management fee structure which generally includes the payment of base management fees and an opportunity for incentive management fees. Under this structure, base management fees are calculated as a percentage of gross revenues and the incentive management fees are calculated as a percentage of operating profit in excess of a priority return to the Company, as defined in the management agreements. In addition to the above, management fees for all of the Company\u2019s hotels generally include accounting fees and other fees for centralized services, which are allocated among all of the hotels that receive the benefit of such services. During 2020 and 2021, in response to COVID-19 and its impact on hotel performance, the management fee under all variable management fee agreements was set to 3% of gross revenues.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThirteen of the Company\u2019s hotels are managed by affiliates of Marriott. The remainder of the Company\u2019s hotels are managed by companies that are not affiliated with either Marriott, Hilton or Hyatt, and, as a result, the branded hotels they manage were required to obtain separate franchise agreements with each respective franchisor. The franchise agreements generally provide for initial terms of approximately 10 to 30 years and generally provide for renewals subject to franchise requirements at the time of renewal. The Company pays various fees under these agreements, including the payment of royalty fees, marketing fees, reservation fees, a communications support fee, brand loyalty program fees and other similar fees based on room revenues.\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\nThe franchise and/or management agreements provide a variety of benefits for the Company, which include national advertising, publicity, and other marketing programs designed to increase brand awareness, training of personnel, continuous\n \nreview of quality standards, centralized reservation systems and best practices within the industry.\n\n\nHotel Maintenance and Renovation \n\n\nManagement routinely monitors the condition and operations of its hotels and plans renovations and other improvements as it deems prudent. The Company\u2019s hotels have an ongoing need for renovation and refurbishment. To maintain and enhance each property\u2019s competitive position in its market, the Company has invested in and plans to continue to reinvest in its hotels. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company\u2019s capital improvements for its hotels were approximately $25.8 million, $37.6 million and $78.7 million, respectively. Expenditures for 2021 and 2020 were lower than previous years due to the reduction of non-essential capital improvement projects as a result of COVID-19. During 2022, the Company anticipates investing approximately $55 to $65 million in capital improvements, which includes renovation projects for approximately 20 to 25 properties. \n\n\nFinancing\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s principal daily sources of liquidity are the operating cash flow generated from the Company\u2019s properties and availability under its revolving credit facility. Depending on market conditions, the Company also may enter into additional secured and unsecured debt financing or issue common shares through equity offerings, such as the Company\u2019s at-the-market offering program described below.\u00a0The Company anticipates that funds from these sources will be adequate to meet its anticipated liquidity requirements, including debt service, hotel acquisitions, hotel renovations, share repurchases, and required distributions to shareholders.\n\n\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, the Company had approximately $1.4 billion of total outstanding debt with a combined weighted-average interest rate, including the effect of interest rate swaps, of approximately 3.38%, consisting of approximately $498.0 million in outstanding mortgage debt secured by 28 properties, with maturity dates ranging from August 2022 to May 2038 and stated interest rates ranging from 3.40% to 5.00%, and approximately $946.0 million in outstanding debt under its unsecured credit facilities with maturity dates ranging from July 2022 to March 2030 and effective interest rates, including the effect of interest rate swaps, ranging from 1.58% to 4.64%.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s unused borrowing capacity under its $425 million revolving credit facility as of December\u00a031, 2021 was $349.0 million, which is available for acquisitions, hotel renovations, share repurchases, working capital and other general corporate funding purposes, including the payment of distributions to shareholders. \nAs discussed above, the Company has historically maintained and plans in the future to maintain relatively low leverage as compared to the real estate industry as a whole and the lodging sector in particular. The Company\u2019s ratio of total debt to total capitalization as of December\u00a031, 2021 was 28.1%. The Company intends to maintain staggered maturities of its debt, utilize unsecured debt when available and fix the rate on a portion of its debt. All of these strategies reduce shareholder risk related to the Company\u2019s financing structure. \n\n\nAs a result of COVID-19 and the associated disruption to the Company\u2019s operating results, the Company entered into amendments in June 2020 that suspended the testing of the Company\u2019s existing financial maintenance covenants under the unsecured credit facilities. These amendments imposed certain restrictions \nregarding its investing and financing activities that were applicable during a specified waiver period, including, but not limited to, limitations on the acquisition of property, payment of distributions to shareholders, capital expenditures and use of proceeds from the sale of property or common shares of the Company. On March 1, 2021, as a result of the continued disruption from COVID-19 and the related uncertainty with respect to the Company\u2019s future operating results, the Company entered into further amendments to each of the unsecured credit facilities to extend the covenant waiver period for all but two of the Company\u2019s existing financial maintenance covenants until the date that the compliance certificate was required to be delivered for the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2022 (unless the Company elected an earlier date) (the \u201cExtended Covenant Waiver Period\u201d).\n The testing for the other two covenants, the Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and the Minimum Unsecured Interest Coverage Ratio, was suspended until the compliance certificate was required to be delivered for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2022 (unless the Company elected an earlier date). \nIn July 2021, the Company notified its lenders under its unsecured credit facilities that it had elected to exit the Extended Covenant Waiver Period effective on July 29, 2021. Upon exiting the Extended Covenant Waiver Period, the Company is no longer subject to certain restrictions regarding its investing and financing activities that were applicable during the Extended Covenant Waiver Period, including, but not limited to, limitations on the acquisition of property, payment of distributions to shareholders, capital expenditures and use of proceeds from the sale of property or common shares of the Company. Those restrictions, including the restriction on payment of distributions to shareholders, were still in place throughout the second quarter of 2021. \nSee Note 4 titled \u201cDebt\u201d in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated \n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\nFinancial Statements and Notes thereto\n, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K\n for additional information regarding the \nCompany\u2019s debt\n, including the amendments\n \nto each of the unsecured credit facilities \nand \nthe exit \nfrom\n \nthe Extended Covenant Waiver Period\n mentioned above\n.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company has a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-231021) that was automatically effective upon filing on April 25, 2019.\u00a0The Company may offer an indeterminate number or amount, as the case may be, of (1) common shares, no par value per share; (2) preferred shares, no par value per share; (3) depository shares representing the Company\u2019s preferred shares; (4) warrants exercisable for the Company\u2019s common shares, preferred shares or depository shares representing preferred shares; (5) rights to purchase common shares; and (6) unsecured senior or subordinate debt securities, all of which may be issued from time to time on a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. \nOn August 12, 2020, the Company entered into an equity distribution agreement pursuant to which the Company may sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $300\u00a0million of its common shares under an at-the-market offering program (the \u201cATM Program\u201d). As of December\u00a031, 2021, the Company had sold approximately \n4.7 million common shares under its ATM Program at a weighted-average market sales price of approximately $16.26 per common share and received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $76.0 million and proceeds net of offering costs, which included $0.9 million of commissions, of approximately $75.1 million. The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of these shares primarily to pay down borrowings under its revolving credit facility and used the corresponding increased availability under the revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions of hotel properties. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $224.0 million remained available for issuance under the ATM Program. The Company plans to use future net proceeds from the sale of these shares to continue \nto pay down borrowings under its revolving credit facility\n (if any).\n The Company plans to use the corresponding increased availability under the revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes which may include, among other things, acquisitions of additional properties, the repayment of other outstanding indebtedness, capital expenditures, improvement of properties in its portfolio and working capital. \nThe Company may also use the net proceeds to acquire another REIT or other company that invests in income producing properties.\n Future offerings will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company, including market conditions, the trading price of the Company\u2019s common shares and opportunities for uses of any proceeds.\n\n\nDistribution Policy\n \n\n\nThe Company has historically paid distributions on a monthly basis, with distributions based on anticipated cash generated from operations. The Company attempts to set a rate that can be consistent over a period of time as it forecasts its cash available from operations. As a result of COVID-19 and the impact on its business, the Company suspended its monthly distributions in March 2020. As discussed in Note 4 titled \u201cDebt\u201d in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, d\nuring the Extended Covenant Waiver Period,\u00a0\nas a\n\u00a0requirement under the amendments to its unsecured credit facilities, the Company was restricted in its ability to make distributions except for the payment of cash distributions of $0.01 per common share per quarter or to the extent required to maintain REIT status. Beginning in March 2021, the Board of Directors declared distributions of $0.01 per common share in the last month of each quarter and the distributions were paid out each following month. \nAs discussed above, in July 2021, the Company notified its lenders under its unsecured credit facilities that it had elected to exit the Extended Covenant Waiver Period effective on July 29, 2021. As a result, upon exiting the Extended Covenant Waiver Period, the Company is no longer subject to the restrictions on distributions that were applicable during the Extended Covenant Waiver Period. \n\n\nOn February 22, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors has reinstated its policy of distributions on a monthly basis and declared a monthly cash distribution of $0.05 per common share payable on March 15, 2022. While management expects monthly cash distributions to continue, \neach distribution is subject to approval by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors and there can be no assurance of the classification, timing or duration of distributions at the current distribution rate. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors, in consultation with management, will continue to monitor hotel operations and the timing and level of distributions in relation to the Company\u2019s other cash requirements or in order to maintain its REIT status for federal income tax purposes. \nIf cash flow from operations and the revolving credit facility are not adequate to meet liquidity requirements, the Company may utilize additional financing sources to make distributions. \nAs it has done historically, due to seasonality, the Company may use its revolving credit facility to maintain consistency of the distribution rate, taking into consideration any acquisitions, dispositions, capital improvements and economic cycles. \nAlthough the Company has relatively low levels of debt, there can be no assurance it will be successful with this strategy and may need to reduce its distributions to required levels to maintain its REIT status. If the Company were unable to extend its maturing debt in future periods or if it were to default on its debt, it may be unable to make distributions.\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\nInsurance\n\n\nThe Company maintains insurance coverage for general liability, property, business interruption, cyber threats and other risks with respect to all of its hotels. These policies offer coverage features and insured limits that the Company believes are customary for similar types of properties in similar locations. However, various types of catastrophic losses, like earthquakes, hurricanes, or certain types of terrorism, may not be insurable or may not be economically insurable.\n\n\nEnvironmental Matters \n\n\nThe Company\u2019s hotels are subject to various U.S. federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that address a wide variety of issues, including, but not limited to, storage tanks, air emissions from emergency generators, storm water and waste water discharges, lead-based paint, mold and mildew and waste management, and impose liability for contamination. In connection with each of the Company\u2019s hotel acquisitions, the Company reviewed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment and additional environmental reports and surveys, as were necessitated by the preliminary report. Based on the reports, the Company is not aware of any environmental situations requiring remediation at the Company\u2019s properties, which have not been, or are not currently being remediated as necessary. No material remediation costs have occurred or are expected to occur. Under various laws, owners as well as tenants and operators of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up or remove hazardous substances present at or migrating from properties they own, lease or operate and may be held liable for property damage or personal injuries that result from hazardous substances. These laws also expose the Company to the possibility that it may become liable to reimburse governments for damages and costs they incur in connection with hazardous substances. \n\n\nSustainability\n\n\nThe Company established a formal energy management program in 2018 and adopted a formal Environmental Policy in 2020 to ensure that energy, water and waste management are a priority not only within the Company, but also with the Company\u2019s management companies. In addition to being more operationally efficient, rooms-focused hotels are more environmentally efficient than full-service hotels and resorts. With less open or unused space and less equipment needed for operating than full-service hotels, rooms-focused hotels use less electricity, water and natural gas on a per-square-foot basis than full-service or resort hotels. In addition to its overall strategy of investing in rooms-focused hotels, the Company is committed to identifying and incorporating sustainability opportunities into its investment and asset management strategies, with a focus on minimizing its environmental impact through reductions in energy and water consumption and improvements in waste management. The Company seeks to invest in proven sustainability practices when renovating its hotels and in portfolio-wide capital projects that can enhance asset value while also improving environmental performance. For example, the Company has realized cost savings and reductions in its carbon footprint through the installation of LED lighting, energy management systems, smart irrigation systems and the use of energy and water conservation guidelines at the property level with 98% of the Company\u2019s portfolio as of December 31, 2020 enrolled in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Energy Star program. Additionally, as part of the Company\u2019s acquisition due diligence, the Company performs sustainability assessments to identify areas of opportunity that will improve the property\u2019s environmental performance, and when working with developers to construct new hotels, strives to implement environmentally efficient construction and building functionality.\n\n\nHuman Capital\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company believes that each of its 63 team members (as of December\u00a031, 2021) plays a vital role in the success of the organization. Management aims to provide an inspiring, inclusive work environment where employees feel valued, empowered and encouraged to make positive differences within the Company and throughout their communities, with a belief that the most successful management provides clear leadership while empowering the team to make timely and responsible decisions and to take actions necessary to achieve exceptional operating results. The Company is committed to diversity, equity and inclusion and does not tolerate discrimination or harassment in the workplace.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company offers competitive compensation and benefits, a flexible leave policy, fully paid parental leave, an education reimbursement program, and a culture that encourages balance of work and personal life. The Company provides its employees with two days paid leave each year for volunteer work and donation matching to support non-profit organizations. The Company emphasizes an open-door policy for communication and conducts regular employee satisfaction surveys, which provide the opportunity for continuous improvement.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company is committed to working safely and maintaining a safe workplace in compliance with cleanliness guidelines set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and in compliance with applicable Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) standards.\n\n\nThe Company has implemented various initiatives to ensure the Company remains inclusive, equitable and supportive for all, including a formal online training program that all employees of the Company are required to complete annually for the prevention of discrimination and harassment in the workplace, including unconscious bias.\n\n\nDuring 2021, all employees involved in the day-to-day operation of the Company\u2019s hotels were employed by one of 16 third-party management companies engaged pursuant to the hotel management agreements. \n\n\nSocial Engagement\n\n\nThe Company is committed to strengthening its communities through charitable giving, encouraging employees to volunteer their time and talents, and participation in the many philanthropic programs important to its employees and leaders within its industry, including its brands, the American Hotel & Lodging Association and its hotel management companies. \nIn 2017, the Company formed Apple Gives, an employee-led charitable organization, to expand its impact and further advance the achievement of the Company\u2019s corporate philanthropic goals. Apple Gives organizes company-wide community events with charitable organizations, deploys aid to markets and associates affected by natural disasters, and allocates funds and other resources to a variety of causes. Apple Gives strives to select organizations that are important to the Company\u2019s employees, the Company\u2019s third-party management companies, its hotels and numerous industry organizations. Since Apple Gives was formed, the Company has contributed to more than 100 non-profit organizations, including through company-matched donations, and employees have devoted more than 550 hours volunteering and fundraising for a variety of charitable organizations. The Company\u2019s hotels and third-party management companies are engaged in targeted charitable programs that provide support to their respective communities, and hotel associates are encouraged to serve in ways that improve their localities. The Company\u2019s third-party management companies donate to food drives, participate in charity walks and bike rides, assemble care packages, donate school supplies, provide disaster relief, and pursue numerous other altruistic initiatives.\n \n\n\nSeasonality \n\n\nThe hotel industry has been historically seasonal in nature. Seasonal variations in occupancy at the Company\u2019s hotels may cause quarterly fluctuations in its revenues. Generally, occupancy rates and hotel revenues for the Company\u2019s hotels are greater in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters. However, due to the effects of COVID-19, these typical seasonal patterns were disrupted in 2020 and 2021, although the Company experienced some seasonal decrease in demand in the first and fourth quarter of each year. To the extent that cash flow from operations is insufficient during any quarter, due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenue, the Company expects to utilize cash on hand or available financing sources to meet cash requirements. \n\n\nRelated Parties\n\n\nThe Company has, and is expected to continue to engage in, transactions with related parties. These transactions cannot be construed to be at arm\u2019s length and the results of the Company\u2019s operations may be different if these transactions were conducted with non-related parties. Certain employees of the Company also provide support services to Apple Realty Group, Inc. (\u201cARG\u201d), which is wholly owned by Glade M. Knight, Executive Chairman of the Company. ARG reimburses the Company for the support services that it receives.\n\n\n See Note 6 titled \u201cRelated Parties\u201d in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information concerning the Company\u2019s related party transactions.\n\n\nWebsite Access \n\n\nThe address of the Company\u2019s Internet website is www.applehospitalityreit.com. The Company makes available free of charge through its Internet website its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form\u00a08-K, proxy statements, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the SEC. Information contained on the Company\u2019s website is not incorporated by reference into this report. \n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "item1a": ">Item 1A.\n\n\n\n\nRisk Factors \n\n\nThe Company has identified the following significant risk factors which may affect, among other things, the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, operating cash flow, market value, and ability to service its debt obligations and make distributions to its shareholders. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the risks disclosed by the Company in other filings with the SEC, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business and Operations\n\n\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic has significantly adversely impacted and disrupted, and is expected to continue to significantly adversely impact and disrupt, the Company\u2019s business, financial performance and condition, operating results and cash flows, as could any future outbreak of another highly infectious or contagious disease.\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, including resurgences and new variants, has had and continues to have a detrimental impact on, and another pandemic in the future could similarly impact, regional and global economies and financial markets. The global, national and local impact of the pandemic has continued to evolve and many countries, including the U.S., and state and local governments, have reacted and continue to react with a wide variety of measures intended to control its spread, including states of emergency, mandatory quarantines, implementation of stay-at-home orders, business closures, border closings, and restrictions on travel and large gatherings, which has resulted in cancellation of events, including sporting events, conferences and meetings. \n\n\nThe effects of the pandemic on the hotel industry are unprecedented. COVID-19 has disrupted the industry and has dramatically reduced business and impacted leisure travel, which has had a significant adverse impact, and management expects COVID-19, including new variants, will continue to significantly adversely impact and disrupt the Company\u2019s business, financial performance and condition, operating results and cash flows. Beginning in March 2020, the Company experienced a significant decline in revenue throughout its portfolio and the Company expects the impact of this decline to continue for an extended period of time. More than half of the Company\u2019s properties continue to operate at reduced levels as compared to 2019 and the Company has reduced certain services and amenities. Although currently all of the Company\u2019s hotels are open, the Company may need or elect to temporarily suspend operations at\u00a0properties in the future depending on the length and severity of COVID-19 and related effects, including any increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. If operations at the Company\u2019s hotel properties are suspended, the Company cannot give any assurance as to when they will resume operations at a full or reduced level.\n\n\nAdditional factors that would negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to successfully operate during or following COVID-19 or another pandemic, or that could otherwise significantly adversely impact and disrupt its business, financial performance and condition, operating results and cash flows, include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nsustained negative consumer or business sentiment or continued corporate travel policy restrictions, including beyond the end of COVID-19, which could further adversely impact demand for lodging;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ncontinued postponement and cancellation of events, including sporting events, conferences and meetings;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nhotel closures and the Company\u2019s ability to reopen hotels that are temporarily closed in a timely manner, and its ability to attract customers to its hotels when they are able to reopen;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\na severe disruption or instability in the global financial markets or deterioration in credit and financing conditions;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ncontinued increased costs and potential difficulty accessing supplies related to personal protective equipment, increased sanitation, social distancing and other mitigation measures at hotels;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ncontinued increased labor costs to attract employees due to government-issued vaccination requirements or prohibitions, perceived risk of exposure to COVID-19, as well as potential for increased workers\u2019 compensation claims if hotel employees are exposed to COVID-19 through the workplace; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nincreased susceptibility to litigation related to, among other things, the financial impacts of COVID-19 on the Company\u2019s business or litigation related to individuals contracting COVID-19 as a result of alleged exposures on the Company\u2019s premises.\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe results of these factors could include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ncontinued decreased demand resulting in hotel properties not generating revenue sufficient to meet operating expenses, which may adversely affect the value of the Company\u2019s hotel properties, potentially requiring the Company to recognize significant non-cash impairment charges or other significant unanticipated cash or non-cash costs;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe further scaling back and delay of a significant amount of the Company\u2019s planned capital expenditures, including planned renovation projects, which could adversely affect the value of the Company\u2019s properties;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\na material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to consummate acquisitions and dispositions of hotel properties;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nchanges in the amount or frequency of the Company\u2019s distributions;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nincreased indebtedness and sustained or further decreases in operating results, which could increase the Company\u2019s risk of default under its loan agreements or other long-term contracts;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ninability of the Company to maintain compliance with certain covenants in its unsecured credit facilities and the need to seek amendments to such facilities in the future, which could result in concessions from the Company, such as increased interest rates;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nincreased volatility of the Company\u2019s stock price;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ndisruptions in the Company\u2019s supply chains, which may increase operating costs and costs for essential capital improvements or may impact hotels that are under development and that the Company expects to acquire following completion;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ndeclines in regional and local economies, reducing travel to and from the localities;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nincreased risk that the Company could be required to close on the purchase under its existing contracts for newly developed hotels, where the hotel is not legally allowed to open due to temporary regulations resulting from COVID-19 mitigation;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nincreased risk in the Company\u2019s and its management companies\u2019 ability to retain, and the continued service and availability of, personnel, including the Company\u2019s senior leadership team and key field personnel, including general managers, and the Company\u2019s ability to recruit, attract and retain skilled personnel to the extent its management or personnel are impacted by the outbreak of pandemic or epidemic disease and are not available or allowed to conduct work;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ndisruptions as a result of corporate employees working remotely, including risk of cybersecurity incidents and disruptions to internal control procedures; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ndifficulty accessing debt and equity capital on attractive terms, or at all, under the Company\u2019s secured and unsecured indebtedness, or capital necessary to fund business operations or address maturing liabilities.\n\n\nMoreover, many risk factors set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be interpreted as heightened risks as a result of the ongoing and numerous adverse impacts of COVID-19.\n\n\nThe extent and duration of the impacts caused by COVID-19 on the Company\u2019s business, including financial condition, operating results and cash flows, remains largely uncertain and dependent on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the continued severity, duration, transmission rate and geographic spread of COVID-19 in the U.S.; the effectiveness, acceptance and availability of vaccines; the duration of associated immunity and efficacy of the vaccines against variants of COVID-19; the extent and effectiveness of actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact; the timing of and manner in which containment efforts are reduced or lifted; and the response of the overall economy, the financial markets and the population, particularly in areas in which the Company operates, as containment measures are reduced or lifted.\u00a0As a result, the Company cannot provide an estimate of the overall impact of COVID-19 on its business or when, or if, the Company will be able to resume pre-COVID-19 levels of operations. COVID-19 presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to the Company\u2019s business, financial performance and condition, operating results and cash flows.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company is subject to various risks which are common to the hotel industry on a national, regional and local market basis that are beyond its control and could adversely affect its business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe success of the Company\u2019s hotels depends largely on the hotel operators\u2019 ability to adapt to dominant trends and risks in the hotel industry, both nationally and in individual local markets. These risks could adversely affect hotel occupancy and the rates that can be charged for hotel rooms as well as hotel operating expenses. The following is a summary of risks that may affect the hotel industry in general and as a result may affect the Company: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nover-building of hotels in the markets in which the Company operates, resulting in an increase in supply of hotel rooms that exceeds increases in demand;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ncompetition from other hotels and lodging alternatives in the markets in which the Company operates;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\na downturn in the hospitality industry;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ndependence on business and leisure travel;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nincreases in energy costs and other travel expenses, which may affect travel patterns and reduce business and leisure travel;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nreduced business and leisure travel due to geo-political uncertainty, including terrorism, travel-related health concerns, including COVID-19 or other widespread outbreaks of infectious or contagious diseases in the U.S., inclement weather conditions, including natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and wildfires, and government shutdowns, airline strikes or other disruptions; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nreduced travel due to adverse national, regional or local economic and market conditions;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nseasonality of the hotel industry may cause quarterly fluctuations in operating results;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nchanges in marketing and distribution for the hospitality industry including the cost and the ability of third-party internet and other travel intermediaries to attract and retain customers;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nchanges in hotel room demand generators in a local market;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nability of a hotel franchise to fulfill its obligations to franchisees;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nbrand expansion; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe performance of third-party managers of the Company\u2019s hotels;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nincreases in operating costs, including ground lease payments, property and casualty insurance, utilities and real estate and personal property taxes, due to inflation, climate change and other factors that may not be offset by increased room rates; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nlabor shortages and other increases in the cost of labor due to low unemployment rates or to government regulations surrounding work rules, government-issued vaccination requirements or prohibitions, wage rates, health care coverage and other benefits;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nchanges in governmental laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance with applicable laws and regulations; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nbusiness interruptions due to cyber-attacks and other technological events;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nrequirements for periodic capital reinvestment to repair and upgrade hotels;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nlimited alternative uses for hotel buildings; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ncondemnation or uninsured losses.\n\n\nAny of these factors, among others, may reduce the Company\u2019s operating results, the value of the properties that the Company owns, and the availability of capital to the Company. \n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\nE\nconomic conditions in the \nU.S. \nand individual markets may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business operations and financial performance.\n\n\nThe performance of the lodging industry has historically been highly cyclical and closely linked to the performance of the general economy both nationally and within local markets in the U.S. The lodging industry is also sensitive to government, business and personal discretionary spending levels. Declines in government and corporate budgets and consumer demand due to adverse general economic conditions, risks affecting or reducing travel patterns, lower consumer confidence or adverse political conditions have lowered and may continue to lower the revenue and profitability of the Company\u2019s hotels and therefore the net operating profits of its investments. \nAn economic downturn or prolonged economic recession, including lower GDP growth, corporate earnings, consumer confidence, employment rates, income levels and personal wealth, has led and may continue to lead to a significant decline in demand for products and services provided by the lodging industry, lower occupancy levels and significantly reduced room rates. The Company cannot predict the pace or duration of an economic recession or cycle or the cycles of the lodging industry. In the event conditions in the industry deteriorate or do not continue to see sustained improvement, or there is an extended period of economic weakness, \nthe Company\u2019s revenue and profitability could be adversely affected. Furthermore, even if the economy in the U.S. improves, the Company cannot provide any assurances that demand for hotels will increase from current levels, nationally or more specifically, where the Company\u2019s properties are located. \n\n\nIn addition, many of the expenses associated with the Company\u2019s business, including certain personnel costs, interest expense, ground leases, property taxes, insurance and utilities, are relatively fixed. During a period of overall economic weakness, if the Company is unable to meaningfully decrease these costs as demand for its hotels decreases, the Company\u2019s business operations and financial performance may be adversely affected. \n\n\nThe Company is affected by restrictions in, and compliance with, its franchise and license agreements. \n\n\nThe Company\u2019s wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiaries (\u201cTRSs\u201d) (or subsidiaries thereof) operate substantially all of its hotels pursuant to franchise or license agreements with nationally recognized hotel brands. These franchise and license agreements contain specific standards for, and restrictions and limitations on, the operation and maintenance of the Company\u2019s hotels in order to maintain uniformity within the franchisor system. The Company may be required to incur costs to comply with these standards and these standards could potentially conflict with the Company\u2019s ability to create specific business plans tailored to each property and to each market. Failure to comply with these brand standards may result in termination of the applicable franchise or license agreement. \nIn addition, as the Company\u2019s franchise and license agreements expire, the Company may not be able to renew them on favorable terms, or at all.\n If the Company were to lose or was unable to renew a franchise or license agreement, the Company would be required to re-brand the hotel, which could result in a decline in the value of the hotel, the loss of marketing support and participation in guest loyalty programs, and harm to the Company\u2019s relationship with the franchisor, impeding the Company\u2019s ability to operate other hotels under the same brand. Additionally, the franchise and license agreements have provisions that could limit the Company\u2019s ability to sell or finance a hotel which could further affect the Company.\n \n\n\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s hotels operate under Marriott or Hilton brands; therefore, the Company is subject to risks associated with concentrating its portfolio in these brand families. \n\n\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s hotels operate under brands owned by Marriott or Hilton. As a result, the Company\u2019s success is dependent in part on the continued success of Marriott and Hilton and their respective brands. The Company believes that building brand value is critical to increase demand and strengthen customer loyalty. Consequently, if market recognition or the positive perception of any of these brands is reduced or compromised, the goodwill associated with the Marriott or Hilton branded hotels in the Company\u2019s portfolio may be adversely affected. Also, if Marriott or Hilton alter certain policies, including their respective guest loyalty programs, this could reduce the Company\u2019s future revenues. Furthermore, if the Company\u2019s relationship with Marriott or Hilton were to deteriorate or terminate as a result of disputes regarding the Company\u2019s hotels or for other reasons, the franchisors could, under certain circumstances, terminate the Company\u2019s current franchise licenses with them or decline to provide franchise licenses for hotels that the Company may acquire in the future. If any of the foregoing were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\n\n\nAlthough substantially all of the Company\u2019s hotels operate under the brands noted above, the Company owns and may from time to time acquire independent hotels or hotels affiliated with other brands, and/or may choose to operate hotels independently of a brand if the Company believes that these properties will operate most effectively as independent hotels. However, without the support and recognition of a large established brand, the capability of these independent or less recognized branded hotels to market the hotel, maintain guest loyalty, attract new guests, and operate in a cost-effective manner may be difficult, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s overall operating results.\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\nCompetition in the markets where the \nCompany\n owns hotels may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\n\n\nThe hotel industry is highly competitive. Each of the Company\u2019s hotels competes for guests primarily with other hotels in its immediate vicinity and secondarily with other hotels in its geographic market. The Company also competes with numerous owners and operators of vacation ownership resorts, as well as alternative lodging companies, including third-party providers of short-term rental properties and serviced apartments that can be rented on a nightly, weekly or monthly basis. An increase in the number of competitive hotels, vacation ownership resorts and alternative lodging arrangements in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on the occupancy, ADR and RevPAR of the Company\u2019s hotels in that area and lower the Company\u2019s revenue and profitability. \n\n\nThe Company is dependent on third-party hotel managers to operate its hotels and could be adversely affected if such management companies do not manage the hotels successfully.\n\n\nTo maintain its status as a REIT, the Company is not permitted to operate any of its hotels. As a result, the Company has entered into management agreements with third-party managers to operate its hotels. For this reason, the Company\u2019s ability to direct and control how its hotels are operated is less than if the Company were able to manage its hotels directly. Under the terms of the hotel management agreements, the Company\u2019s ability to participate in operating decisions regarding its hotels is limited to certain matters, and it does not have the authority to require any hotel to be operated in a particular manner (for instance, setting room rates). The Company does not supervise any of the hotel managers or their respective personnel on a day-to-day basis. The Company cannot be assured that the hotel managers will manage its hotels in a manner that is consistent with their respective obligations under the applicable management agreement or the Company\u2019s obligations under its hotel franchise agreements. The Company could be materially and adversely affected if any of its third-party managers fail to effectively manage revenues and expenses, provide quality services and amenities, or otherwise fail to manage its hotels in its best interest, and may be financially responsible for the actions and inactions of the managers. In certain situations, based on the terms of the applicable management agreement, the Company or manager may terminate the agreement. In the event that any of the Company\u2019s management agreements are terminated, the Company can provide no assurance that it could identify a replacement manager, that the franchisor will consent to the replacement manager in a timely manner, or at all, or that the replacement manager will manage the hotel successfully. A failure by the Company\u2019s hotel managers to successfully manage its hotels could lead to an increase in its operating expenses, a decrease in its revenues, or both. Furthermore, if one of the Company\u2019s third-party managers is financially unable or unwilling to perform its obligations pursuant to its management agreements with the Company, the Company\u2019s ability to find a replacement manager or managers for those properties could be costly and time-consuming for the Company and disrupt hotel operations which could materially and adversely affect the Company. \n\n\nThe growing use of non-franchisor lodging distribution channels could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and profitability.\n\n\nAlthough a majority of rooms sold are sold through the hotel franchisors\u2019 distribution channels, a growing number of the Company\u2019s hotel rooms are sold through other channels or intermediaries. Rooms sold through non-franchisors\u2019 channels are generally less profitable (after associated fees) than rooms sold through franchisors\u2019 channels. Although the Company\u2019s franchisors may have established agreements with many of these alternative channels or intermediaries that limit transaction fees for hotels, there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s franchisors will be able to renegotiate such agreements upon their expiration with terms as favorable as the provisions that exist today. Moreover, alternative channels or intermediaries may employ aggressive marketing strategies, including expending significant resources for online and television advertising campaigns to drive consumers to their websites. As a result, consumers may develop brand loyalties to the intermediaries\u2019 offered brands, websites and reservations systems rather than to those of the Company\u2019s franchisors. If this happens, the Company\u2019s business and profitability may be materially and adversely affected.\n\n\nRenovations and capital improvements at the Company\u2019s existing hotels or new hotel developments may reduce the Company\u2019s profitability.\n\n\nThe Company has ongoing needs for hotel renovations and capital improvements, including maintenance requirements and updates to brand standards under all of its hotel franchise and management agreements and certain loan agreements. In addition, from time to time the Company will need to make renovations and capital improvements to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to remain competitive with other hotels and to maintain the economic value of its hotels. As properties increase in age, the frequency and cost of renovations needed to maintain appealing facilities for hotel guests may increase. The Company may also need to make significant capital improvements to hotels that it acquires, or may be involved in the development of new hotels. Construction delays and cost overruns, including increases in the costs of labor, goods and materials and delays and cost increases caused by supply chain disruptions, have increased and may continue to increase \n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\nrenovation\n or development\n costs for the Company\n and \nhave delayed and may in the future delay\n the acquisition or opening of hotels or the length of time that rooms are out of service\n.\n \nOccupancy and ADR are often affected \nduring periods of renovations\n and capital improvements at a hotel, especially \nif the Company encounters delays\n, or if the improvements \nrequire\n significant disruption at the hotel.\n \nThe costs of \nrenovations and \ncapital improvements the Company needs or chooses to make \nat the Company\u2019s existing hotels\n,\n or the costs related to the development of new hotels\n,\n \ncould reduce the funds available for\n other purposes and may reduce the Company\u2019s profitability\n. \n\n\nCertain hotels are subject to ground leases that may affect the Company\u2019s ability to use the hotel or restrict its ability to sell the hotel.\n\n\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, 14 of the Company\u2019s hotels were subject to ground leases. Accordingly, the Company effectively only owns a long-term leasehold interest in these hotels. If the Company is found to be in breach of a ground lease, it could lose the right to use the hotel. In addition, unless the Company can purchase a fee interest in the underlying land or renew the terms of these leases before their expiration, as to which no assurance can be given, the Company will lose its right to operate these properties and its interest in the property, including any investment that it made in the property. The Company\u2019s ability to exercise any extension options relating to its ground leases is subject to the condition that the Company is not in default under the terms of the ground lease at the time that it exercises such options, and the Company can provide no assurances that it will be able to exercise any available options at such time. If the Company were to lose the right to use a hotel due to a breach or non-renewal of a ground lease, it would be unable to derive income from such hotel. Finally, the Company may not be permitted to sell or finance a hotel subject to a ground lease without the consent of the lessor. \n\n\nThe Company may not be able to complete hotel dispositions when and as anticipated.\n\n\nThe Company continually monitors the profitability of its hotels, market conditions, and capital requirements and attempts to maximize shareholder value by timely disposal of its hotels. Real estate investments are, in general, relatively difficult to sell due to, among other factors, the size of the required investment and the volatility in availability of adequate financing for a potential buyer. This illiquidity will tend to limit the Company\u2019s ability to promptly vary its portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions. Additionally, factors specific to an individual property, such as its specific market and operating performance, restrictions in franchise and management agreements, debt secured by the property, a ground lease, or capital expenditure needs may further increase the difficulty in selling a property. Therefore, the Company cannot predict whether it will be able to sell any hotels on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, provisions of the Code relating to REITs have certain limits on the Company\u2019s ability to sell hotels.\n\n\nReal estate impairment losses may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\nAs a result of changes in an individual hotel\u2019s operating results or to the Company\u2019s planned hold period for a hotel, the Company may be required to record an impairment loss for a property. The Company analyzes its hotel properties individually for indicators of impairment throughout the year. The Company records an impairment loss on a hotel property if indicators of impairment are present, and the sum of the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the respective property over its estimated remaining useful life, based on historical and industry data, is less than the property\u2019s carrying amount. Indicators of impairment include, but are not limited to, a property with current or potential losses from operations, when it becomes more likely than not that a property will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when events, trends, contingencies or changes in circumstances indicate that a triggering event has occurred and an asset\u2019s carrying value may not be recoverable. \n\n\nThe Company\u2019s failure to identify and complete accretive acquisitions may adversely affect the profitability of the Company. \n\n\nThe Company\u2019s business strategy includes identifying and completing accretive hotel acquisitions. The Company competes with other investors who are engaged in the acquisition of hotels, and these competitors may affect the supply and demand dynamics and, accordingly, increase the price the Company must pay for hotels it seeks to acquire, or these competitors may succeed in acquiring those hotels. Any delay or failure on the Company\u2019s part to identify, negotiate, finance on favorable terms, consummate and integrate such acquisitions could materially impede the Company\u2019s growth. The Company may also incur costs that it cannot recover if it abandons a potential acquisition. Also, if the Company does not reinvest proceeds received from hotel dispositions into new properties in a timely manner, the Company\u2019s profitability could be negatively impacted. The Company\u2019s profitability may also suffer because future acquisitions of hotels may not yield the returns the Company expects and the integration of such acquisitions may disrupt the Company\u2019s business or may take longer than projected.\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s inability to obtain financing on \nfavorable\n terms or pay amounts due on its financing may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\n\n\nAlthough the Company anticipates maintaining relatively low levels of debt, it may periodically use financing to acquire properties, perform renovations to its properties, or make shareholder distributions or share repurchases in periods of fluctuating income from its properties. The credit markets have historically been volatile and subject to increased regulation, and as a result, the Company may not be able to obtain debt financing to meet its cash requirements, including refinancing any scheduled debt maturities, which may adversely affect its ability to execute its business strategy. If the Company refinances debt, such refinancing may not be in the same amount or on terms as favorable as the terms of the existing debt being refinanced. If the Company is unable to refinance its debt, it may be forced to dispose of hotels or issue equity at inopportune times or on disadvantageous terms, which could result in higher costs of capital. \n\n\nThe Company is also subject to risks associated with increases in interest rates with respect to the Company\u2019s variable-rate debt which could reduce cash from operations. In addition, the Company has used interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risks on a portion of its variable-rate debt, and in the future, it may use hedging arrangements, such as interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate volatility. The Company\u2019s actual hedging decisions are determined in light of the facts and circumstances existing at the time of the hedge. There is no assurance that the Company\u2019s hedging strategy will achieve its objectives, and the Company may be subject to costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs, if it terminates these hedging arrangements.\n\n\nThe phase-out, replacement, or unavailability of LIBOR as the reference interest rate under the Company\u2019s variable-rate debt and hedging arrangements could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company, and the replacement rate may differ from LIBOR and between the loan and hedge markets.\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s variable-rate debt and hedging arrangements use the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as the reference rate. On March 5, 2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) announced staggered dates by which LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative. In connection with the cessation of LIBOR, the Company expects a transition from LIBOR to another reference rate by June 30, 2023. \n\n\nThe Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), which is published by the New York Federal Reserve, has been proposed as the preferred alternative to LIBOR as a reference rate. In October 2020, after a number of industry consultations, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association published a LIBOR transition protocol, to which the Company has adhered. The discontinuation of LIBOR, and the transition to SOFR or another alternative reference rate may be disruptive to financial markets. When LIBOR is discontinued, the interest rate for the Company\u2019s variable-rate debt will be based on an alternative reference rate as specified in the applicable documentation governing such debt, and the reference rate for its interest rate swaps will be SOFR unless otherwise agreed. Such an event would not affect the Company\u2019s ability to borrow or maintain already outstanding borrowings or outstanding swaps, but SOFR or another replacement reference rate could perform differently than LIBOR prior to its discontinuance. While market participants have proposed certain methods to interpolate and transition between LIBOR and SOFR, there can be no assurance that SOFR (including a term SOFR or compounded SOFR) will perform in the same way as LIBOR would have at any time, including, without limitation, as a result of changes in interest and yield rates in the market, market volatility, or global or regional economic, financial, political, regulatory, judicial or other events. \n\n\nFurthermore, differences between LIBOR replacement methodology in loan and hedging markets could result in differences in conversion between the Company\u2019s variable-rate debt arrangements and corresponding hedges. While the loan market may eventually generally adopt the same replacement for LIBOR as the hedging market, there can be no assurance as to the timing of such adoption and any differences in the timing of adoption of LIBOR replacements between the loan and hedge market as well as differences in methodology and valuation can lead to mismatches in hedging, which could result in changes to the Company\u2019s risk exposure, adverse tax or accounting effects, and increased compliance, legal and operational costs. The transition from LIBOR, or any changes or reforms to the determination of LIBOR, could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s interest rates on its current or future indebtedness, as well as its variable-rate hedging arrangements, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\n\n\nCompliance with financial and other covenants in the Company\u2019s existing or future debt agreements may reduce operational flexibility and create default risk. \n\n\nThe Company\u2019s existing indebtedness, whether secured by mortgages on certain properties or unsecured, contains, and indebtedness that the Company may enter into in the future likely will contain, customary covenants that may restrict the Company\u2019s operations and limit its ability to enter into future indebtedness. In addition, the Company\u2019s ability to borrow under its unsecured credit facilities is subject to compliance with its financial and other covenants, including, among others, a \n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\nminimum tangible net worth, maximum debt limits, minimum interest and fixed charge coverage ratios\n,\n and restrictions on certain investments.\n \nThe Company\u2019s failure to comply with the covenants in its existing or future indebtedness, or its inability to make required principal and interest payments, could cause a default under the applicable debt agreement, which could result in the acceleration of the debt, requiring the Company to repay such debt with capital obtained from other sources, which may not be available to the Company or may only be available on unfavorable terms.\n \n\n\nIf the Company defaults on its secured debt, lenders may take possession of the property or properties securing such debt. \nAs a general policy, the Company seeks to obtain mortgages securing indebtedness which encumber only the particular property to which the indebtedness relates, but recourse on these loans may include all of its assets. If recourse on any loan incurred by the Company to acquire or refinance any particular property includes all of its assets, the equity in other properties could be reduced or eliminated through foreclosure on that loan. If a loan is secured by a mortgage on a single property, the Company could lose that property through foreclosure if it defaults on that loan. If the Company defaults under a loan, it is possible that it could become involved in litigation related to matters concerning the loan, and such litigation could result in significant costs for the Company. Additionally, defaulting under a loan may damage the Company\u2019s reputation as a borrower and may limit its ability to secure financing in the future.\n\n\nTechnology is used in operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology from cyber-attacks or other events could harm the Company\u2019s business.\n\n\nThe Company, and its hotel managers and franchisors rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records, personally identifiable information, reservations, billing and operating data. The Company and its hotel managers and franchisors rely on commercially available and internally developed systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential operator and customer information, such as personally identifiable information, including information relating to financial accounts. A number of hotels, hotel management companies, and brands have been subject to successful cyber-attacks, including those seeking guest credit card information. Moreover, the risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, nation-state affiliated actors and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. It is possible that the safety and security measures taken by the Company and its hotel managers and franchisors will not be able to prevent damage to the systems, the systems\u2019 improper functioning, or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information.\n\n\nSecurity breaches, whether through physical or electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions over the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to emails, social engineering or phishing schemes, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of information systems could interrupt operations, damage the reputations of the Company, the Company\u2019s hotel managers or franchisors, and subject the Company to liability claims or regulatory penalties that may not be fully covered by insurance, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company. \n\n\nPotential losses not covered by insurance may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition.\n\n\nThe Company maintains comprehensive insurance coverage for general liability, property, business interruption and other risks with respect to all of its hotels. These policies offer coverage features and insured limits that the Company believes are customary for similar types of properties. There are no assurances that coverage will be available or at reasonable rates in the future. \nAlso, \nvarious types of catastrophic losses, like earthquakes, hurricanes and other storms, wildfires, or certain types of terrorism, may not be insurable or may not be economically insurable for all or certain locations. Even when insurable, these policies may have high deductibles and/or high premiums. Additionally, although the Company may be insured for a particular loss, the Company is not insured against the impact a catastrophic event may have on the hospitality industry as a whole. There also can be risks such as certain environmental hazards that may be deemed to fall outside of the coverage. In the event of a substantial loss, the Company\u2019s insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover the full current market value or replacement cost of its lost investment. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, the Company could lose all or a portion of the capital it has invested in a hotel, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the hotel. In that event, the Company might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the hotel. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors might also prevent the Company from using insurance proceeds to replace or renovate a hotel after it has been damaged or destroyed. The Company also may encounter challenges with an insurance provider regarding whether it will pay a particular claim that the Company believes to be covered under the relevant policy. Under those circumstances, the \n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\ninsurance proceeds the Company receives might be inadequate to restore its economic position in the damaged or destroyed hotel\n.\n \nAdditionally, as a result of substantial claims, insurance carriers may reduce insured limits and/or increase premiums, if insurance coverage is provided at all, in the future.\n \nAny of these or similar events\n could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operation\ns\n. \n\n\nThe Company faces possible risks associated with the physical effects of, and laws and regulations related to, climate change. \n\n\nThe Company is subject to the risks associated with the physical effects of climate change, which could include more frequent or severe storms, droughts, wildfires, hurricanes and flooding, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s properties, operations and business. \nTo the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns, the markets in which the Company operates could experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea levels causing damage to the Company\u2019s properties. Over time, these conditions could result in declining hotel demand or the Company\u2019s inability to operate the affected hotels at all. Climate change also may have indirect effects on the Company\u2019s business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms the Company finds acceptable, as well as increasing the cost of renovations, energy and water at its properties. The federal government and some of the states and localities in which the Company operates have enacted certain climate change laws and regulations and/or have begun regulating carbon footprints and greenhouse gas emissions and may enact new laws in the future. Although these laws and regulations have not had any known material adverse effect on the Company to date, they could impact companies with which the Company does business or result in substantial costs to the Company, including compliance costs, construction costs, monitoring and reporting costs and capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and other new equipment. Climate change, and any future laws and regulations, or future interpretations of current laws and regulations, could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\n\n\nThe Company could incur significant, material costs related to government regulation and litigation with respect to environmental matters, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. \n\n\nThe Company\u2019s hotels are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws that impose liability for contamination. Under these laws, governmental entities have the authority to require the Company, as the current owner of a hotel, to perform or pay for the clean-up of contamination (including hazardous substances, asbestos and asbestos-containing materials, waste, petroleum products or mold) at, on, under or emanating from the hotel and to pay for natural resource damages arising from such contamination. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator or other responsible party knew of, or caused such contamination, and the liability may be joint and several. Because these laws also impose liability on persons who owned or operated a property at the time it became contaminated, it is possible the Company could incur cleanup costs or other environmental liabilities even after it sells or no longer operates hotels. Contamination at, on, under or emanating from the Company\u2019s hotels also may expose it to liability to private parties for the costs of remediation, personal injury and/or property damage. In addition, environmental laws may create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs required to address such contamination. If contamination is discovered on the Company\u2019s properties, environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which the properties may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures. Moreover, environmental contamination can affect the value of a property and, therefore, an owner's ability to borrow funds using the property as collateral or to sell the property on favorable terms, or at all. Furthermore, if, as part of the remediation of a contaminated property, the Company were to dispose of certain waste products at a waste disposal facility, such as a landfill or an incinerator, the Company may be liable for costs associated with the cleanup of that facility. \n\n\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s hotels are subject to various U.S. federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that address a wide variety of issues, including, but not limited to, storage tanks, air emissions from emergency generators, storm water and wastewater discharges, lead-based paint, mold and mildew, and waste management. Some of the Company\u2019s hotels routinely handle and use hazardous or regulated substances and wastes as part of their operations, which are subject to regulation (e.g., swimming pool chemicals and cleaning supplies). The Company\u2019s hotels incur costs to comply with these environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and could be subject to fines and penalties for non-compliance with applicable requirements. \n\n\nLiabilities and costs associated with environmental contamination at or emanating from the Company\u2019s hotel properties, defending against claims related to alleged or actual environmental issues, or complying with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could be material and could materially and adversely affect the Company. The Company can make no assurances that changes in current laws or regulations or future laws or regulations will not impose additional or new material environmental liabilities or that the current environmental condition of its hotels will not be affected by its operations, the condition of the properties in the vicinity of its hotels, or by third parties unrelated to the \n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\nCompany\n.\n \nThe discovery of material \nenvironmental liabilities at \nits\n properties could subject \nthe Company\n to unanticipated significant costs, which could signi\nficantly \nreduce or eliminate\n its\n profitability.\n\n\nThe Company may incur significant costs complying with various regulatory requirements, which could materially and adversely affect the Company. \n\n\nThe Company and its hotels are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local regulatory requirements. These requirements are wide-ranging and include among others, state and local fire and life safety requirements, federal laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Accessibility Guidelines promulgated thereunder and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Liabilities and costs associated with complying with these requirements are and could be material. If the Company fails to comply with these various requirements, it could incur governmental fines or private damage awards. In addition, existing requirements could change, and future requirements might require the Company to make significant unanticipated expenditures, which could have material and adverse effects on the Company.\n\n\nIn addition, as a result of these significant regulations, the Company could become subject to regulatory investigations and lawsuits. Regulatory investigations and lawsuits could result in significant costs to respond and costs of fines or settlements, or changes in the Company\u2019s business practices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources, and cash flows of the Company. The ability of the Company to access capital markets, including commercial debt markets, could also be negatively impacted by unfavorable, or the possibility of unfavorable, outcomes from adverse regulatory actions or lawsuits.\n\n\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Organization and Structure \n\n\nThe Company\u2019s ownership limitations may restrict or prevent certain acquisitions and transfers of its shares.\n\n\nIn order for the Company to maintain its qualification as a REIT under the Code, not more than 50% in value of its outstanding shares may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain entities) at any time during the last half of each taxable year following the Company\u2019s first year (the \u201c5/50 Test\u201d). \nAdditionally, at least 100 persons must beneficially own the Company\u2019s shares during at least 335 days of each taxable year (the \u201c100 Shareholder Test\u201d).\u00a0\nThe Company\u2019s amended and restated articles of incorporation (the \u201cCharter\u201d), with certain exceptions, authorizes the Company\u2019s Board of Directors to take the actions that are necessary and desirable to preserve its qualification as a REIT. In addition to the 5/50 Test and the 100 Shareholder Test, the Company\u2019s Charter provides that no person or entity may directly or indirectly, beneficially or constructively, own more than 9.8% of the aggregate of its outstanding common shares or 9.8% of the aggregate of the outstanding preferred shares of any class or series (\u201cshare ownership limits\u201d). The Company\u2019s Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, grant an exemption to the share ownership limits, subject to certain conditions and the receipt by the Board of Directors of certain representations and undertakings. In addition, the Board of Directors may change the share ownership limits. The share ownership limits contained in the Charter key off the ownership at any time by any \u201cperson,\u201d which term includes entities, and take into account direct and indirect ownership as determined under various ownership attribution rules in the Code. The share ownership limits might delay or prevent a transaction or a change in the Company\u2019s control that might involve a premium price for the Company\u2019s common shares or otherwise be in the best interests of its shareholders.\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s future issuances of preferred shares or debt securities may adversely affect the voting power or ownership interest of the holders of common shares or may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of the Company. \n\n\nThe Company\u2019s Charter allows the Board of Directors to issue up to 30 million \u201cblank check\u201d preferred shares, without action by shareholders. Preferred shares may be issued on terms determined by the Board of Directors, and may have rights, privileges and preferences superior to those of common shares. Without limiting the foregoing, (i) such preferred shares could have liquidation rights that are senior to the liquidation preference applicable to common shares, (ii) such preferred shares could have voting or conversion rights, which could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of common shares, and (iii) the ownership interest of holders of common shares will be diluted following the issuance of any such preferred shares. In addition, the issuance of blank check preferred shares could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of the Company. Additionally, the Company may issue debt securities which would have distribution rights that are senior to common shares and liquidation rights that are senior to the liquidation preference applicable to common shares. Common shareholders bear the risk that the Company\u2019s future issuances of preferred shares or debt securities will negatively affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common shares.\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\nProvisions of the Company\u2019s \nthird \namended\n and \nrestated\n bylaws could inhibit changes in control.\n \n\n\nProvisions in the Company\u2019s third amended and restated bylaws may make it difficult for another company to acquire it and for shareholders to receive any related takeover premium for its common shares. Pursuant to the Company\u2019s third amended and restated bylaws, directors are elected by the plurality of votes cast and entitled to vote in the election of directors. However, the Company\u2019s corporate governance guidelines require that if an incumbent director fails to receive at least a majority of the votes cast, such director will tender his or her resignation from the Board of Directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors will consider, and determine whether to accept, such resignation. Additionally, the third amended and restated bylaws of the Company have various advance notice provisions that require shareholders to meet certain requirements and deadlines for proposals at an annual meeting of shareholders. These provisions may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of the Company that might involve a premium to the price of the Company\u2019s common shares or otherwise be in the shareholders\u2019 best interests.\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s Executive Chairman has interests that may conflict with the interests of the Company and that may detract from the time devoted to the Company.\n \n\n\nGlade M. Knight, the Company\u2019s Executive Chairman, is and will be a principal in other real estate investment transactions or programs that may compete with the Company, and he is and may be a principal in other business ventures. Mr. Knight\u2019s management and economic interests in these other transactions or programs may conflict with the interests of the Company. Mr. Knight is not required to devote a fixed amount of time and attention to the Company\u2019s business affairs as opposed to the other companies, which could detract from time devoted to the Company. \n\n\nTax-Related Risks and Risks Related to the Company\u2019s Status as a REIT \n\n\nQualifying as a REIT involves highly technical\n \nand complex provisions of the Code and failure of the Company to qualify as a REIT would have adverse consequences to the Company and its shareholders.\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist. Even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize the Company\u2019s REIT qualification. Moreover, new legislation, court decisions or administrative guidance, in each case possibly with retroactive effect, may make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to qualify as a REIT. Maintaining the Company\u2019s qualification as a REIT depends on the Company\u2019s satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. The Company\u2019s ability to satisfy the REIT income and asset tests depends upon the Company\u2019s analysis of the characterization and fair market values of the Company\u2019s assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which the Company will not obtain independent appraisals, and upon the Company\u2019s ability to successfully manage the composition of its income and assets on an ongoing basis. In addition, the Company\u2019s ability to satisfy the requirements to maintain its qualification as a REIT depends in part on the actions of third parties over which the Company has no control or only limited influence.\n\n\nIf the Company does not qualify as a REIT or if the Company fails to remain qualified as a REIT, the Company will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax and potentially state and local taxes, which would reduce the Company\u2019s earnings and the amount of cash available for distribution to its shareholders.\n\n\nIf the Company failed to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year and any available relief provisions did not apply, the Company would be subject to U.S. federal and state corporate income tax on its taxable income at the regular corporate rate, and dividends paid to its shareholders would not be deductible by the Company in computing its taxable income. Unless the Company was entitled to statutory relief under certain Code provisions, the Company also would be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which it failed to qualify as a REIT.\n\n\nAny determination that the Company does not qualify as a REIT would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and could materially reduce the market price of its common shares. The Company\u2019s additional tax liability could be substantial and would reduce its net earnings available for investment, debt service or distributions to shareholders. Furthermore, the Company would no longer be required to make any distributions to shareholders as a condition to REIT qualification and all of its distributions to shareholders would be taxable as ordinary C corporation dividends to the extent of its current and accumulated earnings and profits. The Company\u2019s failure to qualify as a REIT also could cause an event of default under loan documents governing its debt.\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\nEven if t\nhe Company \nqualifies as a REIT, it \nmay \nface\n \nother \ntax liabilities that reduce its cash flow.\n\n\nEven if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local taxes, including payroll taxes, taxes on any undistributed income, taxes on income from some activities conducted as a result of a foreclosure, a 100% excise tax on any transactions with a TRS that are not conducted on an arm\u2019s-length basis, and state or local income, franchise, property and transfer taxes. Moreover, if the Company has net income from the sale of properties that are \u201cdealer\u201d properties (a \u201cprohibited transaction\u201d under the Code), that income will be subject to a 100% tax. The Company could, in certain circumstances, be required to pay an excise or penalty tax (which could be significant in amount) in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the Code to maintain its qualification as a REIT. In addition, the Company\u2019s TRSs will be subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income taxes on their net taxable income, if any. Any of these taxes would decrease cash available for other uses, such as the payment of the Company\u2019s debt obligations and distributions to shareholders.\n\n\nREIT distribution requirements could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to execute its business plan or cause it to increase debt levels or issue additional equity during unfavorable market conditions.\n\n\nThe Company generally must distribute annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gain, in order for U.S. federal corporate income tax not to apply to earnings that it distributes. To the extent that the Company satisfies this distribution requirement but distributes less than 100% of its taxable income, the Company will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on its undistributed taxable income. In addition, the Company will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that the Company pays out to its shareholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal tax laws. If there is an adjustment to any of the Company\u2019s taxable income or dividends-paid deductions, the Company could elect to use the deficiency dividend procedure in order to maintain the Company\u2019s REIT status. That deficiency dividend procedure could require the Company to make significant distributions to its shareholders and to pay significant interest to the IRS.\n\n\nFrom time to time, the Company may generate taxable income greater than its income for financial reporting purposes prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\u201cGAAP\u201d). In addition, differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash may occur. As a result, the Company may find it difficult or impossible to meet distribution requirements in certain circumstances. In particular, where the Company experiences differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash, the requirement to distribute a substantial portion of its taxable income could cause it to: (1) sell assets in unfavorable market conditions; (2) incur debt or issue additional equity on disadvantageous terms; (3) distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions or capital expenditures or used for the repayment of debt; or (4) make a taxable distribution of its common shares as part of a distribution in which shareholders may elect to receive the Company\u2019s common shares or (subject to a limit measured as a percentage of the total distribution) cash, in order to comply with REIT requirements. These alternatives could increase the Company\u2019s costs or dilute its equity. In addition, because the REIT distribution requirement prevents the Company from retaining earnings, the Company generally will be required to refinance debt at its maturity with additional debt or equity. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder the Company\u2019s ability to grow, which could adversely affect the market price of its common shares.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe Company may in the future choose to pay dividends in the form of common shares, in which case shareholders may be required to pay income taxes in excess of the cash dividends they receive.\n\n\nThe Company may seek in the future to distribute taxable dividends that are payable in cash and common shares, at the election of each shareholder. Taxable shareholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income to the extent of the Company\u2019s current and accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes, however, generally a shareholder will receive a taxable income deduction for 20% of all ordinary dividends received from a REIT. As a result, shareholders may be required to pay income taxes with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividends received. If a U.S. shareholder sells the common shares that it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of common shares at the time of the sale. In addition, in such case, a U.S. shareholder could have a capital loss with respect to the common shares sold that could not be used to offset such dividend income. Furthermore, with respect to certain non-U.S. shareholders, the Company may be required to withhold U.S. federal income tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in common shares. In addition, such a taxable share dividend could be viewed as equivalent to a reduction in the Company\u2019s cash distributions, and that factor, as well as the possibility that a significant number of the Company\u2019s shareholders could determine to sell the common shares in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, may put downward pressure on the market price of the Company\u2019s common shares.\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\nIf the Company\u2019s leases are not respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company would likely fail to qualify as a REIT.\n\n\nTo qualify as a REIT, the Company must satisfy two gross income tests, pursuant to which specified percentages of the Company\u2019s gross income must be passive income, such as rent. For the rent paid pursuant to the hotel leases with the Company\u2019s TRSs, which the Company currently expects will continue to constitute substantially all of the REIT\u2019s gross income, to qualify for purposes of the gross income tests, the leases must be respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes and must not be treated as service contracts, joint ventures or some other type of arrangement. The Company believes that the leases have been and will continue to be respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes. There can be no assurance, however, that the IRS will agree with this characterization. If the leases were not respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company may not be able to satisfy either of the two gross income tests applicable to REITs and may lose its REIT status. Additionally, the Company could be subject to a 100% excise tax for any adjustment to its leases.\n\n\nIf any of the hotel management companies that the Company\u2019s TRSs engage do not qualify as \u201celigible independent contractors,\u201d or if the Company\u2019s hotels are not \u201cqualified lodging facilities,\u201d the Company would likely fail to qualify as a REIT.\n\n\nRent paid by a lessee that is a \u201crelated party tenant\u201d of the Company generally will not be qualifying income for purposes of the two gross income tests applicable to REITs. An exception is provided, however, for leases of \u201cqualified lodging facilities\u201d to a TRS so long as the hotels are managed by an \u201celigible independent contractor\u201d and certain other requirements are satisfied. The Company intends to continue to take advantage of this exception. A \u201cqualified lodging facility\u201d is a hotel, motel, or other establishment more than one-half of the dwelling units in which are used on a transient basis, including customary amenities and facilities, provided that no wagering activities are conducted at or in connection with such facility by any person who is engaged in the business of accepting wagers and who is legally authorized to engage in such business at or in connection with such facility. Although the Company intends to monitor future acquisitions and improvements of hotels, the REIT provisions of the Code provide only limited guidance for making determinations under the requirements for \u201cqualified lodging facilities,\u201d and there can be no assurance that these requirements will be satisfied in all cases.\n\n\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s TRS lessees have engaged hotel management companies that are intended to qualify as \u201celigible independent contractors.\u201d Among other requirements, in order to qualify as an \u201celigible independent contractor,\u201d the hotel management company must not own, directly or through its shareholders, more than 35% of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares, and no person or group of persons can own more than 35% of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares and the shares (or ownership interest) of the hotel management company (taking into account certain ownership attribution rules). The ownership attribution rules that apply for purposes of these 35% thresholds are complex, and monitoring actual and constructive ownership of the Company\u2019s shares by the hotel management companies and their owners may not be practical. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that these ownership levels will not be exceeded. In addition, for a hotel management company to qualify as an \u201celigible independent contractor,\u201d such company or a related person must be actively engaged in the trade or business of operating \u201cqualified lodging facilities\u201d (as defined above) for one or more persons not related to the REIT or its TRSs at each time that such company enters into a hotel management contract with a TRS. As of the date hereof, the Company believes the hotel management companies operate \u201cqualified lodging facilities\u201d for certain persons who are not related to the Company or its TRSs. However, no assurances can be provided that this will continue to be the case or that any other hotel management companies that the Company may engage in the future will in fact comply with this requirement in the future. \n\n\nThe Company\u2019s ownership of TRSs is limited,\n \nand the Company\u2019s transactions with its TRSs will cause it to be subject to a 100% penalty tax on certain income or deductions if those transactions are not conducted on arm\u2019s-length terms.\n\n\nA REIT may own up to 100% of the stock of one or more TRSs. A TRS may hold assets and earn income that would not be qualifying assets or income if held or earned directly by a REIT. Both the subsidiary and the REIT must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a TRS. A corporation of which a TRS directly or indirectly owns more than 35% of the voting power or value of the stock will automatically be treated as a TRS. Overall, no more than 20% of the value of a REIT\u2019s assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRSs. The rules also impose a 100% excise tax on certain transactions, including the leases, between the TRS and the REIT that are not conducted on an arm\u2019s-length basis.\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s TRSs will pay U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on their net taxable income, and their after-tax net income will be available for distribution to the REIT, but is not required to be distributed. The Company has monitored and will continue to monitor the value of its respective investments in its TRSs for the purpose of ensuring \n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\ncompliance with the ownership limitations applicable to TRSs.\n \nIn addition, the Company will\n continue to\n scrutinize all of its transactions with its TRSs to ensure that they are entered into on arm\n\u2019\ns-length terms to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax.\n \nThere can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be able to comply with the \nrules regarding TRSs\n or avoid application of the 100% excise tax.\n \nThe most significant transactions between the Company and its TRSs are the hotel leases from the Company to its TRSs.\n \nWhile the Company believes its leases have customary terms and reflect normal business practices and that the rents paid thereto reflect market terms, there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree.\n\n\nComplying with REIT requirements may force the Company to forgo and/or liquidate otherwise attractive investment opportunities.\n\n\nTo qualify as a REIT, the Company must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of its income, the nature and diversification of its assets, the amount it distributes to its shareholders and the ownership of its common shares. \nIn order to meet these tests, the Company \nmay be required to liquidate from its portfolio, or contribute to a TRS, otherwise attractive investments in order to maintain its qualification as a REIT. These actions could have the effect of reducing the Company\u2019s income and amounts available for distribution to its shareholders. In addition, the Company may be required to make distributions to shareholders at disadvantageous times or when the Company does not have funds readily available for distribution, and may be unable to pursue investments that would otherwise be advantageous to it in order to satisfy the source of income or asset diversification requirements for qualifying as a REIT. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder the Company\u2019s ability to make, and, in certain cases, maintain ownership of, certain attractive investments.\n\n\nThe Company may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes.\n\n\nThe IRS, the U.S. Treasury Department and Congress frequently review U.S. federal income tax legislation, regulations and other guidance. At any time, the U.S. federal income tax laws governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended or modified. The Company cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new U.S. federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be adopted or modified. Changes to the tax laws, including the possibility of major tax legislation, possibly with retroactive application, may adversely affect taxation of the Company or the Company\u2019s shareholders. The Company urges shareholders and prospective shareholders to consult with their tax advisors with respect to the status of legislative, regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in the Company\u2019s shares. Although REITs generally receive certain tax advantages compared to entities taxed as C corporations, it is possible that future legislation would result in a REIT having fewer tax advantages, and it could become more advantageous for a company that invests in real estate to elect to be treated as a C corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n \n\n\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\n\nThe Company may change its distribution policy or may not have funds available to make distributions to shareholders. \n\n\nThe Board of Directors will continue to evaluate the Company\u2019s distribution policy in conjunction with the impact of the economy on its operations, actual and projected financial condition and results of operations, capital expenditure requirements and other factors, including those discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While the Company intends to reinstitute a monthly distribution beginning in March 2022, there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to make distributions at any particular time or rate, or at all. Further, there is no assurance that a distribution rate achieved for a particular period will be maintained in the future and may, for example, be suspended or adjusted from time to time to a level determined to be prudent in relation to the Company\u2019s other cash requirements. The Board of Directors evaluates the distribution rate on an ongoing basis and may make changes at any time if it believes the rate is not appropriate based on REIT taxable income, limitations under financing arrangements, or other cash needs. A suspension of or reduction in the Company\u2019s distribution rate could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the Company\u2019s common shares. \n\n\nFurther, while the Company generally seeks to make distributions from its operating cash flows, distributions may be made (although there is no obligation to do so) in certain circumstances, in part, from financing proceeds or other sources. While distributions made from such sources would result in the shareholder receiving cash, the consequences to the shareholders would differ from a distribution made from the Company\u2019s operating cash flows. For example, if debt financing is the source of a distribution, that financing would not be available for other opportunities, would have to be repaid and interest would accrue on the financing.\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\nThe market price \nand \ntrading\n volume \nof the Company\u2019s common shares may fluctuate widely \nand could decline substantially in the future\n. \n\n\nThe Company\u2019s common shares are listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol \u201cAPLE.\u201d The market price and trading volume of the Company\u2019s common shares may fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond the Company\u2019s control, including: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nactual versus anticipated differences in the Company\u2019s operating results, liquidity, or financial condition;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\npublication of research reports about the Company, its hotels or the lodging or overall real estate industry;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nchanges in and/or failure to meet analysts\u2019 revenue or earnings estimates;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe reputation of REITs and real estate investments generally, and the attractiveness of REIT equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate companies, and fixed income instruments; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nchanges in accounting principles or other laws and regulations that may adversely affect the Company or its industry;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nstrategic actions by the Company or its competitors, such as acquisitions or dispositions, and announcements by franchisors, operators or REITs and other owners in the hospitality industry;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nfluctuations in the stock price and operating results of the Company\u2019s competitors; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe realization of any of the other risk factors presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\nStock markets in general have historically experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company or industry. Similar broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price and volume of the Company\u2019s common shares. \n\n\nFuture offerings or the perception that future offerings could occur may adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common shares and future offerings may be dilutive to existing shareholders. \n\n\nThe Company has in the past and may in the future issue additional common shares. Proceeds from any issuance may be used to finance hotel acquisitions, fund capital expenditures, pay down outstanding debt, or for other corporate purposes. A large volume of sales of the Company\u2019s common shares could decrease the market price of the Company\u2019s common shares and could impair the Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities in the future. Also, a perception of the possibility of a substantial sale of common shares could depress the market price of the Company\u2019s common shares and have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s ability to raise capital in the future. In addition, anticipated downward pressure on the price of the Company\u2019s common shares due to actual or anticipated sales of common shares could cause some institutions or individuals to engage in short sales of the common shares, which may itself cause the price of the common shares to decline. \nBecause the Company\u2019s decision to issue equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond its control, the Company cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of its future offerings. Therefore, the Company\u2019s shareholders bear the risk of the Company\u2019s future offerings reducing the market price of its common shares and diluting shareholders equity interests in the Company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "item7": ">Item 7\n, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\n of the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended \nDecember\u00a031, 2020\n, filed with the SEC on February \n2\n3\n, 20\n2\n1\n, \nwhich is incorporated herein by reference and \nwhich is available free of charge on the SEC\u2019s website\n at \nwww.sec.gov\n and in the Investor Information section of the Company\u2019s website at www.applehospitalityreit.com.\n\n\nRevenues\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s principal source of revenue is hotel revenue consisting of room, food and beverage, and other related revenue.\u00a0For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had total revenue of $933.9 million and $601.9 million, respectively.\u00a0For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, Comparable Hotels achieved combined average occupancy of 66.3% and 45.9%, ADR of $125.43 and $112.72 and RevPAR of $83.14 and $51.69. \nADR is calculated as room revenue divided by the number of rooms sold, and RevPAR is calculated as occupancy multiplied by ADR.\n\n\nCompared to 2020, the Company experienced increases in ADR and occupancy in 2021, resulting in an increase of 60.8% in RevPAR, for Comparable Hotels. As compared to 2019 (pre-COVID-19), Comparable Hotels RevPAR for 2021 decreased by 23.6% as a result of a 14.1% reduction in occupancy and an 11.1% decrease in ADR. During March 2020, the hotel industry and the Company began to see a significant decrease in occupancy as both mandated and voluntary restrictions on travel were implemented throughout the U.S. For Comparable Hotels, average occupancy fell below 50% for most of 2020 before improving to 66.3% in 2021 driven predominately by increased leisure demand as a result of improved consumer confidence in travel and the lifting of some COVID-19 mitigation restrictions, but also by increased demand from a wide variety of demand generators such as government, healthcare, automotive, construction, disaster recovery, insurance, athletics, education and local and regional business-related travel. Revenue recovery in 2021 was led by leisure transient and group demand, with increased demand from small corporate and government business. Suburban markets continued to see stronger demand than urban markets. Throughout the hospitality industry, demand for upscale and upper midscale chain scales have outperformed luxury and upper upscale chain scales and suburban locations have outperformed urban locations. As noted above, the Company expects this trend to gradually continue, however, future revenues could be negatively impacted by, among other things, historical seasonal trends, an increase in COVID-19 cases, new COVID-19 variants, state and local governments and businesses reverting to tighter mitigation restrictions, or deterioration of consumer sentiment.\n \n\n\nHotel Operating Expense\n\n\nThe Company, its management companies and the brands the Company\u2019s hotels are franchised with have all aggressively worked to mitigate costs and uses of cash associated with operating the hotels in the low-occupancy environment experienced in 2020, have worked to maintain cost-reduction practices where feasible as the economy recovers, and are thoughtfully working to position the hotels to adapt to the changes that may occur to guest preferences in the future. The impact of the pandemic has varied and will continue to vary by market and hotel. With the support of its brands and third-party management companies, the Company will continue to evaluate and implement adjustments to the hotel operating model in response to continued changes in the operating environment and guest preferences.\n\n\nHotel operating expense consists of direct room operating expense, hotel administrative expense, sales and marketing expense, utilities expense, repair and maintenance expense, franchise fees and management fees.\u00a0For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, hotel operating expense totaled $542.2 million and $402.3 million, respectively, or 58.1% and 66.8% of total revenue for each respective year. Comparatively, prior to COVID-19, hotel operating expense was 57.2% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. \nThe Company has worked and will continue to work with its management companies to optimize staffing models and adjust food and beverage offerings and other amenities, among other efficiency initiatives, to mitigate the impact of revenue declines and cost pressures on its results of operations. For example, the Company has reduced service and amenity offerings as allowed by the relaxation of certain brand standards and the Company also successfully reduced rates under various service contracts. Although certain operating costs of a hotel are more fixed in nature, such as base utility and maintenance costs, the Company has worked and will continue to work to reduce all non-essential costs including service contracts, utilities in areas not utilized and certain maintenance costs. However, the Company may continue to see ongoing cost increases related to both labor and supplies due to scarcity. \nAs occupancy has increased throughout 2021, increasing staffing to meet increased demand has been challenging, and while the Company\u2019s hotels made progress in filling open positions during the second half of 2021, they have often done so at higher wage rates. Likewise, supply chain disruptions and broader inflationary pressures throughout the overall economy have driven shortages and increases in the cost of materials and supplies such as food and equipment.\n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\nProperty Taxes, Insurance and Other Expense\n\n\nProperty taxes, insurance and other expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 totaled $72.0 million and $78.2 million, respectively, or 7.7% and 13.0% of total revenue for each respective year, which is consistent with Comparable Hotels expense as a percentage of revenue for the same period. Prior to COVID-19, property taxes, insurance and other expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled $77.5 million or 6.1% of total revenue. The decrease in expenses from 2019 and 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to decreases in property taxes in certain localities as well as the reduction of the hotel portfolio by 15 properties during 2021. \nAlthough the Company will continue to aggressively appeal tax assessments in certain jurisdictions in an attempt to minimize tax increases, as warranted, and will continue to monitor locality guidance as a result of COVID-19, it does not currently anticipate significant decreases in property taxes in 2022 as compared to 2021.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \n\n\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\n\n\nGeneral and administrative expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $41.0 million and $29.4 million, respectively, or 4.4% and 4.9% of total revenue for each respective year. The principal components of general and administrative expense are payroll and related benefit costs, legal fees, accounting fees and reporting expenses.\n The increase in g\neneral and administrative expense in 2021 as compared to 2020 was \nprimarily due to increased accruals of $12.4 million for executive incentive compensation related to higher shareholder return and operating performance in 2021 as compared to 2020 (see Note 8 titled \u201cCompensation Plans\u201d of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto in Part II, Item 8, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional details).\u00a0Additionally, \nin order to minimize costs in 2020, the Company\u2019s Executive Chairman voluntarily agreed to forego six months of salary, the Chief Executive Officer volunteered to reduce his target compensation by 60 percent and the non-employee directors on the Board of Directors volunteered as a group to reduce their annual director fees by more than 15 percent. \n\n\nLoss on Impairment of Depreciable Real Estate Assets\n\n\nLoss on impairment of depreciable real estate assets was $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, \nconsisting of impairment losses of $1.3 million for the Overland Park, Kansas SpringHill Suites and $9.4 million for four hotel properties identified by the Company in the first quarter of 2021 for potential sale. \nLoss on impairment of depreciable real estate assets was\n \n$5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 \nfor the Memphis, Tennessee Homewood Suites\n. See Note 3, titled \u201cDispositions\u201d \nof the \nConsolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto in \nPart II, Item 8\n, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information concerning these impairment losses.\n\n\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\n\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $184.5 million and $199.8 million, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense primarily represents expense of the Company\u2019s hotel buildings and related improvements, and associated personal property (furniture, fixtures, and equipment) for their respective periods owned. The\u00a0decrease was primarily due to limited renovation activity and the sale of 23 hotels in 2021 and three hotels in 2020, partially offset by the acquisition of eight hotels in 2021 and four hotels in 2020. Additionally, depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 includes approximately $5.2 million and $6.4 million, respectively, of expense associated with amortization of the Company\u2019s finance ground leases.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nInterest and Other Expense, net\n\n\nInterest and other expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $67.7 million and $70.8 million, respectively, and is net of approximately $0.3 million and $0.9 million, respectively, of interest capitalized associated with renovation projects.\n Additionally, interest and other expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2021 and \n2020\n includes approximately $9.4 million and $11.4 million, respectively, of interest recorded on the Company\u2019s finance lease liabilities.\n\n\nInterest expense related to the Company\u2019s debt instruments decreased as a result of lower average borrowings under the Company\u2019s unsecured credit facilities with similar average interest rates in 2021 as compared to 2020. See Note 4 titled \u201cDebt\u201d of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto in Part II, Item 8, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional discussion of the Company\u2019s amended unsecured credit facilities. In addition to decreases in interest due to lower average borrowings under the Company\u2019s unsecured credit facilities, interest on the Company\u2019s finance leases decreased approximately $2.0 million during 2021 as compared to 2020 due to the August 16, 2021 purchase of the fee interest in the land at the Company\u2019s Seattle, Washington Residence Inn that was previously under a ground lease.\n\n\n43\n\n\n\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\n\nThe Company considers the following non-GAAP financial measures useful to investors as key supplemental measures of its operating performance: Funds from Operations (\u201cFFO\u201d), Modified Funds from Operations (\u201cMFFO\u201d), Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d), Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (\u201cEBITDAre\u201d), Adjusted EBITDAre (\u201cAdjusted EBITDAre\u201d) and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income (loss), cash flow from operations or any other operating GAAP measure. FFO, MFFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA are not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund the Company\u2019s cash needs, including its ability to make cash distributions. Although FFO, MFFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA, as calculated by the Company, may not be comparable to FFO, MFFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA, as reported by other companies that do not define such terms exactly as the Company defines such terms, the Company believes these supplemental measures are useful to investors when comparing the Company\u2019s results between periods and with other REITs.\n\n\nFFO and MFFO\n\n\nThe Company calculates and presents FFO in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\u201cNareit\u201d), which defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets (including gains and losses from change in control), extraordinary items as defined by GAAP, and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, plus real estate related depreciation, amortization and impairments, and adjustments for unconsolidated affiliates. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, most real estate industry investors consider FFO to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company\u2019s operations. The Company further believes that by excluding the effects of these items, FFO is useful to investors in comparing its operating performance between periods and between REITs that report FFO using the Nareit definition. FFO as presented by the Company is applicable only to its common shareholders, but does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common shareholders.\n\n\nThe Company calculates MFFO by further adjusting FFO for the exclusion of amortization of finance ground lease assets, amortization of favorable and unfavorable operating leases, net and non-cash straight-line operating ground lease expense, as these expenses do not reflect the underlying performance of the related hotels. The Company presents MFFO when evaluating its performance because it believes that it provides further useful supplemental information to investors regarding its ongoing operating performance.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThe following table reconciles the Company\u2019s GAAP net income (loss) to FFO and MFFO for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2019\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income (loss)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n18,828\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n(173,207\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n171,917\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepreciation of real estate owned\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n179,275\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n192,346\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n187,729\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGain on sale of real estate\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(3,596\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(10,854\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(5,021\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoss on impairment of depreciable real estate assets\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n10,754\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n5,097\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n6,467\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunds from operations\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n205,261\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n13,382\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n361,092\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmortization of finance ground lease assets\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n5,178\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n6,433\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n4,517\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmortization of favorable and unfavorable operating\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 leases, net\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n393\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n442\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n124\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-cash straight-line operating ground lease expense\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n169\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n180\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n188\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModified funds from operations\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n211,001\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n20,437\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n365,921\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n44\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA\n\n\nEBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries and is defined as net income (loss) excluding interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company believes EBITDA is useful to investors because it helps the Company and its investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of the Company by removing the impact of its capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). In addition, certain covenants included in the agreements governing the Company\u2019s indebtedness use EBITDA, as defined in the specific credit agreement, as a measure of financial compliance.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition to EBITDA, the Company also calculates and presents EBITDAre\u00a0in accordance with standards established by Nareit, which defines EBITDAre\u00a0as EBITDA, excluding gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets (including gains and losses from change in control), plus real estate related impairments, and adjustments to reflect the entity\u2019s share of EBITDAre\u00a0of unconsolidated affiliates. The Company presents EBITDAre\u00a0because it believes that it provides further useful information to investors in comparing its operating performance between periods and between REITs that report EBITDAre using the Nareit definition.\n\n\nThe Company also considers the exclusion of \nnon-cash straight-line operating ground lease expense\n from EBITDAre useful, \nas this expense \ndoes not reflect the underlying performance of the related hotels (Adjusted EBITDAre).\n\n\nThe Company further excludes \nactual corporate-level general and administrative expense for the Company from Adjusted EBITDAre (Adjusted Hotel EBITDA) to isolate property-level operational performance over which the Company\u2019s hotel operators have direct control. The Company believes Adjusted Hotel EBITDA provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding operating performance and is used by management to measure the performance of the Company\u2019s hotels and effectiveness of the operators of the hotels.\u00a0\n\n\nThe following table reconciles the Company\u2019s GAAP net income (loss) to EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre and

Owned \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, the Company owned 219 hotels with an aggregate of 28,747 rooms located in 36 states. See \u201cManagement and Franchise Agreements\u201d in Part I, Item 1, Business, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a table summarizing the number of hotels and rooms by brand. Refer to Part I, Item 2, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for tables summarizing the number of hotels and rooms by state, and summarizing the location, brand, manager, date acquired or completed and number of rooms for each of the 219 hotels the Company owned as of December\u00a031, 2021.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nRelated Parties\n \n\n\nThe Company has, and is expected to continue to engage in, transactions with related parties. These transactions cannot be construed to be at arm\u2019s length and the results of the Company\u2019s operations may be different if these transactions were conducted with non-related parties. See Note 6, titled \u201cRelated Parties\u201d of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto in Part II, Item 8, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information concerning the Company\u2019s related party transactions.\n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCapital Resources \n\n\nThe Company\u2019s principal short term sources of liquidity are the operating cash flows generated from the Company\u2019s properties and availability under its revolving credit facility. Over the long term, the Company may receive proceeds from strategic additional secured and unsecured debt financing, dispositions of its hotel properties (such as the sale of 23 hotels in 2021 for proceeds of approximately $234.6 million discussed above in \u201cRecent Hotel Portfolio Activities\u201d) and offerings of the Company\u2019s common shares, including pursuant to the ATM Program (as defined below).\n\n\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, the Company had approximately $1.4 billion of total outstanding debt consisting of $498.0 million of mortgage debt and $946.0 million outstanding under its credit facilities, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs and fair value adjustments. As of December\u00a031, 2021, the Company had available corporate cash on hand of approximately $3.3 million as well as unused borrowing capacity under its $425 million revolving credit facility of approximately $349.0 million. \nIn the near term, the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy, including any sustained decline in the Company\u2019s performance, may make it more difficult or costly for the Company to raise debt or equity capital to fund long-term liquidity requirements. The credit agreements governing the unsecured credit facilities contain mandatory prepayment requirements, customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default.\u00a0The credit agreements require that the Company comply with various covenants, which include, among others, a minimum tangible net worth, maximum debt limits, minimum interest and fixed charge coverage ratios, and restrictions on certain investments.\u00a0\n\n\nAs a result of COVID-19 and the associated disruption to the Company\u2019s operating results, the Company entered into amendments in June 2020 that suspended the testing of the Company\u2019s existing financial maintenance covenants under the unsecured credit facilities. These amendments \nimposed certain restrictions regarding its investing and financing activities including, but not limited to, limitations on the acquisition of property, payment of distributions to shareholders (except to the extent required to maintain REIT status), capital expenditures and use of proceeds from the sale of property or common shares of the Company, that applied during such testing suspension period. On March 1, 2021, as a result of the continued disruption from COVID-19 and the related uncertainty with respect to the Company\u2019s future operating results, the Company entered into further amendments to each of the unsecured credit facilities to extend the covenant waiver period for all but two of the Company\u2019s existing financial maintenance covenants \nuntil the date that the compliance certificate was required to be delivered for the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2022 (unless the Company elected an earlier date) (the \u201cExtended Covenant Waiver Period\u201d). \nThe testing for the Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and the Minimum Unsecured Interest Coverage Ratio was suspended until the compliance certificate was required to be delivered for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2022 (unless the Company elected an earlier date). The amendment provided for continued restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability to make cash distributions, except for the payment of cash dividends of $0.01 per common share per quarter or to the extent required to maintain REIT status.\n\n\nAdditionally, these amendments modified the calculation of the existing financial covenants for the first three quarterly calculations subsequent to the end of the Extended Covenant Waiver Period to annualize calculated amounts based on the period beginning with the first fiscal quarter upon exiting the Extended Covenant Waiver Period through the most recently ended fiscal quarter. The March 2021 amendments also\u00a0modified\u00a0certain of the existing financial maintenance covenants to \n\n\n47\n\n\n\n\nless restrictive levels\u00a0upon exiting\u00a0the Extended Covenant Waiver Period as follows\u00a0(capitalized terms are defined in the credit agreements):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nMaximum \nConsolidated Leverage Ratio of 8.50 to 1.00 for the first two fiscal quarters, 8.00 to 1.00 for two fiscal quarters, 7.50 to 1.00 for one fiscal quarter and then a ratio of 6.50 to 1.00 thereafter\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nMinimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.05 to 1.00 for the first fiscal quarter, 1.25 to 1.00 for one fiscal quarter and then a ratio of 1.50 to 1.00 thereafter\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nMinimum Unsecured Interest Coverage Ratio of no less than 1.25 to 1.00 for one fiscal quarter, 1.50 to 1.00 for one fiscal quarter, 1.75 to 1.00 for one fiscal quarter and a ratio of 2.00 to 1.00 thereafter\n; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nMaximum Unsecured Leverage Ratio of 65% for two fiscal quarters and 60% thereafter\n.\n\n\nExcept as otherwise set forth in the amendments, the terms of the credit agreements remain in effect.\n\n\nIn July 2021, the Company notified its lenders under its unsecured credit facilities that it had elected to exit the Extended Covenant Waiver Period effective on July 29, 2021. Upon exiting the Extended Covenant Waiver Period, the Company is no longer subject to the restrictions described above regarding its investing and financing activities that were applicable during the Extended Covenant Waiver Period, including, but not limited to, limitations on the acquisition of property, payment of distributions to shareholders, capital expenditures and use of proceeds from the sale of property or common shares of the Company. Those restrictions, including the restriction on payment of distributions to shareholders, were still in place throughout the second quarter of 2021.\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s annualized results for the nine months ended December 31, 2021 met the financial maintenance covenants based on the thresholds stipulated for the third fiscal quarter tested upon exiting the Extended Covenant Waiver Period as described in Note 4 titled \u201cDebt\u201d\u00a0of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto in Part II, Item 8, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The unsecured credit facilities do not provide the Company the ability to re-enter the Extended Covenant Waiver Period once it has elected to exit.\n\n\nSee Note 4 titled \u201cDebt\u201d of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto in Part II, Item 8, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a description of the Company\u2019s debt instruments as of December\u00a031, 2021.\n\n\nThe Company has a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-231021) that was automatically effective upon filing on April 25, 2019.\u00a0The Company may offer an indeterminate number or amount, as the case may be, of (1) common shares, no par value per share; (2) preferred shares, no par value per share; (3) depository shares representing the Company\u2019s preferred shares; (4) warrants exercisable for the Company\u2019s common shares, preferred shares or depository shares representing preferred shares; (5) rights to purchase common shares; and (6) unsecured senior or subordinate debt securities, all of which may be issued from time to time on a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act.\u00a0Future offerings will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company, including market conditions, the trading price of the Company\u2019s common shares and opportunities for uses of any proceeds. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn connection with the shelf registration statement, on August 12, 2020, the Company entered into an equity distribution agreement pursuant to which the Company may sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $300\u00a0million of its common shares under an at-the-market offering program (the \u201cATM Program\u201d). As of December\u00a031, 2021, the Company had sold approximately 4.7 million common shares under its ATM Program at a weighted-average market sales \nprice of approximately $16.26 per common share and received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $76.0 million and proceeds net of offering costs, which included $0.9 million of commissions, of approximately $75.1 million.\n The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of these shares primarily to pay down borrowings under its revolving credit facility and used the corresponding increased availability under the revolving credit facility \nfor general corporate purposes, including acquisitions of hotel properties\n. \nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately $224.0 million remained available for issuance under the ATM Program. The Company plans to use future net proceeds from the sale of these shares to continue to pay down borrowings under its revolving credit facility (if any).\n The Company plans to use the corresponding increased availability under the revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes which may include, among other things, acquisitions of additional properties, the repayment of other outstanding indebtedness, capital expenditures, improvement of properties in its portfolio and working capital. The Company may also use the net proceeds to acquire another REIT or other company that invests in income producing properties.\n\n\n48\n\n\n\n\nCapital Uses\n \n\n\nThe Company anticipates that cash flow from operations, availability under its credit facilities, additional borrowings and proceeds from hotel dispositions and equity offerings will be adequate to meet its\u00a0anticipated liquidity requirements, including debt service, hotel acquisitions, hotel renovations, share repurchases, and required distributions to shareholders. \n\n\nDistributions\n\n\nThe Company generally must distribute annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gain, in order to maintain its REIT status.\u00a0\nSubsequent to the distribution paid in March 2020, the Company announced the suspension of its monthly distributions due to the impact of COVID-19 on its operating cash flows. \nAs discussed in Note 4 titled \u201cDebt\u201d of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto in Part II, Item 8, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, d\nuring the Extended Covenant Waiver Period,\u00a0\nas a\n\u00a0requirement under the amendments to its unsecured credit facilities, the Company was restricted in its ability to make distributions except for the payment of cash distributions of $0.01 per common share per quarter or to the extent required to maintain REIT status. Beginning in March 2021, the Board of Directors declared distributions of $0.01 per common share in the last month of each quarter and the distributions were paid out each following month. \nIn July 2021, the Company notified its lenders under its unsecured credit facilities that it had elected to exit the Extended Covenant Waiver Period effective on July 29, 2021. As a result, upon exiting the Extended Covenant Waiver Period, the Company is no longer subject to the restrictions on distributions that were applicable during the Extended Covenant Waiver Period. \nDistributions paid for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $0.03, $0.30 and $1.20 per common share, respectively, for a total of approximately $6.8 million, $67.4 million and $268.7 million, respectively. The quarterly distribution declared in December 2021 totaled $2.3 million and was paid on January 18, 2022. \n\n\nOn February 22, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors has reinstated its policy of distributions on a monthly basis and declared a monthly cash distribution of $0.05 per common share for the month of March, payable on March 15, 2022. While the Company currently expects monthly distributions to continue, each distribution is subject to approval by the Board of Directors. \nThe Company\u2019s Board of Directors, in consultation with management, will continue to monitor hotel operations as well as the timing and level of distributions in relation to the Company\u2019s other cash requirements or in order to maintain its REIT status for federal income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had a net loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes of approximately $35.8 million which may be applied to future taxable earnings subject to limitations imposed by the Code, which will reduce the amount of distributions necessary to maintain the Company\u2019s REIT status. \n\n\nShare Repurchases\n\n\nIn May 2021, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors approved an extension of its existing Share Repurchase Program, authorizing share repurchases up to an aggregate of $345\u00a0million. The Share Repurchase Program may be suspended or terminated at any time by the Company and will end in July 2022 if not terminated earlier or extended. No common shares were repurchased in 2021. During 2020 and 2019, the Company purchased, under its Share Repurchase Program, approximately 1.5 million and 0.3 million of its common shares, respectively, at a weighted-average market purchase price of approximately $9.42 and $14.92 per common share, respectively, for an aggregate purchase price, including commissions, of approximately $14.3 million and $4.3 million, respectively. The shares were repurchased under a written trading plan that provided for share repurchases in open market transactions and was intended to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. Past repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program have been funded, and the Company intends to fund future repurchases, with cash on hand or availability under its unsecured credit facilities, subject to applicable restrictions under the Company\u2019s unsecured credit facilities (if any). The timing of share repurchases and the number of common shares to be repurchased under the Share Repurchase Program will also depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory requirements and other factors.\n\n\nCapital Improvements\n\n\nManagement routinely monitors the condition and operations of its hotels and plans renovations and other improvements as it deems prudent. The Company has ongoing capital commitments to fund its capital improvements.\u00a0To maintain and enhance each property\u2019s competitive position in its market, the Company has invested in and plans to continue to reinvest in its hotels. Under certain loan and management agreements, the Company is required to place in escrow funds for the repair, replacement and refurbishing of furniture, fixtures, and equipment, based on a percentage of gross revenues, provided that such amount may be used for the Company\u2019s capital expenditures with respect to the hotels.\u00a0As of December\u00a031, 2021, the Company held approximately $29.3 million in reserve related to these properties. During 2021, the Company invested approximately $25.8 million in capital expenditures and anticipates spending approximately $55 to $65 \n\n\n49\n\n\n\n\nmillion during 2022, which includes various renovation projects for approximately \n20 \nto \n25 \nproperties.\n \nThe Company does not currently have any existing or planned projects for\n new property\n development.\n\n\nUpcoming Debt Maturities and Debt Service Payments\n\n\nThe Company has approximately $287.1 million of principal and interest payments due on its debt over the next 12 months. Included in this total is $76.0 million due on the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility, which matures on July 27, 2022, but the facility can be extended up to one year, subject to certain conditions including covenant compliance and additional fees. The Company presently has the intent and ability to exercise this extension. Also included is approximately $155.7 million of mortgage loans maturing in the second half of 2022, which the Company plans to pay off using borrowings under its revolving credit facility and/or new financing. See Note 4 titled \u201cDebt\u201d of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto in Part II, Item 8, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for more detail regarding future maturities of the Company\u2019s debt instruments as of December\u00a031, 2021.\n\n\nHotel Purchase Contract Commitments\n\n\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, the Company had one outstanding contract, which was entered into during 2021, for the potential purchase of a hotel currently under development for a total expected purchase price of approximately $78.6 million. The hotel is expected to be completed as a 260-room Embassy\n \nSuites and opened for business in early 2024, at which time the Company expects to complete the purchase of this hotel. \nAlthough the Company is working towards acquiring this hotel, there are many conditions to closing that have not yet been satisfied and there can be no assurance that closing on this hotel will occur under the outstanding purchase contract.\n The Company plans to utilize its available cash or borrowings under its unsecured credit facilities available at closing to purchase the hotel.\n\n\nLease Commitments\n\n\nThe Company is the lessee on certain ground leases, hotel equipment leases and office space leases. As of December\u00a031, 2021, the Company had 14 hotels subject to ground leases and three parking lot ground leases with remaining terms ranging from approximately two to 97 years, excluding renewal options. Certain of its ground leases have options to extend beyond the initial lease term by periods ranging from five to 120 years. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has total remaining minimum lease payments of $296.8 million, including $6.7 million due in the next year. Refer to Note 10, titled \u201cLease Commitments\u201d of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto in Part II, Item 8, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details. \n\n\nCash Management Activities\n\n\nAs part of the cost sharing arrangements discussed in Note 6, titled \u201cRelated Parties\u201d of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto in Part II, Item 8, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, certain day-to-day transactions may result in amounts due to or from the Company and ARG. To efficiently manage cash disbursements, the Company or ARG may make payments for the other company. Under the cash management process, each company may advance or defer up to $1 million at any time. Each quarter, any outstanding amounts are settled between the companies. This process allows each company to minimize its cash on hand and reduces the cost for each company. The amounts outstanding at any point in time are not significant to either of the companies.\n\n\nManagement and Franchise Agreements \n\n\nEach of the Company\u2019s 219 hotels owned as of December\u00a031, 2021 is operated and managed under separate management agreements with 16 hotel management companies, none of which are affiliated with the Company. Thirteen of the Company\u2019s hotels are managed by affiliates of Marriott. The remainder of the Company\u2019s hotels are managed by companies that are not affiliated with either Marriott, Hilton or Hyatt, and as a result, the branded hotels they manage were required to obtain separate franchise agreements with the applicable franchisor. See Note 9, titled \u201cManagement and Franchise Agreements\u201d of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto in Part II, Item 8, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information pertaining to the management and franchise agreements, including a listing of the Company\u2019s hotel management companies. \n\n\nBusiness Interruption \n\n\nBeing in the real estate industry, the Company is exposed to natural disasters on both a local and national scale. Although management believes it has adequate insurance to cover this exposure, there can be no assurance that such events will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position or results of operations.\n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\nSeasonality \n\n\nThe hotel industry has been historically seasonal in nature. Seasonal variations in occupancy at the Company\u2019s hotels may cause quarterly fluctuations in its revenues. Generally, occupancy rates and hotel revenues for the Company\u2019s hotels are greater in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters. However, due to the effects of COVID-19, these typical seasonal patterns were disrupted in 2020 and 2021, although the Company experienced some seasonal decrease in demand in the first and fourth quarter of each year.\u00a0To the extent that cash flow from operations is insufficient during any quarter, due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenue, the Company expects to utilize cash on hand or available financing sources to meet cash requirements.\n\n\nCritical Accounting Policies \nand Estimates\n\n\nThe following contains a discussion of what the Company believes to be its critical accounting policies and estimates. These items should be read to gain a further understanding of the principles and estimates used to prepare the Company\u2019s financial statements. These principles and estimates include application of judgment; therefore, changes in judgments may have a material impact on the Company\u2019s reported results of operations and financial condition. \n\n\nInvestment Policy\n\n\nUpon acquisition of real estate properties, the Company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, buildings and improvements, and furniture, fixtures and equipment) and identified intangible assets and liabilities, including in-place leases, and assumed debt based on the evaluation of information and estimates available at that date. Fair values for these assets are not directly observable and estimates are based on comparables and other information which is subjective in nature\n,\n including comparable land sales as well as industry and Company data regarding building and furniture, fixture and equipment costs, including adjustments for estimated depreciation based on the age of the property acquired and time since its most recent renovation. The Company has not assigned any value to management contracts and franchise agreements as such contracts are generally at current market rates based on the remaining terms of the contracts and any other value attributable to these contracts is not considered material. Acquisitions of hotel properties are generally accounted for as acquisitions of a group of assets, with costs incurred to effect an acquisition, including title, legal, accounting, brokerage commissions and other related costs, being capitalized as part of the cost of the assets acquired, instead of accounted for separately as expenses in the period that they are incurred.\n The underlying assumptions are subject to uncertainty and thus any changes to the allocation of fair value to each of the various line items within the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets could have an impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition as well as results of operations due to resulting changes in depreciation and amortization as a result of the fair value allocation. The acquisitions of real estate subject to this estimate totaled eight properties for a combined purchase price of $361.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and four properties for a combined purchase price of $111.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\n\nCapitalization Policy \n\n\nThe Company considers expenditures to be capital in nature based on the following criteria: (1) for a single asset, the cost must be at least $500, including all normal and necessary costs to place the asset in service, and the useful life must be at least one year; (2) for group purchases of 10 or more identical assets, the unit cost for each asset must be at least $50, including all normal and necessary costs to place the asset in service, and the useful life must be at least one year; and (3) for major repairs to a single asset, the repair must be at least $2,500 and the useful life of the asset must be substantially extended. \n\n\nImpairment Losses Policy \n\n\nThe Company records impairment losses on hotel properties used in operations if indicators of impairment are present, and the sum of the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the respective properties over their estimated remaining useful life, based on historical and industry data, is less than the properties\u2019 carrying amount. Indicators of impairment include a property with current or potential losses from operations, when it becomes more likely than not that a property will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when events, trends, contingencies or changes in circumstances indicate that a triggering event has occurred and an asset\u2019s carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company monitors its properties on an ongoing basis by analytically reviewing financial performance and considers each property individually for purposes of reviewing for indicators of impairment. As many indicators of impairment are subjective, such as general economic and market declines, the Company also prepares an annual recoverability analysis for each of its properties to assist with its evaluation of impairment indicators. Given the disruption in 2020 and 2021 caused by COVID-19, the Company has performed over the last two years an annual recoverability analysis by comparing each property\u2019s net book value to its estimated operating income based on assumptions and estimates about the property's future \n\n\n51\n\n\n\n\nrevenues, expenses and capital expenditures after recovery from disruption resulting from COVID-19 and other disruptive events such as renovations or newly opened hotels in the same\n market\n. \nThe Company\u2019s planned initial hold period for each property is generally 39 years. If events or circumstances change, such as the Company\u2019s intended hold period for a property or\n if the\n operating performance of a property\n declines substantially\n for an extended period of time, the Company\u2019s carrying value for a particular property may not be recoverable, and an impairment loss will be recorded. Impairment losses are measured as the difference between the asset\u2019s fair value and its carrying value. \nThe Company\u2019s ongoing analyses and annual recoverability analyses have not identified any impairment losses other than the losses on impairment of \nfive\n propert\nies\n recorded in \n2021\n, \none\n property recorded in \n2020\n and \non\ne\n propert\ny\n recorded in \n2019\n totaling approximately $\n10.\n8\n million, $\n5.1\n \nmillion and $\n6.5\n \nmillion\n, respectively,\n as discussed \nherein in Note \n3\n,\n titled \u201c\nDispositions\n\u201d of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto\n \nin Part II, Item 8\n, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K\n.\n \n\n\nNew Accounting Standards\n\n\nSee Note 1, titled \u201cOrganization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto in Part II, Item 8, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for information on the anticipated adoption of recently issued accounting standards.\n\n\nSubsequent Events \n\n\nOn \nJanuary 18, 2022, the Company paid approximately $2.3 million, or $0.01 per outstanding common share, in distributions to its common shareholders.\n\n\nOn February 22, 2022, the Company declared a monthly cash distribution of $0.05 per common share for the month of March 2022. The distribution is payable on March 15, 2022, to shareholders of record as of March 4, 2022.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n52\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "item7a": ">Item 7A.\n\n\n\n\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \n\n\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, the Company\u2019s financial instruments were not exposed to significant market risk due to foreign currency exchange risk, commodity price risk or equity price risk.\u00a0However, the Company is exposed to interest rate risk due to possible changes in short term interest rates as it invests its cash or borrows on its revolving credit facility and due to the portion of its variable-rate term debt that is not fixed by interest rate swaps.\u00a0As of December\u00a031, 2021, after giving effect to interest rate swaps, as described below, approximately $126.0 million, or approximately 9% of the Company\u2019s total debt outstanding, was subject to variable interest rates. Based on the Company\u2019s variable-rate debt outstanding as of December\u00a031, 2021, every 100 basis points change in interest rates will impact the Company\u2019s annual net income by approximately $0.1 million\n (subject to the LIBOR floor as discussed in Note 4 titled \u201cDebt\u201d in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K), \nall other factors remaining the same.\u00a0With the exception of interest rate swap transactions, the Company has not engaged in transactions in derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments. \n\n\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, the Company\u2019s variable-rate debt consisted of its credit facilities, including borrowings outstanding under its $425 million revolving credit facility and $820 million of term loans.\u00a0Currently, the Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk on a portion of its variable-rate debt. As of December\u00a031, 2021, the Company had 13 interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the interest payments on approximately $770.0 million of the Company\u2019s variable-rate debt outstanding with maturity dates ranging from August 2022 to December 2029. Under the terms of all of the Company\u2019s interest rate swaps, the Company pays a fixed rate of interest and receives a floating rate of interest equal to the one-month LIBOR.\n See Note 5 titled \u201cFair Value of Financial Instruments\u201d in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a description of the Company\u2019s interest rate swaps as of December\u00a031, 2021.\n\n\nIn addition to its variable-rate debt and interest rate swaps discussed above, the Company has assumed or originated fixed interest rate mortgages payable to lenders under permanent financing arrangements as well as one $50 million fixed-rate senior notes facility.\u00a0The following table summarizes the
