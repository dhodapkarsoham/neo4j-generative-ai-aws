{"item1": ">Item 1. Business\u2014\u201cRegulation\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors. We\n      endeavor to mitigate these risks and uncertainties through various measures, including by seeking to understand and obey laws and regulations, training our employees and sales force, engaging in dialogue with government officials to better understand\n      their goals and explain our plans, and cooperating in inquiries and other matters of interest to regulators. However, these efforts do not eliminate the significant risks associated with operating in Mainland China.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\nOur global sales compensation plan and our Mainland China business model, including our related know-how, processes and systems, play a significant role in helping us to attract and incentivize our\n      sales force. We have strategically developed and refined our global sales compensation plan and our Mainland China business model to distinguish the business opportunity that we offer from those of other companies and to seek to provide us with a\n      competitive advantage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSales Incentives, Meetings, Recognition and Training\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn important part of our distribution channel is motivating our Sales Leaders and recognizing their achievements. We hold regular meetings and events globally to recognize Sales Leaders who have\n      achieved various levels of success in our business. These meetings also allow the company and key Sales Leaders to provide training to other Sales Leaders. Although we conduct these meetings and events either virtually or in-person, we are\n      increasingly conducting them virtually\u2014and in 2021, most of them were virtual. We utilize a variety of sales incentives such as incentive trips to motivate Sales Leaders. In addition to rewarding performance, incentive trips provide Sales Leaders and\n      the company opportunities to share best practices and set goals, generate alignment of Sales Leaders around key initiatives and provide a high level of motivation and team building.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Launch Process\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use a variety of methods to launch our products, enabling us to tailor the launch process to the specific market and the specific product. Prior to making a key product generally available for purchase, we may do\n      one or more introductory offerings of the product, such as a preview of the product to our Sales Leaders or other product introduction or promotion. In some of these offerings, we may sell the product for a limited time, often in limited quantities,\n      and then remove it from the market for a period of time before making it generally available for purchase. We refer to this entire process, beginning with the introductory offering through general availability of the product, as a product launch or\n      our launch process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSales Leader previews and other product introductions and promotions may generate significant activity and a high level of purchasing, which can result in a higher-than-normal increase in revenue during the quarter and\n      can skew year-over-year and sequential comparisons. We believe our product launch process attracts new Customers and Sales Leaders to our business, increases consumer trial and provides us with important marketing and forecasting information about\n      our products. \nPlease refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for more information on risks related to our product launch process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeginning in the second half of 2021 and continuing into 2022, we are launching our \nBeauty Focus Collagen+\n skin care supplement and our \nageLOC Meta\n nutritional supplement that helps support metabolic health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGEOGRAPHIC REGIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe currently sell and distribute our Nu Skin business\u2019s products in approximately 50 markets. We have divided our markets into seven segments: \nMainland China; South Korea;\n        Southeast Asia/Pacific, which includes Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand and other markets; Americas, which includes Canada, Latin America and the United States; Japan; Hong Kong/Taiwan,\n        which also includes Macau; and Europe, Middle East and Africa (\u201cEMEA\u201d), which includes markets in Europe as well as Israel, Russia and South Africa.\n Our Rhyz strategic investment arm also includes three additional\n          segments: Manufacturing, Grow Tech, and Rhyz other.

is subject to various laws and regulations globally, particularly with respect to our direct selling business models and our product categories. In addition, as a United States entity\n      operating through subsidiaries in foreign jurisdictions, we are subject to foreign exchange control, transfer pricing and customs laws that regulate the flow of funds between us and our subsidiaries and for product purchases, management services and\n      contractual obligations, such as the payment of sales commissions. As is the case with most companies in our industry, we receive inquiries from time to time from government regulatory authorities regarding the nature of our business and other\n      issues, such as compliance with local direct selling, transfer pricing, customs, taxation, foreign exchange control, securities and other laws.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirect Selling Regulations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirect selling is regulated by various national, state and local government agencies in the United States and foreign markets. These laws and regulations are generally intended to\n        prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes, including \u201cpyramid\u201d schemes, which compensate participants \nprimarily \nfor recruiting additional participants \nwithout significant emphasis on product sales\n      to consumers. \nThe laws and regulations in our current markets generally:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nimpose requirements related to order cancellations, product returns, inventory buy-backs and cooling-off periods for our sales force and consumers;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nrequire us, or our sales force, to register with government agencies;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nimpose limits on the amount of sales compensation we can pay;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nimpose reporting requirements; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nrequire that our sales force is compensated for sales of products and not for recruiting others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe laws and regulations governing direct selling may be modified or reinterpreted from time to time, which may cause us to modify our \nsales \ncompensation and business models.\n      \nIn almost all of our markets, regulations are subject to discretionary interpretation by regulators and judicial authorities. \nThere is often ambiguity and uncertainty with respect to the state of direct\n      selling and anti-pyramiding laws and regulations. In the United States, for example, federal law provides law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), broad latitude in policing unfair or deceptive trade practices, but does\n      not provide a bright-line test for identifying a pyramid scheme. A number of states have passed legislation that more clearly distinguishes between illegal pyramid schemes and legitimate multi-level marketing business models. Recent settlements\n      between the FTC and other direct selling companies and guidance from the FTC have addressed inappropriate earnings and lifestyle claims, problematic compensation structures and the importance of focusing on consumers. In addition, during 2021 the FTC\n      announced that it is initiating a review of its Business Opportunity Rule, which imposes certain obligations on business opportunity sellers in their dealings with prospective buyers. Currently, multi-level marketing companies are exempted from this\n      rule. If this exemption is eliminated or if new regulations are adopted for multi-level marketing companies, it could negatively impact the growth of our sales force and our revenue. Also during 2021, the FTC sent a notice to more than 1,100\n      companies, including us and two of our subsidiaries (Pharmanex, LLC and Big Planet, Inc.), that outlined several practices that the FTC determined to be unfair or deceptive in prior administrative cases. These practices relate to earnings claims,\n      other money-making opportunity claims, and endorsements and testimonials. Pursuant to the FTC\u2019s \u201cpenalty offense authority,\u201d companies that received the notice are expected to comply with the standards set in the prior administrative cases and could\n      incur significant civil penalties if they or their representatives fail to do so. The penalties could be up to $43,792 per violation, and there is some ambiguity in how a \u201cviolation\u201d would be defined for these purposes. For more information about\n      these matters, other regulatory actions, and their potential impact on our business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors\u2014\u201cChallenges to the form of our network marketing system could harm our business\u201d and \u201cLaws and regulations may prohibit or severely\n      restrict direct selling and cause our revenue and profitability to decline, and regulators could adopt new regulations that harm our business.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe regulatory environment in Mainland China is particularly complex and continues to evolve. Mainland China\u2019s direct selling and anti-pyramiding regulations contain various\n        restrictions, including a prohibition on the payment of multi-level compensation. The regulations are subject to discretionary interpretation by state, provincial and local regulators as well as local customs and practices. Regulators continue to\n        act cautiously as they monitor the development of direct selling in Mainland China. To expand our direct selling model into additional provinces in Mainland China, we currently must obtain a series of approvals from the local Department of Commerce\n        in such provinces, the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Commerce (our supervisory authority), as well as the Ministry of Commerce, PRC (\u201cMOFCOM\u201d), which is the national governmental authority overseeing direct selling. In the course of obtaining\n        these approvals, the respective authorities under MOFCOM must also consult and seek opinions on our business operations from the Ministry of Public Security and the Administration for Market Regulation at both provincial and state levels. \nGovernment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      authorities have not been issuing new licenses for direct selling since the beginning of the 100-day action in early 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur operations in Mainland China are subject to significant government and media scrutiny and investigations. At times, investigations and other regulatory actions have limited our ability to conduct business in\n      Mainland China. For example, the government\u2019s scrutiny of activities within the health products and direct selling industries has been at higher levels since 2019, following negative media coverage about the healthcare-related product claims made by\n      another direct selling company in Mainland China. During this time, we have been receiving and addressing an increased number of government reviews, inspections, and inquiries and consumer complaints in Mainland China; our ability to hold certain\n      business meetings has been limited; and negative media coverage has spread to include additional companies, including ours. Another example occurred in 2014. In response to media and government scrutiny of our Mainland China business in 2014, we\n      voluntarily took a number of actions in Mainland China, including temporarily suspending our business meetings, temporarily suspending acceptance of applications for any new sales representatives, and extending our product refund and return policies.\n      These voluntary measures and the adverse publicity had a significant negative impact on our business. We face a risk that future investigations and other regulatory actions may result in fines, revocation of licenses or other significant sanctions.\n      For more information about these matters, other regulatory actions, and their potential impact on our business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, \u201cRisks Associated with Our Operations in Mainland China.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral markets, including Mainland China, South Korea, Indonesia and Vietnam, impose limits on the amount of sales compensation we can pay to our sales force. For example, under regulations in Mainland China, direct\n      selling companies may pay independent direct sellers in Mainland China up to a maximum 30% of the revenue they generate through their own sales of products to consumers. Additionally, in South Korea, local regulations limit sales compensation to 35%\n      of our total value of goods or services supplied in South Korea. We have implemented various measures to comply with these limits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some markets, regulations applicable to the activities of our Sales Leaders may affect our business because we are, or regulators may assert that we are, responsible for our Sales Leaders\u2019 conduct. In these markets,\n      regulators may request or require that we take steps to ensure that our Sales Leaders comply with local regulations. For example, in Japan, we have taken steps to comply with strict requirements regarding how Brand Affiliates approach prospective\n      customers. From time to time, we receive information from consumer centers in certain prefectures about the number of general inquiries and complaints about us and our Brand Affiliates, and we also sometimes receive warnings to reduce such\n      complaints. Based on this information, we continually evaluate and enhance our Brand Affiliate compliance, education and training efforts in Japan.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nOur sales force is required to comply with work authorization and other local legal requirements prior to working in a market. Some markets, including Mainland China and Vietnam, also prohibit or restrict participation\n      of overseas personnel or foreigners in direct selling activities. We have implemented policies that are designed to comply with these regulations and inform our sales force regarding the types of activities that are not permitted. However, we cannot\n      assure that actions of our sales force will not violate local laws or regulations or our policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for more information on regulatory and other risks associated with our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Regulations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur beauty and wellness products and related promotional and marketing activities are subject to extensive government regulation by numerous federal, state and local government agencies and\n      authorities, including the United States Food and Drug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d), the FTC, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Department of Agriculture, United States and State Attorneys General and other state regulatory agencies in the\n      United States, as well as the State Administration for Market Regulation in Mainland China, the Food and Drug Administration in Taiwan, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety in South Korea, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan and\n      similar government agencies in all other markets in which we operate. In the United States, the FDA, in particular, regulates the formulation, manufacture and labeling of over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) drugs, cosmetics, dietary supplements, foods and\n      medical devices such as those distributed by us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulation of Beauty Products in the United States.\n Our beauty products are subject to various laws and regulations that regulate\n      cosmetic and personal care products and set forth regulations that, among other things, determine whether a product can be marketed as a \u201ccosmetic\u201d or requires further approval as an OTC drug. In the United States, the regulation of cosmetic content\n      and labeling is under the primary jurisdiction of the FDA. Cosmetics are not subject to pre-market approval by the FDA, but their ingredients and their label and labeling content are regulated by the FDA, and it is the burden of those who sell\n      cosmetics to ensure that they are safe for use as directed and not adulterated or misbranded. The labeling of cosmetic products is subject to the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFDCA\u201d), the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act\n      and other FDA regulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FDCA defines cosmetics by their intended use, as \u201carticles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body . . . for cleansing,\n      beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance.\u201d Among the products included in this definition are skin moisturizers, perfumes, lipsticks, fingernail polishes, eye and facial makeup preparations, shampoos, permanent waves, hair\n      colors, toothpastes and deodorants, as well as material intended for use as a component of a cosmetic product. A product may be considered a drug if it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or is\n      intended to affect the structure or any function of the body (\u201cstructure/function claims\u201d). A product\u2019s intended use can be inferred from marketing or product claims, and regulators may consider the marketing claims of our sales force.\n      Structure/function claims are generally prohibited for cosmetic products as are disease prevention and treatment claims. The FDA prohibits certain ingredients from being included in cosmetic products. It is possible that cosmetic product ingredients\n      now commonly in use that are the product of certain scientific advancements or production processes may be restricted or prohibited in the future as more is learned about such ingredients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years, the FDA has issued warning letters to many cosmetic companies alleging improper structure/function claims regarding their cosmetic products, including, for example, product claims\n      regarding gene activity, cellular rejuvenation, and rebuilding collagen. Cosmetic companies confront difficulty in determining whether a claim would be considered by the FDA to be an improper structure/function claim. Given this difficulty, and our\n      research and product development focus on the sources of aging and the influence of certain ingredients on gene expression, there is a risk that we could receive a warning letter, be required to modify our product claims or take other actions to\n      satisfy the FDA if the FDA determines any of our marketing materials contain improper structure/function claims for our cosmetic products. In addition, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers have filed class action lawsuits against some of our competitors after our\n      competitors received these FDA warning letters. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to government actions or lawsuits, which could harm our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCertain products, such as sunscreens and acne treatments, are classified as OTC drugs (and cosmetics, depending on claims) and have specific ingredient, labeling and manufacturing requirements. OTC\n      drug products may be marketed if they conform to the requirements of an FDA-established OTC drug monograph that is applicable to that drug. Drug products not conforming to monograph requirements require an approved New Drug Application (\u201cNDA\u201d) before\n      marketing may begin. Under these provisions, if the agency were to find that a product or ingredient of one of our OTC drug products is not generally recognized as safe and effective or is not included in a final monograph that is applicable to one\n      of our OTC drug products, we may be required to reformulate or cease marketing that product until it is the subject of an approved NDA or until the time, if ever, that the monograph is amended to include such product. The labeling of these products\n      is subject to the requirements of the FDCA and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act and other FDA regulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulation of Beauty Products in Other Markets. \nThe other markets in which we operate have similar regulations. In Mainland China,\n      beauty products, other than devices, are placed into one of two categories, \u201cspecial-purpose cosmetics\u201d and \u201cgeneral cosmetics.\u201d Products in both categories require adequate substantiation of efficacy, which must be made available to authorities\n      prior to marketing a product and which can be reviewed and enforced upon at any time thereafter. The product registration process for some categories of beauty products in Mainland China can be unpredictable and generally takes from 9 to 18 months to\n      complete. However, in some cases, product registration in Mainland China has taken several years. In Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare regulates the sale and distribution of cosmetics and requires us to have an import business license\n      and to register each beauty product imported into Japan. In Taiwan, all \u201cmedicated\u201d cosmetic products require registration. In South Korea, all \u201cfunctional\u201d cosmetics are required to either undergo examination by or be reported to the Ministry of\n      Food and Drug Safety. The sale of cosmetic products is regulated in the European Union (the \u201cEU\u201d) under the EU Cosmetics Directive, which requires a uniform application for foreign companies making beauty product sales. Similar regulations in any of\n      our markets may limit our ability to import products or utilize key ingredients or technologies globally and may delay product launches while the registration and approval process is pending. Changing regulations may require us to stop selling,\n      discontinue or reformulate and re-register products in order to sell those products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulation of Wellness Products in the United States. \nOur wellness products are also subject to applicable regulations of government\n      agencies in the markets in which we operate. In the United States, we generally market our wellness products as conventional foods or dietary supplements. The FDA has jurisdiction over this regulatory area. The FDA imposes specific requirements for\n      the labels and labeling of food and dietary supplements, including the requirements of the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004, which mandates declaration of the presence of major food allergens. In addition, the Public Health\n      Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 contains requirements with regard to the sale and importation of food products in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (\u201cFSMA\u201d), which was signed into law in 2011, also increased the FDA\u2019s authority with respect to food safety and made significant changes to the\n        FDCA with respect to strengthening the U.S. food safety system. It enables the FDA to focus more on preventing food safety problems rather than primarily reacting to problems after they occur. The law also provides the FDA with enforcement\n        authorities designed to achieve higher rates of compliance with prevention- and risk-based food safety standards and to better respond to and contain problems when they do occur. The law also gives the FDA important tools to hold imported foods to\n        the same standards as domestic foods and directs the FDA to build an integrated national food safety system in partnership with state and local authorities. The\n\u00a0\nFDA is actively enforcing FSMA requirements,\n        subjecting food and nutritional supplements to increased regulatory scrutiny. Pursuant to FSMA, the FDA is authorized, among other things, to order mandatory recalls, issue \u201cadministrative detention\u201d orders, and revoke manufacturing facility\n        registrations (effectively preventing the operation of a food or dietary supplement manufacturing facility), and importers of foods and nutritional supplements are subject to Foreign Supplier Verification Program requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FDA regulates dietary supplements principally under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (\u201cDSHEA\u201d). DSHEA formally defines what may be sold as a dietary supplement, defines\n      statements of nutritional support and the conditions under which they may lawfully be used, and includes provisions that permit the FDA to regulate manufacturing practices and labeling claims applicable to dietary supplements. Because the majority of\n      our wellness products are regulated under DSHEA, we are generally not required to obtain regulatory approval prior to introducing a dietary supplement into the United States market. Prior to marketing a product, we are obligated to notify the FDA of\n      any structure/function claims that we intend to make about the product in any product-related materials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerally, under DSHEA, dietary ingredients that were on the market before October 15, 1994 may be used in dietary supplements without notifying the FDA. However, a \u201cnew\u201d dietary ingredient (i.e.,\n      a dietary ingredient that was not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994) must be the subject of a new dietary ingredient notification submitted to the FDA unless the ingredient has been \u201cpresent in the food supply as an article used\n      for food\u201d without having been \u201cchemically altered.\u201d The enforcement of the term \u201cchemically altered\u201d has been and continues to evolve within the FDA. As such, an ingredient that is deemed today not to be \u201cchemically altered\u201d may be viewed otherwise\n      in the future, which could lead to our being required to reformulate or cease marketing the product until such time that we can find a suitable replacement. A new dietary ingredient notification must provide the FDA with evidence of a \u201chistory of use\n      or other evidence of safety\u201d which establishes that use of the dietary ingredient \u201cwill reasonably be expected to be safe.\u201d A new dietary ingredient notification must be submitted to the FDA at least 75 days before the new dietary ingredient can be\n      marketed. Under DSHEA, the FDA may seek to remove from the market any new dietary ingredient that the FDA determines to be unsafe. In addition, the FDA may also deem a dietary supplement an unapproved drug where the marketing claims made in\n      connection with the sale or promotion of the product effectively place it in the drug category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulation of Wellness Products Globally.\n In our foreign markets, nutritional supplements are generally regulated by similar government\n      agencies, such as the Mainland China State Administration for Market Regulation, the South Korea Ministry of Food and Drug Safety; the Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare and the Taiwan Department of Health. We typically market our wellness\n      products in international markets as foods, health foods, dietary supplements, food supplements or other similar categorizations under applicable regulatory regimes. With few exceptions, in the event a product or ingredient is classified as a drug or\n      pharmaceutical product in any market, we will generally not be able to distribute that product in that market through our distribution channel because of pre-market approvals and strict regulations applicable to drug and pharmaceutical products.\n      Mainland China also has highly restrictive nutritional supplement product regulations. Products marketed as \u201chealth foods\u201d are subject to extensive laboratory and clinical analysis by government authorities, and the product registration process in\n      Mainland China takes a minimum of two years and may be substantially longer. In some cases it has taken us four years or longer to obtain product registrations. A pre-market process has been established for \u201chealth foods,\u201d which allows products with\n      only basic nutritional ingredients (some vitamins and minerals) to be notified rather than registered. We market both \u201chealth foods\u201d and \u201cgeneral foods\u201d in Mainland China. There is some risk associated with the common practice in Mainland China of\n      marketing a product as a \u201cgeneral food\u201d while seeking \u201chealth food\u201d classification. If government officials feel the categorization of our products is inconsistent with product claims, form of delivery, ingredients or function, this could end or\n      limit our ability to market such products in Mainland China in their current form. In addition, we are not permitted to market or sell \u201cgeneral foods\u201d through our direct sales channel in Mainland China and any efforts by our independent direct\n      sellers to do so could result in negative publicity, fines and other government sanctions being imposed against us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe markets in which we operate all have varied regulations that distinguish foods and nutritional supplements from \u201cpharmaceutical products.\u201d Because of the varied regulations, some products or\n      ingredients that are recognized as a \u201cfood\u201d in certain markets may be treated as a \u201cpharmaceutical\u201d in other markets. In Japan, for example, if a specified ingredient is not listed as a \u201cfood\u201d by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, we must either\n      modify the product to eliminate or substitute that ingredient, or petition the government to treat such ingredient as a food. We experience similar issues in our other markets. This is particularly a challenge in Europe, where regulations often still\n      differ from member state to member state, despite EU regulations designed to harmonize the laws of EU member states. As a result, we often must modify the ingredients and/or the levels of ingredients in our products for certain markets or create\n      unique formulations for multiple markets. In some circumstances, the regulations in foreign markets may require us to obtain regulatory approval prior to introduction of a new product or limit our use of certain ingredients altogether.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause of negative publicity associated with some adulterated or misbranded supplements, including pharmaceutical drugs marketed as dietary supplements, there has been an increased movement in the\n      United States and other markets to expand the regulation of dietary supplements, which could lead to additional restrictions or requirements in the future. In general, the regulatory environment is becoming more complex with increasingly stricter\n      regulations each year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManufacturing Process.\n In 2008, and as subsequently updated under the regulations implementing the FSMA, the FDA established\n        regulations to require current \u201cgood manufacturing practices\u201d for dietary supplements and food products in the United States. The regulations ensure that dietary supplements and food products are produced in a quality manner, do not contain\n        contaminants or impurities above pre-established levels, and are accurately labeled. The regulations include requirements for establishing quality control procedures for us and our vendors and suppliers, designing and constructing manufacturing\n        plants, and testing ingredients and finished products throughout our supply chain. The regulations also include requirements for record keeping and handling consumer product complaints. If dietary supplements or food products contain contaminants\n        or allergens or do not contain the type or quantity of dietary ingredient they are represented to contain, the FDA would consider those products to be adulterated or misbranded. Our business is subject to additional FDA regulations, such as new\n        dietary ingredient regulations and adverse event reporting regulations that require us to document and track adverse events and report serious adverse events that involve hospitalization, permanent impairment or death associated with consumers\u2019 use\n        of certain of our products. Compliance with these regulations has increased, and may further increase, the cost of manufacturing and selling certain of our products as we incur internal costs, oversee and inspect more aspects of third-party\n        manufacturing and work with our vendors to assure they are in compliance and maintain accurate recordkeeping to establish controls. Failure to comply with good manufacturing practices could also result in product recalls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertising and Product Claims.\n Most of our major markets also regulate advertising and product claims regarding the efficacy and quality\n      of products and require adequate and reliable scientific substantiation of all claims. In most of our foreign markets, we are typically not able to make any \u201cmedicinal\u201d claims with respect to our wellness products. In some cases, such regulations may\n      limit our ability to inform consumers of some of the benefits our products offer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the United States, the FDA generally prohibits disease diagnosis, prevention and treatment claims when made for a dietary supplement. DSHEA, however, permits substantiated,\n        truthful and non-misleading \u201cstatements of nutritional support\u201d to be included in labeling for dietary supplements without FDA pre-approval.\n Such statements may describe how a particular dietary ingredient affects the structure, function or\n      general well-being of the body, or the mechanism of action by which a dietary ingredient may affect the structure, function or well-being of the body, but such statements may not state that a dietary supplement will reduce the risk or incidence of a\n      disease unless such claim has been reviewed and approved by the FDA. In addition, the FDA permits companies to use FDA-approved full and qualified health claims for products containing specific ingredients that meet stated requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA company that uses a statement of nutritional support in labeling must possess evidence substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading. The FDA has issued guidance defining a manufacturer\u2019s\n      obligations to substantiate structure/function claims. Such statements, when used in labeling, must also be submitted to the FDA no later than thirty days after first marketing the product with the statement that they possess the necessary evidence\n      and must be accompanied by an FDA mandated label disclaimer that \u201cThis statement has not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.\u201d There can be no assurance, however, that the FDA or FTC\n      will not determine that a particular statement of nutritional support that we want to use is an unacceptable disease claim or an unauthorized nutrient-disease relationship claim otherwise permitted with FDA approval as a \u201chealth claim\u201d or that such\n      claims have competent and reliable scientific evidence. Such a determination might prevent the use of such a claim or result in additional FDA enforcement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are aware of media reports regarding dietary supplements, which call for the repeal or amendment of DSHEA. Individuals or groups that are opposed to supplements or question their safety or efficacy may attempt to\n      use these media reports to propose legislation intended to amend or repeal DSHEA. Some of the legislative proposals may include variations on premarket approval, enhanced premarket safety or substantiation required and changing the definition of a\n      \u201cdietary ingredient\u201d to remove either botanicals or selected classes of ingredients now treated as dietary ingredients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the other markets in which we operate have not adopted legislation like DSHEA, and we may be subject to more restrictive limitations on the claims we can make about our products in these\n      markets. For example, in Japan, our nutritional supplements are marketed as food products, which significantly limits our ability to make claims regarding these products. If marketing materials produced or used by us or our sales force globally make\n      claims that exceed the scope of allowed claims for nutritional supplements, the FDA or other regulatory authorities could deem our products to be unapproved drugs. In Mainland China, we also face significant restrictions on our ability to make\n      product claims regarding the efficacy of our products. Violations, alleged violations, or negative media attention related to our compliance with these restrictions could harm consumers\u2019 perception of our business and products and could negatively\n      impact the registration, licensing status and sales of our products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FTC, which exercises primary jurisdiction over the advertising of all of our products in the United States, has instituted enforcement actions against dietary supplement, food, and cosmetic\n      companies for, among other things, deceptive advertising and lack of adequate scientific substantiation for claims. We also face limitations on our use of the scientific experts who have helped us develop and test some of our products. In the United\n      States, for example, the FTC\u2019s Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising may restrict marketing to those results obtained by a \u201ctypical\u201d consumer and require disclosure of any material connections between an endorser\n      and the company or products they are endorsing. In Mainland China, some media outlets have questioned the nature and extent of our connections with our Scientific Advisory Board and others who have helped in developing our scientific approach or\n      testing our products. This negative publicity could harm consumers\u2019 perception of our business and our products, which could negatively impact our revenue. We cannot be sure that the FTC, or comparable foreign agencies, will not question our\n      advertising or other operations in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years, the FTC has initiated numerous investigations of and actions against companies that sell dietary supplements and cosmetic products. The FTC may enforce compliance\n        with the law in a variety of ways, both administratively and judicially, using compulsory process, cease and desist orders, and injunctions. FTC enforcement can result in consent decrees or orders requiring, among other things, injunctive\n        provisions, corrective advertising, consumer redress, and such other relief as the agency deems necessary to protect the public. Violation of these consent decrees or orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties. The FTC also\n        sends warning letters as it monitors companies\u2019 activities. For example, \nduring 2020 and 2021 the FTC issued letters that warned several direct-selling companies to remove and address claims that they or members of their sales force were\n      making about their products\u2019 ability to treat or prevent COVID-19 and/or about the earnings that people who have recently lost income could make. \nNo assurance can be given that the FTC will not question our\n        advertising or other operations in the United States in the future. Any action in the future by the FTC could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn connection with investigations that occurred in the early 1990s of certain alleged unsubstantiated product and earnings claims made by our Brand Affiliates, we entered into a\n        consent decree with the FTC and various agreements with state regulatory agencies. The consent decree requires us to, among other things, supplement our procedures to enforce our policies, not allow our Brand Affiliates to make earnings\n        representations without making certain average earnings disclosures and not allow our Brand Affiliates to make unsubstantiated product claims.\n\u00a0\nThe FTC could initiate an enforcement action to the extent the\n        FTC determines that our advertising or promotional practices are deceptive or contrary to the requirements of the consent decree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulation of Medical Devices.\n In 2014, our facial spa was cleared for marketing through the 510(k) process with the FDA as a medical\n      device with cosmetic benefit. Medical devices are highly regulated by the FDA. Manufacturers of medical devices must register and list their products with the FDA annually, whether they are located domestically or overseas. Foreign jurisdictions may\n      take note of the fact that we have registered a medical device in the United States and require us to register in their market as well. The FDA has broad regulatory powers in the areas of clinical testing, manufacturing and labeling of medical\n      devices. Medical devices must be labeled in accordance with the FDA\u2019s general device labeling requirements and whatever particular label requirements the FDA may designate for that type of device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, medical device manufacturers must adhere to certain \u201cgood manufacturing practices\u201d in accordance with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, which regulates the manufacture of medical\n      devices, prescribes record-keeping procedures and provides for the routine inspection of facilities for compliance with such regulations. If in connection with these inspections, the FDA believes the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable\n      regulations and/or procedures, it may issue observations that would necessitate prompt corrective action. If the FDA inspection observations are not addressed and/or corrective action taken in a timely manner and to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction, the FDA\n      may issue a warning letter (which would similarly necessitate prompt corrective action) and/or proceed directly to other forms of enforcement action. Failure to respond timely to FDA inspection observations, a warning letter or other notice of\n      noncompliance and to promptly come into compliance could result in the FDA bringing enforcement action against us, which could include the shutdown of our production facilities, denial of importation rights to the United States for products\n      manufactured in overseas locations and criminal and civil fines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur \nPharmanex BioPhotonic Scanner\n, \nageLOC LumiSpa\n, \nageLOC Boost\n, \nageLOC Spa\n systems and any future devices\n\u00a0\nmay be subject to the regulations of various health, consumer-protection and other government authorities around the world. These\n      regulations vary from market to market and affect whether our products are required to be registered as medical devices, the claims that can be made with respect to these products, who can use them, and where they can be used. We have been required\n      to register our \nageLOC Spa\n systems\n\u00a0\nas medical devices in a few markets. We have registered \nageLOC Boost\n as a medical device\n      in Thailand, and we intend to do so in the United States as well. We have been subject to regulatory inquiries in the United States, Japan and other markets with respect to the status of the \nPharmanex BioPhotonic\n        Scanner\n as a non-medical device. Any determination that medical device clearance is required for one of our products, in a market where we currently market and sell such product as a cosmetic or non-medical device, could require us to expend\n      significant time and resources in order to meet the additional stringent standards imposed on medical device companies or prevent us from marketing the product.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder applicable direct selling regulations in Mainland China, our \nPharmanex BioPhotonic Scanner\n, \nageLOC LumiSpa\n and \nageLOC Spa\n systems are registered as \u201chealth care equipment\u201d or \u201chousehold appliances,\u201d which enables us to market and sell them through our direct sales channel in that market. The process for registering products for the direct\n        sales channel in Mainland China is subject to delays. However, this process and registration requirement do not apply to all of our sales channels in Mainland China; although our independent direct sellers are prohibited from earning commissions by\n        selling products that are not so registered, sales by our sales employees or independent marketers are not subject to this requirement. Please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors f\nor more information on the regulatory risks associated with our\n      device products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPETITION\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe markets for our products are highly competitive. Our competitors include a broad array of marketers of beauty and wellness products and pharmaceutical companies, such as L\u2019Or\u00e9al, Clinique,\n      Est\u00e9e Lauder, Nature\u2019s Way, Avon Products and Mary Kay, many of which have longer operating histories and greater name recognition and financial resources than we do. We compete in these markets by emphasizing the innovation, value and premium\n      quality of our products and the reach, convenience and customer servicing of our distribution system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirect Selling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe compete with other direct selling organizations, some of which have a longer operating history, and greater visibility, name recognition and financial resources than we do. Leading global direct\n      selling companies include Amway, Natura Cosmeticos and Herbalife. We also compete with local direct selling companies in the markets in which we operate. We compete with these companies to attract and retain our sales force and consumers based on the\n      strength of our product offerings, sales compensation, multiple business opportunities, management and international operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 4,600 full- and part-time employees worldwide. This does not include approximately 15,000 sales employees in our Mainland China operations. Although we\n      have statutory employee representation obligations in certain markets, our employees are generally not represented by labor unions except where expressly required by law. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good, and we do not\n      foresee a shortage in qualified personnel necessary to operate our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of our full- and part-time employees are responsible for upholding the Nu Skin Code of Conduct and for striving to perpetuate the Nu Skin Way, our global culture aspiration, which includes the\n      following principles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nA force for good\n\n\n\u25cf\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAccountable and empowered\n\n\n\u25cf\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBold innovators\n\n\n\u25cf\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nCustomer obsessed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDirect and decisive\n\n\n\u25cf\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nExceptional\n\n\n\u25cf\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFast speed\n\n\n\u25cf\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nOne global team\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nu Skin Way forms the foundation of our human capital strategy and objectives. The three primary objectives of our human capital strategy are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\n\n\n\n\nSupport the transformation of our business and culture to align with our business strategies and the Nu Skin Way;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\n\n\n\nLeverage global diversity and build inclusion; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\n\n\n\nSimplify the employee experience through global alignment and optimization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo measure our progress in achieving these objectives, we conduct a global employee survey every four months, which also gathers employee feedback for purposes of designing our talent programs,\n      rewards and benefits. Averaging an approximately 86% response rate during 2021, this survey generates valuable information for us to analyze and to act upon when appropriate. Each survey cycle yielded more than 70,000 data points, consisting of\n      employee responses to each survey question and employee comments. We also conducted focus groups with our employees to gather their feedback on the employee experience, including diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) matters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe regularly review our employees\u2019 feedback to better align our human capital initiatives to the needs of our employees. For example, employee feedback has helped guide improvements in diversity,\n      equity and inclusion; manager development; and employee wellness efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Board\u2019s committees engage with our senior management and head of Human Resources regarding human capital management on a regular basis. Working with management, our Board\u2019s committees oversee\n      and receive reports on matters including culture, compensation, benefits, key talent succession planning, employee engagement, and DEI. Each year, our management also reports to the Compensation and Human Capital Committee on management\u2019s annual\n      assessment of risks related to our compensation policies and practices. In addition, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee conducts annual performance reviews for our key executive officers, and these performance reviews include their\n      performance on human capital management initiatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvidencing the success of our human capital management initiatives, in 2021 we were recognized by the \nDirect Selling News\n as one of the best places to work in direct selling, the sixth consecutive year we have received this honor. In addition, \nForbes\n\n        magazine named us to its list of the World\u2019s Top Female-Friendly Companies for 2021 and to the \nForbes \nlist of America\u2019s Best Employers for 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to our employees, our human capital resources also include our sales force.

Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed by any of these risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to\n      any of these risks, which should be considered together with the other items in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Item 1. Business and Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisks Associated with Direct Selling and Our Sales Force\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenges to the form of our network marketing system could harm our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe may be subject to challenges by government regulators regarding the form of our network marketing system. Legal and regulatory requirements concerning the direct selling industry generally do not include \u201cbright\n      line\u201d rules and are inherently fact-based and subject to interpretation. As a result, regulators and courts have discretion in their application of these laws and regulations, and the enforcement or interpretation of these laws and regulations by\n      government agencies or courts can change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent settlements between the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) and other direct selling companies and guidance from the FTC have addressed inappropriate earnings and lifestyle claims, problematic compensation\n      structures and the importance of focusing on consumers. These developments have created ambiguity as to the proper interpretation of the law and related court decisions. The FTC has been active in its enforcement activities, and any adverse rulings\n      or legal actions could impact our business if direct selling laws or anti-pyramid laws are interpreted more narrowly or in a manner that results in additional burdens or restrictions on direct selling companies. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nIn 2015, the FTC took aggressive actions against a multi-level marketing company, alleging an illegal business model and inappropriate earnings claims.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nIn 2016, the FTC entered into a settlement with a multi-level marketing company, requiring the company to modify its business model, including basing sales compensation and qualification only on sales to retail and preferred customers\n                and on purchases by a distributor for personal consumption within allowable limits. Although this settlement does not represent judicial precedent or a new FTC rule, the FTC has indicated that the industry should look at this settlement,\n                and the principles underlying its specific measures, for guidance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nIn 2019, the FTC entered into a settlement with a multi-level marketing company, alleging an illegal business model and compensation structure and inappropriate earnings claims. The company agreed to a prohibition from engaging in\n                multi-level marketing. The FTC and another multi-level marketing company are currently in litigation, and that company had indicated the FTC was seeking to limit the levels of payment in its compensation structure as a condition to\n                settlement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nDuring 2020 and 2021, the FTC issued letters that warned several direct-selling companies to remove and address claims that they or members of their sales force were making about their products\u2019 ability to treat or prevent COVID-19\n                and/or about the earnings that people who have recently lost income could make.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, the FTC sent a notice to more than 1,100 companies, including us and two of our subsidiaries (Pharmanex, LLC and Big Planet, Inc.), that outlined several practices that the FTC determined to be unfair or deceptive in prior\n                administrative cases. These practices relate to earnings claims, other money-making opportunity claims, and endorsements and testimonials. Pursuant to the FTC\u2019s \u201cpenalty offense authority,\u201d companies that received the notice are expected to\n                comply with the standards set in the prior administrative cases and could incur significant civil penalties if they or their representatives fail to do so. The penalties could be up to $43,792 per violation, and there is some ambiguity in\n                how a \u201cviolation\u201d would be defined for these purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough we take steps to educate our Brand Affiliates on proper claims, if our Brand Affiliates make improper claims, or if regulators determine we are making any improper claims, this could lead to an FTC\n      investigation and could harm our business. In addition, if the requirements related to compensation structures in the actions listed above lead to new industry standards or new rules, or if they limit the levels in the network for which payments can\n      be made, our business could be impacted and we may need to amend our global sales compensation plan. With a majority of our revenue in the United States coming from sales to retail customers and preferred customers, we believe that we can demonstrate\n      consumer demand for our products, but we continue to monitor developments to assess whether we should make any changes to our business or global sales compensation plan. If we are required to make changes or if the FTC seeks to enforce similar\n      measures in the industry, either through rulemaking or an enforcement action against our company, our business could be harmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could also be subject to challenges by private parties in civil actions. We are aware of civil actions against other direct-selling companies in the United States, that have, and may in the future, resulted in\n      significant settlements. Allegations directed at us and our competitors regarding the legality of multi-level marketing in various markets and adverse media reports have also created intense public scrutiny of us and our industry. Our business has\n      also been subject to formal and informal inquiries from various government regulatory authorities in the past regarding our business and our compliance with local laws and regulations. All of these actions and any future scrutiny of us or our\n      industry could generate negative publicity or further regulatory actions that could result in fines, restrict our ability to conduct our business in our various markets, enter into new markets, motivate our sales force and attract consumers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaws and regulations may prohibit or severely restrict direct selling and cause our revenue and profitability to decline, and regulators could adopt new regulations that harm our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious government agencies throughout the world regulate direct sales practices. Laws and regulations in the United States, Japan, South Korea and Mainland China are particularly stringent and subject to broad\n      discretion in enforcement by regulators. These laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes, often referred to as \u201cpyramid schemes,\u201d that compensate participants primarily for recruiting additional\n      participants without significant emphasis on product sales to consumers. The laws and regulations in our current markets often:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nimpose requirements related to sign-up, order cancellations, product returns, inventory buy-backs and cooling-off periods for our sales force and consumers;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nrequire us, or our sales force, to register with government agencies;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nimpose limits on the amount of sales compensation we can pay;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nimpose reporting requirements; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nrequire that\n our sales force is compensated for selling products and not for recruiting others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplying with these widely varying and sometimes inconsistent rules and regulations can be difficult, time-consuming and expensive, and requires significant resources. The laws and regulations governing direct selling\n      are modified from time to time, and like other direct selling companies, we are subject from time to time to government inquiries and investigations in our various markets related to our direct selling activities. This can require us to make changes\n      to our business model and aspects of our sales compensation plan in the markets impacted by such changes and investigations. During 2021, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) announced that it is initiating a review of its Business Opportunity\n      Rule, which imposes certain obligations on business opportunity sellers in their dealings with prospective buyers. Currently, multi-level marketing companies are exempted from this rule. If this exemption is eliminated or if new regulations are\n      adopted for multi-level marketing companies, it could negatively impact the growth of our sales force and our revenue. In addition, markets where we currently do business could change their laws or regulations to prohibit direct selling. If we are\n      unable to obtain necessary licenses and certifications within required deadlines or continue business in existing markets or commence operations in new markets because of these laws, our revenue and profitability may decline. Any delay could\n      negatively impact our revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproper sales force actions could harm our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSales force activities that violate applicable laws, regulations or policies, or that are alleged to do so, have, and could in the future, harmed our business and reputation and resulted in government or third-party\n      actions against us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, in 2014, allegations were made by various media outlets that certain of our sales representatives in Mainland China failed to adequately follow and enforce our policies and regulations. This adverse\n      publicity, as well as a government review and actions that we voluntarily took to address the situation, resulted in a significant negative impact on our revenue and the number of Sales Leaders and Customers in the region. Similar or more extreme\n      actions by government agencies in Mainland China or other markets in the future could have a significant adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe direct selling industry in Japan continues to experience regulatory and media scrutiny, and other direct selling companies have been suspended from sponsoring activities. Japan imposes strict requirements regarding\n      how Brand Affiliates approach prospective customers. From time to time, we receive information from consumer centers in certain prefectures about the number of general inquiries and complaints about us and our Brand Affiliates, and we also sometimes\n      receive warnings to reduce such complaints. Based on this information, we continually evaluate and enhance our Brand Affiliate compliance, education and training efforts in Japan. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts will successfully\n      prevent regulatory actions against us, including fines, suspensions or other sanctions, or that the company and the direct selling industry will not receive further negative media attention, all of which could harm our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcept in Mainland China, members of our sales force are not employees and act independently of us. The most significant area of risk for such activities relates to improper product claims and claims regarding the\n      business opportunity of joining our sales force. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nDuring 2020 and 2021, the FTC issued letters that warned several direct-selling companies to remove and address claims that they or members of their sales force \nwere\n making about their products\u2019\n                ability to treat or prevent COVID-19 and/or about the earnings that people who have recently lost income could make.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, the FTC sent a notice to more than 1,100 companies, including us and two of our subsidiaries (Pharmanex, LLC and Big Planet, Inc.), that outlined several practices that the FTC determined to be unfair or deceptive in prior\n                administrative cases. These practices relate to earnings claims, other money-making opportunity claims, and endorsements and testimonials. Pursuant to the FTC\u2019s \u201cpenalty offense authority,\u201d companies that received the notice are \nexpected\n to comply with the standards set in the prior administrative cases and could incur significant civil penalties if they or their representatives fail to do so. The penalties could be up to\n                $43,792 per violation, and there is some ambiguity in how a \u201cviolation\u201d would be defined for these purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe implement strict policies and procedures to ensure our sales force complies with legal requirements. However, given the size of our sales force, we experience problems from time to time. For example, product claims\n      made by some of our sales force in 1990 and 1991 led to a FTC investigation that resulted in our entering into a consent agreement with the FTC and various agreements with state regulatory agencies. In addition, rulings by the South Korean Fair Trade\n      Commission and by judicial authorities against us and other companies in South Korea indicate that, if our sales force engages in criminal activity, we may be held liable or penalized for failure to supervise them adequately. Our sales force may\n      attempt to anticipate which markets we will open in the future and begin marketing and sponsoring activities in markets where we are not qualified to conduct business. We could face fines, suspensions or other legal action if our sales force violates\n      applicable laws and regulations, and our reputation and brand could be negatively impacted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, as our sales force increasingly uses social media to promote our business opportunity and products, this increases the burden on us to monitor compliance of such activities. It also increases the risk that\n      such social media content could contain problematic claims in violation of our policies and applicable regulations. For example, due to the borderless nature of social media, a claim that is allowed in one market may ultimately reach another market\n      where it is not allowed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial media platforms\u2019 decisions to prohibit, block or decrease the prominence of our sales force\u2019s content could harm our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial media platforms have, and could in the future, decided to prohibit, block or decrease the prominence of our sales force\u2019s content for any reason. For example, due to concerns with multi-level marketing, the\n      TikTok and WhatsApp Business platforms have updated their policies to prohibit content related to multi-level marketing. In addition, Pinterest and Facebook prohibit ads that promote multi-level marketing opportunities, and Pinterest has also imposed\n      restrictions on weight loss products, claims and photos. Our business is becoming increasingly dependent on social commerce. Additional social media platforms\u2019 adoption of similar or stricter policies could significantly hamper our sales force\u2019s\n      ability to promote our products and attract consumers, which could cause our revenue to decline. Our reputation could also be harmed if our sales force violates any social media platform\u2019s policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf our business practices or policies or the actions of our sales force are deemed to be in violation of applicable local regulations regarding foreigners, then we could be\n        sanctioned and/or required to change our business model, which could significantly harm our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur sales force is required to comply with work authorization and other local legal requirements prior to working in a market. Some markets, including Mainland China and Vietnam, also prohibit or restrict participation\n      of foreigners in direct selling activities. We have implemented policies that are designed to comply with these regulations and inform our sales force regarding the types of activities that are not permitted. However, we cannot assure that actions of\n      our sales force will not violate local laws or regulations or our policies. If our business practices or policies or the actions of our sales force are deemed to be in violation of applicable regulations as they may be interpreted or enforced, then\n      we could be sanctioned and/or required to change our business model, which could result in adverse publicity and significantly harm our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur sales compensation plans or other incentives could be viewed negatively by some of our sales force, could fail to achieve desired long-term results and have a negative\n        impact on revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur sales compensation includes some components that differ from market to market. We modify components of our sales compensation from time to time to keep our sales compensation plans and business models competitive\n      and attractive to our existing sales force and people interested in joining our sales force, to address changing market dynamics, to provide incentives to our sales force that we believe will help grow our business, to conform to local regulations\n      and to address other business needs. Because of the size of our sales force and the complexity of our sales compensation plans, it is difficult to predict how such changes will be viewed by our sales force and whether such changes will achieve their\n      desired results. It also is difficult to predict how such changes may impact our ability to attract a larger potential target market of opportunity seekers. Certain changes we have made to our global sales compensation plan in the past, which were\n      successful in several markets, did not achieve anticipated results in certain other markets, were not viewed positively by some segments of our sales force, and negatively impacted our business. Similarly, we face the risk that we could fail to make\n      changes to our compensation plans that would be necessary to keep our compensation competitive with the market and allow us to attract new opportunity seekers or segments of opportunity seekers, which could have a negative impact on our sales force.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, we have been required to modify our sales compensation plan in certain markets, including South Korea and Vietnam, from time to time to remain in compliance with applicable sales compensation limits.\n      Changes to reduce sales compensation have had a negative impact on the sales force in the past and could in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have announced that we will be making some changes to our compensation plan in the United States to limit the amount of volume from internal sales to our sales force that can be used in the calculation of their\n      compensation and performance measurements. To facilitate these changes, we are working to implement digital tools to allow our sales force to more easily document resales and also to encourage a shift in behavior through incentives and recognition.\n      To the extent these proposed changes are more difficult to implement and transition than anticipated, our sales force could be distracted or have their commission impacted, all of which could negatively impact our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimits on the amount of sales compensation we pay could inhibit our ability to attract and retain our sales force, negatively impact our revenue and cause regulatory risks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral markets, including Mainland China, South Korea, Indonesia and Vietnam, impose limits on the amount of sales compensation we can pay to our sales force. For example, under regulations in Mainland China, direct\n      selling companies may pay independent direct sellers in Mainland China up to a maximum 30% of the revenue they generate through their own sales of products to consumers. Additionally, in South Korea, local regulations limit sales compensation to 35%\n      of our total value of goods or services supplied in South Korea. These regulations may limit the incentive for people to join our sales force and may reduce our ability to differentiate ourselves from our competitors in attracting and retaining our\n      sales force.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, we have been required to modify our sales compensation plan in certain markets, including South Korea, from time to time to remain in compliance with applicable sales compensation limits. Because sales\n      compensation, as a percentage of revenue, can fluctuate as sales force productivity fluctuates, we may be required to make further changes to stay within applicable sales compensation limits or may be at risk of exceeding them. In addition, which\n      revenues and expenses are within the scope of these regulations is not always clear, and interpretation and enforcement of these laws are subject to change, which could require us to make further changes or result in non-compliance with these\n      regulations. Any failure to keep sales compensation within legal limits in Mainland China, South Korea, Indonesia, Vietnam or any other market that imposes a sales compensation limit could result in fines or other sanctions, including suspensions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe may be held responsible for certain taxes or assessments relating to the activities of our sales force, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are subject to the risk in some jurisdictions of being responsible for social security, withholding or other taxes with respect to payments to our sales force. This would occur if a jurisdiction classifies our sales\n      force as our employees rather than as independent contractors, or if a jurisdiction expands the categories of personnel to whom these tax obligations apply. Some jurisdictions have begun taking these positions with respect to the distributors of\n      direct selling companies, and they may continue to do so. For example, some jurisdictions have, without challenging the \u201cindependent contractor\u201d status, taken the position that direct sellers must nonetheless pay certain taxes with respect to\n      payments to their sales force.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, authorities in some jurisdictions have challenged the \u201cindependent contractor\u201d status of distributors of some multi-level marketing companies. In the event that local laws and regulations, or the\n      interpretation of local laws and regulations, change to require us to treat members of our sales force as employees rather than independent contractors, or that our Brand Affiliates are deemed by local regulatory authorities in one or more of the\n      jurisdictions in which we operate to be our employees rather than independent contractors under existing laws and interpretations, we may be held responsible for a variety of obligations that are imposed upon employers relating to their employees,\n      including social security, withholding and related taxes, minimum wage laws, and any related assessments and penalties, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. This risk increases as our sales force increases its use of social\n      sharing, as several jurisdictions\u2019 regulations protect in-person or in-home sales demonstrations from creating an employment relationship but are less protective of online demonstrations. If our Brand Affiliates were deemed to be employees rather\n      than independent contractors, we would also face the risk of increased liability for their actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisks Associated with Our Operations in Mainland China\n\n\nOur operations in Mainland China are subject to significant government scrutiny, and we could be subject to fines or other penalties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur operations in Mainland China are subject to significant regulatory scrutiny. The legal system in Mainland China provides government authorities broad latitude to conduct investigations, and many Chinese\n      regulations, including those governing our business, are subject to significant interpretation, which may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Because of significant government concerns in Mainland China regarding improper direct selling\n      activities, government regulators closely scrutinize activities of direct selling companies and activities that resemble direct selling. The government in Mainland China continues to inspect and review companies in the direct selling industry on a\n      regular basis, which has and may continue to increase regulatory scrutiny of the industry and our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government\u2019s scrutiny of activities within the health products and direct selling industries has been at higher levels since 2019, when the government conducted a 100-day \ncampaign\n\n      to review and inspect the health products and direct selling industries following negative media coverage generated by the healthcare-related product claims made by another direct selling company in Mainland China. Since 2019, we have been receiving\n      and addressing an increased number of government reviews, inspections, and inquiries and consumer complaints in Mainland China; our ability to hold certain business meetings has been limited; and negative media coverage has spread to include\n      additional companies, including ours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment regulators frequently make inquiries into our business activities and investigate complaints from consumers and others regarding our business. Some of these inquiries and investigations in the past have\n      resulted in the payment of fines by us or members of our sales force, interruption of sales activities at stores and warnings. Any determination by government regulators in these inquiries or investigations that our operations or activities, or the\n      activities of our sales force, are not in compliance with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines, extended interruptions of business, and termination of necessary licenses and permits, including our direct selling and other\n      licenses, all of which could harm our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe train our sales force in Mainland China on how our Mainland China business model differs from our global business model. However, Sales Leaders in Mainland China may attend regional and global events or interact\n      with Sales Leaders from other markets. Although our global model and Mainland China business model differ, mistakes may be made as to how those working in Mainland China should promote the business in Mainland China. These mistakes by our sales\n      force, or allegations of such mistakes, have, and may in the future, led to government reviews and investigations of our operations in Mainland China, as well as adverse publicity, reputational harm and adjustments or interruptions to our operations,\n      all of which has and could in the future have a significant negative impact on our revenue and the number of Sales Leaders and Customers in the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf direct selling regulations in Mainland China are modified, interpreted or enforced in a manner that results in negative changes to our business model or the imposition of a\n        range of potential penalties, our business could be significantly negatively impacted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government of Mainland China has adopted direct selling and anti-pyramiding regulations that impose significant restrictions and limitations on businesses in our industry. Most notably, the regulations prohibit\n      multi-level compensation, which is the basis of how we compensate our sales force outside of Mainland China. The regulations also prohibit overseas personnel from participating in direct selling in Mainland China. We have structured our business\n      model in Mainland China based on several factors: the guidance we have received from government officials, our interpretation of applicable regulations, our understanding of the practices of other international direct selling companies operating in\n      Mainland China, and our understanding as to how regulators are interpreting and enforcing the regulations. In Mainland China, we utilize sales employees to sell products through our retail stores and website; \nindependent\n\n\n        direct sellers, who can sell away from our stores where we have a direct selling license and a service center and can also sell through our website\n; and independent marketers, who are licensed business owners authorized to sell our products\n      at their own approved premises or through our stores and website. We generally compensate our Sales Leaders at a level that is competitive with other direct selling companies in the market and comparable to the compensation of our Sales Leaders\n      globally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther than our direct selling subsidiary, we also have a separate subsidiary in Mainland China that is a registered independent entity that engages in\n        cross-border e-commerce, through which we can sell a limited selection of products to consumers for their personal consumption. Cross-border e-commerce is not a permitted sales channel for direct selling in Mainland China. Members of our sales\n        force can contract with this entity, promote products on its behalf and receive compensation. Through this entity, we sell our \nageLOC Meta\n\n        product, which is not currently registered in Mainland China and, therefore, can only be sold to consumers for their personal consumption. Although we take measures (1) to maintain legal separation between our cross-border e-commerce entity and our\n        direct selling entity; and (2) to ensure the products sold on our cross-border e-commerce platform are for consumers\u2019 personal consumption only, our business in Mainland China could be negatively impacted if regulatory authorities elect to\n        attribute these cross-border e-commerce sales activities and related product claims, or the accompanying actions of our sales force, to our direct selling business, and make a determination they are in violation of direct selling or other\n        applicable laws.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nature of the political, regulatory and legal systems in Mainland China gives regulatory agencies at both the local and central levels of government broad discretion to interpret and enforce regulations as they\n      deem appropriate to promote social stability. We face a risk that regulators may change the way in which they currently interpret and enforce the direct selling regulations, or that such regulations may be modified. If our business practices are\n      deemed to be in violation of applicable regulations as they may be interpreted or enforced, in particular our use of the sales productivity of a Sales Leader him/herself and of the sales force that such Sales Leader trains, collaborates with,\n      supports and services in setting his/her salary or service fee and determining their position/title on a quarterly basis, then we could be sanctioned, required to change our business model, and/or have our direct selling license revoked, any of which\n      could significantly harm our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn January 2019, the Mainland China government announced a 100-day campaign to review and inspect the health products and direct selling industries. This campaign involved a number of regulatory agencies. Although the\n      100-day period has ended, there has continued to be a heightened level of regulatory scrutiny of these industries and of our business and products. For example, government authorities have not been issuing new licenses for direct selling since the\n      beginning of the 100-day action in early 2019. There is also uncertainty whether any changes to the regulations that apply to these industries will be made based on the review. If changes are made to any of the regulations that apply to our business\n      model, products or operations, our business could be harmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur ability to expand our business in Mainland China could be negatively impacted if we are unable to obtain additional necessary national and local government approvals in\n        Mainland China.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo expand our direct selling model into additional provinces in Mainland China, we currently must obtain a series of approvals from district, city, provincial and national government agencies with respect to each\n      province in which we wish to expand. Government authorities have not been issuing new licenses since the beginning of the 100-day action in early 2019. When the process for obtaining government approvals to conduct direct selling is operational, it\n      often evolves and is lengthy, as we are required to work with a large number of provincial, city, district and national government authorities. The complexity of the approval process as well as the government\u2019s continued cautious approach as direct\n      selling develops in Mainland China makes it difficult to predict the timeline for obtaining these approvals. Furthermore, any media or regulatory scrutiny of our business in Mainland China could increase the time and difficulty we may face in\n      obtaining additional licenses. If media or regulatory scrutiny of our business in Mainland China results in significant delays in obtaining licenses elsewhere in Mainland China, or if the current processes for obtaining approvals are delayed further\n      for any reason or are changed or interpreted differently than currently understood, our ability to receive direct selling licenses in Mainland China and our growth prospects in this market could be negatively impacted.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we are not able to register products for sale in Mainland China, our business could be harmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe face lengthy timelines with respect to product registrations in Mainland China. The process for obtaining product permits and licenses may require extended periods of time that may prevent us from launching new\n      product initiatives in Mainland China on the same timelines as other markets around the world. For example, products marketed in Mainland China as \u201chealth foods\u201d are subject to extensive laboratory and clinical analysis by government authorities, and\n      with a few exceptions, the product registration process in Mainland China takes a minimum of two years and may be substantially longer. If the recent media and government scrutiny of the healthcare industry results in more burdensome regulations\n      related to product registration, we may have more difficulty getting new wellness products registered for sale in Mainland China. We market both \u201chealth foods\u201d and \u201cgeneral foods\u201d in Mainland China. There is some risk associated with the common\n      practice in Mainland China of marketing a product as a \u201cgeneral food\u201d while seeking \u201chealth food\u201d classification. If government officials feel the categorization of our products is inconsistent with product claims, form of delivery, ingredients or\n      function, we could be prohibited or limited in marketing such products in Mainland China in their current form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we expand our direct selling channel, we face additional product marketing restrictions compared to our retail store channel. Under applicable direct selling regulations in Mainland China, we can only register\n      products for direct selling if we manufacture them and if they fall within categories that are authorized for direct selling, such as cosmetics, cleaning supplies, health foods, healthcare devices, small kitchen utensils and household appliances.\n      Products that are not categorized as direct selling products and products that are manufactured by third parties are prohibited from being marketed or sold through our direct sales channel, and t\nhe process for\n        registering products for the direct sales channel in Mainland China is subject to delays. \nIf we cannot successfully manufacture our own direct selling products, we will not be able to sell these products through the direct sales channel.\n      Any marketing or sale of non-direct selling products by our independent direct sellers could result in negative publicity, fines and other government sanctions being imposed against us, including if a product is initially classified as a direct\n      selling product but is later re-classified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisks Associated with Market Conditions and Competition\n\n\nOur markets are intensely competitive, and market conditions and the strengths of competitors may harm our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe markets for our products are intensely competitive. The success of our products is dependent on our ability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences and to maintain a product\n      offering and pipeline that is relevant and priced accessibly to consumers. Many competitors have much greater name recognition and financial resources than we have, which may give them a competitive advantage. For example, our Nu Skin products\n      compete directly with branded, premium retail products and with the products of other direct selling companies. Because of regulatory restrictions concerning claims about the efficacy of beauty and wellness products, we may have difficulty\n      differentiating our products from our competitors\u2019 products, and competing products entering the beauty and wellness market could harm our revenue. In addition, our business may be negatively impacted if we fail to adequately adapt to trends in\n      consumer behavior and technologies to meet consumers\u2019 needs and demands and reach a wider audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also compete with other direct selling companies and gig economy companies to attract and retain our \nsales force\n and consumers. Some of these competitors have longer\n      operating histories and greater visibility, name recognition and financial resources than we do. Some of our competitors have also adopted and could continue to adopt some of our successful business strategies, including our global \nsales \ncompensation plan. Consequently, to successfully compete in this industry, and attract and retain our \nsales force\n and consumers, we must ensure that our business\n      opportunities and \nsales \ncompensation plans are financially rewarding and innovative. Although we believe we have significant competitive advantages, we cannot assure that we will be able to continue to\n      successfully compete in this industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdverse publicity concerning our business, marketing plan, products or people could harm our business and reputation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowth in our sales force and consumers and our results of operations can be particularly impacted by adverse publicity. Given the nature of our operations, lack of clarity on applicable legal requirements and\n      standards, and our continuous need to recruit and retain consumers and members of our sales force, we are particularly vulnerable to adverse publicity. Specifically, we are susceptible to adverse publicity concerning:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nsuspicions about the legality and ethics of network marketing;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nmedia or regulatory scrutiny regarding our business and our business models, including in Mainland China;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nthe safety or effectiveness of our or our competitors\u2019 products or the ingredients in such products;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\ninquiries, investigations, fines, legal actions, or mandatory or voluntary product recalls involving us, our competitors, our business models or our respective products;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nthe actions of our current or former sales force and employees, including any allegations that our sales force or employees have overstated or made false product claims or earnings representations, or engaged\n                in unethical or illegal activity;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nmisperceptions about the types and magnitude of economic benefits offered at different levels of sales engagement in our business; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\npublic, governmental or media perceptions of the direct selling, beauty product, or wellness product industries generally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese issues have previously resulted in negative publicity and have harmed our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCritics of our industry, consumer protection groups, short sellers and other individuals have in the past and may in the future utilize the internet, the press and other means to publish criticisms of the industry, our\n      company and our competitors, or make allegations regarding our business and operations, or the business and operations of our competitors. In some cases, such adverse publicity or allegations can lead to government and regulatory scrutiny. We\n      continue to see adverse publicity regarding our company and the direct selling and healthcare products industries. We or others in our industry may receive similar negative publicity or allegations in the future, and it may harm our business and\n      reputation. Furthermore, the availability of social media channels can increase the likelihood of negative publicity because these channels are an easily accessible public forum. For example, if a member of our sales force makes an improper claim\n      about our products or business opportunity on social media, or if a critic of our company posts negative information about our company on social media, it is more likely to be disseminated widely and potentially noticed by the media or regulators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInability of products, platforms, business opportunities and other initiatives to gain or maintain sales force and market acceptance could harm our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur ability to improve our financial performance depends on our ability to proactively anticipate, gauge and react in a timely and effective manner to changes in consumer spending\n        patterns and preferences regarding products, platforms and business opportunities\n. Our operating results could be adversely affected if our products, platforms, business opportunities and other initiatives do not generate sufficient\n      enthusiasm and economic benefit to retain our existing consumers and sales force or to attract new consumers and sales force members. Potential factors affecting the attractiveness of our products, platforms, business opportunities and other\n      initiatives include, among other things, shifting consumer demands, perceived product quality and value, product exclusivity or effectiveness, demographic trends, the strength of our brand and public image, sustainability factors, DEI initiatives,\n      economic success in our business opportunity, the quality and accuracy of the data we use in running our business, our technology infrastructure and capabilities, restrictions in social or digital media for sharing products and attracting consumers,\n      adverse media attention or regulatory restrictions on claims. \nIf we are unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially\n        adversely affected. Likewise, if we are unable to anticipate changes in the gig and sharing economies and adapt our business opportunity accordingly, our ability to capture growth trends in the social commerce marketplace could be materially\n        adversely affected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, our ability to develop and introduce new products could be impacted by, among other things, government regulations, changing policies in social media and other communications platforms, the inability to\n      attract and retain qualified staff, the termination of third-party research and collaborative arrangements, intellectual property of competitors that may limit our ability to offer innovative products or that challenge our own intellectual property,\n      problems related to manufacturing or quality control, and difficulties in anticipating changes in consumer tastes and buying preferences. Our operating results could be adversely impacted if our products fail to gain or maintain sales force and\n      market acceptance or if our successful new products undercut the sales of our other products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo adapt our business to current macroeconomic trends, we\n are currently working\n          through a significant digital transformation in our business to achieve widespread adoption of social commerce in all of our markets. This transformation involves the development of new and enhanced digital tools for our Sales Leaders and\n          consumers, including new digital apps and an improved website design and functionality, as well as new products, including connected devices. Our digital transformation will require significant expenditures over the next several years.\n We\n        also face the risk that we will ultimately be unable to develop these items, that their development will be more costly than anticipated, or that the tools and products we develop will not meet the expectations of our sales force and/or consumers.\n        Any of these eventualities could have a material negative impact on our business, sales force, consumer development and revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, in our more mature markets, one of the challenges we face is keeping Sales Leaders with established businesses and high-income levels motivated and actively engaged in business building activities and in\n      developing new Sales Leaders. We may also face challenges retaining our sales force as the population of our markets transitions to a younger, millennial/Gen Z demographic, with its associated new and different dynamics of connection through social\n      media platforms, gratification and loyalty behaviors, particularly as this segment becomes a greater share of our revenue. Moreover, if sales through social sharing do not generate repeat purchases or subscriptions at the same rate as other sales,\n      this could create revenue volatility. Many in the younger demographic are particularly savvy with social sharing across multiple business opportunity platforms. There can be no assurance that our initiatives will generate lasting excitement and\n      engagement among our \nsales force\n in the long term or that planned initiatives will be successful in maintaining \nsales force\n activity and productivity or in\n      motivating Sales Leaders to remain engaged in business building and developing new Sales Leaders. Some initiatives may have unanticipated negative impacts on our \nsales force\n, particularly changes to our \nsales \ncompensation plans. The introduction of a new product or key initiative can also negatively impact other product lines to the extent our Sales Leaders focus their efforts on the new product or initiative.\n      In addition, if any of our products fails to gain acceptance, we could see an increase in product returns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct diversion may have a negative impact on our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see our products being sold through online marketplace sites and other distribution channels in certain markets. Although we continually take steps to control product diversion, including products sold in Mainland\n      China, this activity continues to be a challenge, and we believe that changes to our global sales compensation plan or increased use of online channels for conducting sales transactions have and may continue to lead to increased product diversion.\n      Product diversion causes confusion regarding our distribution channels and negatively impacts the ability of our \nsales force\n to sell our products. It also creates a negative impression regarding the\n      viability of the business opportunity for our \nsales force\n, which can harm our ability to recruit new people to join our \nsales force\n. Product diversion may also\n      cause brand erosion and negatively impact the brand value perception. Product diversion schemes may also involve illegal importation, investment or other activities and harm our brand if gray market or counterfeit goods are passed off as our own. If\n      we are unable to effectively address this issue or if diversion increases, our business could be harmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisks Associated with COVID-19\n\n\n\n\nEpidemics, including COVID-19, and other crises have and may continue to negatively impact our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the person-to-person nature of direct selling, our results of operations have been, and will likely continue to be, harmed if the fear of a communicable and rapidly spreading disease or other crises such as\n      natural disasters result in travel restrictions or cause people to avoid group meetings or gatherings or interaction with other people. It is difficult to predict the impact on our business, if any, of the emergence of new epidemics or other crises.\n      The outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 and ensuing pandemic resulted in significant contraction of economies around the world and interrupted global supply chains as many governments issued stay-at-home orders to combat COVID-19. Government-imposed\n      restrictions and public hesitance regarding in-person gatherings, travel and visiting public places have reduced our sales force\u2019s ability to hold sales meetings, resulted in cancellations of key sales leader events and incentive trips, and required\n      us to temporarily close our walk-in and fulfillment locations in some markets where we have such properties. The outbreak has also impacted our ability to obtain some ingredients and packaging as well as ship products in some markets. Our supply\n      chain and logistics have incurred some interruptions and cost impacts to date, and we could experience more significant interruptions and cost impacts or face more significant closures in the future, whether due to COVID-19 directly, workforce\n      (including the workforce of our supply chain) resistance to vaccination requirements, or other related factors. These factors and other events related to COVID-19 have negatively impacted our sales and operations and will likely continue to\n      negatively affect our business and our financial results. Although some of the negative impacts of COVID-19 have recently improved, this situation continues to be fluid and there is uncertainty regarding its duration and future impacts. For example,\n      COVID-19 variants have caused some of the pandemic\u2019s negative impacts to worsen or return. In addition, the productivity of our sales force has been, and could continue to be, negatively impacted as restrictions are lifted and our sales force is able\n      to more freely travel and take vacations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny significant decline in our operating results in the future could also adversely affect our financial position and liquidity. Under the terms of our existing credit facility, we are required to maintain certain\n      interest coverage and leverage ratios. In addition, our outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and related term loan impose debt service and amortization requirements. A significant deterioration in our results of operations in the future\n      as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could impact our ability to comply with our financial covenants and debt service and amortization obligations, which could result in an event of default under the terms of our credit facility. An event of default\n      under our credit facility could result in an inability to access funding under the agreement and the acceleration of our obligations, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, regulatory authorities closely scrutinize the product- and earnings-related claims made by direct-selling companies and their sales force, including claims related to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example,\n      during 2020 and 2021, the FTC issued letters that warned several direct-selling companies to remove and address claims that they or members of their sales force were making about their products\u2019 ability to treat or prevent COVID-19 and/or about the\n      earnings that people who have recently lost income could make. Although we take steps to educate our Brand Affiliates on proper claims, if our Brand Affiliates make improper claims, or if regulators determine we are making any improper claims, this\n      could lead to an FTC investigation and could harm our business and reputation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational Risks\n\n\nOur ability to conduct business in international markets may be affected by political, legal, tax and regulatory risks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur ability to capitalize on growth in new international markets and to maintain the current level of operations in our existing international markets is exposed to risks associated with our\n        international operations, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nthe possibility that a government might ban or severely restrict our sales compensation and business models;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nthe possibility that local civil unrest, political instability, or changes in diplomatic or trade relationships might disrupt our operations in one or more markets;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nthe lack of well-established or reliable legal systems in certain areas where we operate;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nthe presence of high inflation in the economies of international markets in which we operate;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nthe possibility that a government authority might impose legal, tax, customs, or other financial burdens on us or our sales force, due, for example, to the structure of our operations in various markets;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nthe possibility that a government authority might challenge the status of our sales force as independent contractors or impose employment or social taxes on our sales force; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nthe possibility that governments may impose currency remittance restrictions limiting our ability to repatriate cash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere has been an increasing level of tension in U.S.-China relations over the last few years. Given the significant size of our China business, our business could be harmed if relations continue\n        to deteriorate or additional sanctions or restrictions are imposed by either government. In addition, there have been adverse public reaction and media attention to statements made by representatives of other businesses related to these issues that\n        have adversely affected business. We could similarly face adverse public or media attention, and potentially increased regulatory scrutiny, as a result of increased trade or political tensions or any statements or actions by employees or our sales\n        force that generate publicity with respect to these issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are subject to financial risks as a result of our international operations, including exposure to foreign-currency fluctuations, currency controls and inflation in foreign\n        markets, all of which could impact our financial position and results of operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, approximately 80% \nof our sales occurred in markets outside of the United States in each market\u2019s respective local currency. Foreign-currency fluctuations affect our\n      financial position and results of operations. We purchase inventory primarily in the United States in U.S. dollars. In preparing our financial statements, we translate revenue and expenses in our markets outside the United States from their local\n      currencies into U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates. If the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to local currencies, our reported revenue, gross profit and net income will likely be reduced. Foreign-currency fluctuations also cause losses\n      and gains resulting from translation of foreign-currency-denominated balances on our balance sheet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also face the risk of currency controls. If foreign governments restrict transfers of cash out of their country and control exchange rates, we may be limited as to the timing and amount of cash we can repatriate and\n      may not be able to repatriate cash at beneficial exchange rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We typically fund the cash requirements of our operations in the United States\n      through intercompany dividends, intercompany loans and intercompany charges for products, use of intangible property, and corporate services. However, some markets impose government-approval or other requirements for the repatriation of dividends.\n      For example, in Mainland China, we are unable to repatriate cash from current operations in the form of dividends until we file the necessary statutory financial statements for the relevant period. We also have experienced delays in repatriating cash\n      from Argentina. As of December 31, 2021, we had $50.3 million in cash denominated in Chinese RMB, and our intercompany receivable with our Argentina subsidiary was $11.3 million.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, high levels of inflation and currency devaluations in any of our markets could negatively impact our balance sheet and results of operations. Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of non-U.S.\n      dollar monetary assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in our net earnings. For example, during 2018, Argentina was designated as a highly inflationary economy under U.S. generally accepted\n      accounting principles; accordingly, beginning with the third quarter of 2018, we began to apply highly inflationary accounting for our Argentina operations, which has resulted in additional foreign-currency charges. Other markets may be designated as\n      highly inflationary economies in the future, which could result in further foreign-currency charges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough we may engage in transactions intended to reduce our exposure to foreign-currency fluctuations, there can be no assurance that these transactions will be effective. Complex global political and economic\n      dynamics can affect exchange rate fluctuations. For example, the implementation of tariffs, border taxes or other measures related to the level of trade between the United States and other markets could impact the value of the U.S. dollar. It is\n      difficult to predict future fluctuations and the effect these fluctuations may have upon future reported results or our overall financial condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential changes to tariff and import/export regulations, and ongoing trade disputes between the United States and other jurisdictions may have a negative effect on global\n        economic conditions and our business, financial results and financial condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States and other foreign jurisdictions may change customs regulations or tariff rates that are applied to our imports or exports at any time. Tariff changes are difficult to predict and may cause us material\n      short-term or long-term cost fluctuations. We rely on the use of Free Trade Agreements that may experience alterations, suspensions or cancellations, which could increase our customs expense or otherwise harm our business. In addition to tariffs, any\n      actions taken by the United States or by foreign countries to further implement trade policy changes, including limiting foreign investment or trade, increasing regulatory scrutiny, or other actions that impact our ability to obtain necessary\n      licenses or approvals could negatively impact our business. These actions are unpredictable, and any of them could also have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, significantly reduce\n      global trade, restrict our access to suppliers or customers, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman Capital Risks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we are unable to retain our existing sales force and recruit additional people to join our sales force, our revenue may not increase and may even decline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur products are primarily marketed by our sales force, and we depend on them to generate virtually all of our revenue. Our sales force may terminate their services at any time, and like most direct selling companies,\n      we experience high turnover among our sales force from year to year. People who join our company to purchase our products for personal consumption or for short-term income goals frequently only stay with us for a short time. Sales Leaders who have\n      committed time and effort to build a sales organization will generally stay for longer periods. To increase our revenue, we must increase the number of and/or the productivity of our sales force. We must also expand our outreach and outbound efforts\n      to attract, connect and nurture new customers for a wider consumer base who purchase product and whom we can foster along a consumer journey to promote retention and higher lifetime value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have experienced periodic fluctuations in both Sales Leaders and Customers in the past and could experience such fluctuations again in the future. For example, our Sales Leaders in Mainland China declined 46% from\n      December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 due to such factors as meeting restrictions and negative media scrutiny. Our ability to retain our Sales Leaders and Customers could be affected as our sales force makes increased use of social sharing channels,\n      which may allow them to more easily engage their consumers and sales network in other opportunities. If our initiatives do not drive growth in both Sales Leaders and Customers, our operating results could be harmed. While we take many steps to help\n      train, motivate and retain our sales force, we cannot accurately predict how the number and productivity of our sales force may fluctuate because we rely primarily upon our Sales Leaders to find new consumers and to find, train and develop new Sales\n      Leaders. Our operating results could be harmed if we and our Sales Leaders do not generate sufficient interest in our business and its products to retain and motivate our existing sales force and attract new people to join our sales force.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number and productivity of our sales force is negatively impacted by several additional factors, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nany adverse publicity or negative public perception regarding us, our products or ingredients, our distribution channel, or our industry or competitors;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nlack of interest in, dissatisfaction with, or the technical failure of, existing or new products;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nlack of compelling products or income opportunities, including through our sales compensation plans and incentive trips and other offerings;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nnegative sales force reaction to changes in our sales compensation plans or to our failure to make changes \nthat would be necessary to keep our compensation competitive with the market\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\ninteractions with our company, including our actions to enforce our policies and procedures and the quality of our customer service;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nany regulatory actions or charges against us or others in our industry, as well as regulatory changes that impact product formulations and sales viability;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\ngeneral economic, business and public health conditions, including employment levels, employment trends such as the gig and sharing economies, and pandemics or other conditions that curtail person-to-person\n                interactions;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nchanges in the policies of social media platforms used to prospect or recruit potential consumers and sales force participants;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nrecruiting efforts of our competitors and changes in consumer-loyalty trends; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\npotential saturation or maturity levels in a given market, which could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain our sales force in such market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe depend on our key personnel and Sales Leaders, and the loss of the services provided by any of our executive officers, other key employees or key Sales Leaders could harm\n        our business and results of operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior and regional management, many of whom would be difficult to replace. Our senior and regional management employees may\n      voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time, and it is not uncommon for employees of direct-selling companies, including employees of our company, to terminate their employment and begin working for another direct-selling company. In\n      addition, we need to continue to attract and develop qualified management personnel to sustain growth in our markets. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel has been an increased challenge during the current competitive employment environment.\n      If we are not able to successfully retain existing personnel and identify, hire and integrate new personnel, our business and growth prospects could be harmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe success of our business also depends on our key Sales Leaders. \nAs of December 31, 2021, we had a global network of 1,367,559 Customers. Approximately 61,515 of our Customers were\n        Sales Leaders. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 456 Sales Leaders occupied the highest levels under our global sales compensation plan, and in Mainland China we have approximately 184 key Sales Leaders who play a significant role in managing,\n        training and servicing our sales force in that market and driving sales\n. We rely on these Sales Leaders (or other sales force members that they train, collaborate with, support and service) for a substantial majority of our revenue. As a\n      result, the loss of a high-level or key Sales Leader or a group of leading Sales Leaders, whether by their own choice or through disciplinary actions by us for violations of our policies and procedures, could negatively impact our growth and our\n      revenue.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisks Associated with Our Manufacturing and Operations\n\n\nProduction difficulties, quality control problems, inaccurate forecasting, shortages in ingredients, and reliance on our suppliers could harm our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduction difficulties, quality control problems, inaccurate forecasting and our reliance on third-party suppliers to manufacture and deliver products that meet our specifications in a timely manner could harm our\n      business. Occasionally, we have experienced production difficulties with respect to our products, including the availability of labor, raw materials, components, packaging and products that do not meet our specifications and quality control\n      standards. These production difficulties and quality problems have in the past, and could in the future, result in stock outages or shortages in our markets with respect to such products, harm our sales, or create inventory write-downs for unusable\n      products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, we and our supply chain acquire ingredients, components, products and packaging from third-party suppliers and manufacturers. A loss of any of these suppliers and any difficulties in finding or\n      transitioning to alternative suppliers could harm our business. In addition, we obtain some of our products and ingredients from sole suppliers that own or control the product formulations, ingredients or other intellectual property rights associated\n      with such products. We also license the right to distribute some of our products from third parties. In the event we are unable to maintain or renew our contracts with any of these suppliers, manufacturers or other third parties, we may need to\n      discontinue some products or develop substitute products, which could harm our revenue. In addition, if we experience supply shortages, price increases or regulatory impediments with respect to the raw materials, ingredients, components or packaging\n      we use for our products, we may need to seek alternative supplies or suppliers and may experience difficulties in finding replacements that are comparable in quality and price. For example, some of our wellness products, including \ng3\n juice, \nReishiMax\n, \nageLOC Meta\n and \nageLOC Youth\n (\nYouthspan\n\n      or \nY-Span\n in some markets), incorporate unique natural ingredients that are only harvested once per year and/or may have limited global supplies. If demand exceeds forecasts, we may have difficulties in\n      obtaining additional supplies to meet the excess demand until the next growing season. If we are unable to successfully respond to such issues, our business could be harmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe loss of or a disruption in our manufacturing, supply chain and distribution operations, or significant expenses or violations incurred by such operations, could adversely\n        affect our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a company engaged in manufacturing, distribution, and research and development on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, climate or environmental\n      events, fires, floods, earthquakes, labor shortages, strikes and other labor or industrial disputes, disruptions in logistics or information systems, loss or impairment of key manufacturing or distribution sites, import and export restrictions or\n      delays, product quality control, safety, licensing requirements and other regulatory or government issues, as well as natural disasters, pandemics, border disputes, global uncertainties, acts of terrorism and other external or macroeconomic factors\n      over which we have no control. These risks may be heightened if we consolidate certain of our manufacturing, distribution or supply facilities or if we are unable to successfully enhance our disaster recovery planning. These risks also increase as we\n      pursue our current strategy of acquiring manufacturing companies and thereby conducting more of our manufacturing in-house. The loss of, or disruption or damage to, any of our facilities or centers or those of our third-party manufacturers could have\n      a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions to the transportation channels used in our supply chain and distribution operations, including increased airport and shipping port congestion, a lack of\n      transportation capacity, increased fuel expenses, import or export controls or delays, and labor disputes or shortages. Disruptions in our container shipments may result in increased costs, including the additional use of air freight to meet demand.\n      Congestion to ports can affect previously negotiated contracts with shipping companies, resulting in unexpected increases in shipping costs and reduction in our profitability. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in several disruptions and\n      delays, as well as quantity limits and price increases, in our global transportation channels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous regulations, including labor regulations and environmental regulations that govern the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture,\n      use and disposal of chemicals and other materials. We will also likely become subject to new regulations in these areas, which could require substantial expenditures. Violations of existing or new requirements could result in financial penalties and\n      other enforcement actions and could require us to halt one or more portions of our operations until a violation is cured. The costs of curing incidents of non-compliance, resolving enforcement actions or private-party actions that might be initiated\n      against us, or of satisfying new legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur business could be negatively impacted if we fail to execute our product launch process or ongoing product sales due to difficulty in forecasting or increased pressure on\n        our supply chain, information systems and management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior to making a key product generally available for purchase, we typically do one or more introductory offerings of the product, such as a preview of the product to our Sales Leaders or other product introduction or\n      promotion. These offerings sometimes generate significant activity and a high level of purchasing, which results in a higher-than-normal increase in revenue during the quarter and skew year-over-year and sequential comparisons. These offerings may\n      also\n increase our product return rate. We have, and may in the future, experienced difficulty\n effectively managing growth associated with these offerings and may face\n\n        increased risk of improper sales force activities and related government scrutiny.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, the size and condensed schedule of these product offerings increase pressure on our supply chain and order processing systems. We have, and may in the future, failed to appropriately\n      scale our system capacity and operations in response to unanticipated changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products, which reduces our sales force\u2019s confidence in our business and could harm our reputation and\n      profitability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs our sales force increases its use of social platforms to interact with customers, our business results could be adversely affected if our implementation of new platforms and processes to support\n      our sales force is delayed. In addition, we are dependent on third parties for testing and delivery of portions of these and other of our information system platforms. Unanticipated changes or system failures by third parties could harm our ability\n      to meet the expectations of our sales force, thus resulting in harm to our revenue, reputation and sales force confidence in our systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we do not accurately forecast sales levels in each market for product launches or ongoing product sales, obtain sufficient ingredients, components or packaging, or produce a sufficient supply to\n      meet demand, we may incur higher expedited shipping costs and we may temporarily run out of stock of certain products, which could negatively impact the enthusiasm of our sales force and consumers. Conversely, if demand does not meet our expectations\n      for a product launch or ongoing product sales or if we change our planned launch strategies or initiatives, we could incur inventory write-downs. Each of these issues has impacted us in the past, and they could again occur with our ongoing product\n      launches. If we fail to effectively forecast product demand in the product launch process or for ongoing product sales, our reputation and profitability could be negatively impacted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we are unable to effectively manage our growth in certain markets, our operations could be harmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt times, we can experience significant growth in one or more of our markets. For example, during 2020 we experienced significant growth in some of the markets in our Americas and EMEA segments.\n        Growth can strain our ability to effectively manage our operations, as it requires us to expand our management team, labor force, technology bandwidth and capabilities, and manufacturing operations. Insufficient management execution to support\n        growth could result in, among other things, product delays or shortages, decreases in product quality, service level challenges, operating mistakes and errors, inadequate customer service, inappropriate claims or promotions by our sales force, and\n        governmental inquires and investigations, all of which could harm our revenue and ability to generate sustained growth and result in unanticipated expenses. In addition, we need to continue to attract and develop qualified management personnel to\n        sustain growth. If we are not able to successfully retain existing personnel and identify, hire and integrate new personnel, our business and growth prospects could be harmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystem failures, capacity constraints and other information technology difficulties could harm our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith global operations and a complex sales compensation plan, our business is highly dependent on efficiently functioning information technology systems, including websites, mobile applications, cloud providers, data\n      centers, databases, networks and other systems. We rely on these systems for accepting and processing sales orders, operating our sales force and customer support operations, tracking and compensating our sales force, conducting our corporate and\n      regional operations, preparing our financial statements, and other aspects of our business. Accordingly, the performance, reliability and availability of our systems are critical to our business, reputation, financial reporting, and ability to\n      attract and retain our sales force and customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur systems may be damaged or disrupted by fires, floods, earthquakes or other natural disasters, human error, telecommunications failures, power loss, physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, cyber attacks,\n      changes in our information technology systems or organization, and other events. We have, and may in the future, experienced system failures and outages. We cannot guarantee that the preventive measures we take, including redundancies, security\n      protocols, network protection mechanisms and other procedures currently in place, or that may be in place in the future, will be adequate to prevent or remedy system failure or interruption, data loss, security breaches or other data security\n      incidents. Furthermore, any mitigation process could take several days or more, thus resulting in a loss of revenue, loss of confidence of our sales force and harm to our reputation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, we make significant expenditures on our information technology infrastructure and other technology initiatives, and these items could become obsolete or impaired, which has and may in the future cause us\n      to incur significant expenses to address. For example, in 2018, following an evaluation of our information technology infrastructure and organization and our social sharing and digital initiatives, we determined to alter our strategic direction with\n      respect to some of our systems and tools, resulting in impairment charges of approximately $49 million. We also incurred approximately $22 million in severance payments and other expenses related to the reorganization of our Information Technology\n      Department and other corporate and regional offices. Additional cash outlay and new personnel were also necessary for execution of new plans and strategy. In this strategic shift in direction, we continue to identify and re-architect additional\n      legacy systems to help mitigate the risk and exposure these systems introduce to our business. We also continue to allocate resources to new technology and digital initiatives. There can be no assurance that we will be able to build and roll-out our\n      new technology and digital tools on a global scale or that they will function as intended, and these initiatives may entail significant expenses and could cause disruptions in our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur systems could also be strained by growth in our business. Although we work to expand and enhance our ecommerce features, network infrastructure and other technologies to accommodate increases in the volume of\n      traffic to our ecommerce channels, we may be unsuccessful in these efforts. Our failure, or our suppliers\u2019 failure, to achieve or maintain system capacity could significantly reduce our ability to fulfill orders and could harm our business,\n      reputation, revenue and financial condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny acquired companies or future acquisitions may expose us to additional risks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have acquired certain businesses, and we plan to continue to do so in the future as we encounter acquisition prospects that would complement our current product offerings, increase the size and geographic scope of\n      our operations or otherwise offer growth and operating efficiency opportunities. At any particular time, we may be in various stages of assessment, discussion and/or negotiation with regard to one or more potential acquisitions or investments, not\n      all of which will be consummated. Acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties and may be of businesses in which we lack operational or market experience. The financing for any of these acquisitions could dilute the interests of our\n      stockholders, result in an increase in our indebtedness or both. Our past acquisitions have, and future acquisitions could, entailed numerous risks, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\ndifficulties in integrating acquired operations or products;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nthe difficulties of imposing financial and operating controls on the acquired companies and their management and the potential costs of doing so;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nthe potential loss of key employees, customers, suppliers or distributors from acquired businesses and disruption to our direct selling channel;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nthe failure to achieve the strategic objectives of these acquisitions;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nincreased fixed costs;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nthe failure of the acquired businesses to achieve the results we have projected in either the near or long term;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nthe assumption of unexpected liabilities, including litigation risks;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nadverse effects on existing business relationships with our suppliers, sales force or consumers; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nrisks associated with entering markets or industries in which we have limited or no prior experience, including limited expertise in running the business, developing the technology, and selling and servicing\n                the products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business, or a failure to adjust our fixed costs quickly enough or sufficiently to adapt to rapidly changing market conditions, could have a material\n      adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, consummate acquisitions on favorable terms or realize the anticipated\n      benefits of an acquisition. It is also possible that our acquired companies could sell products or utilize a business model similar to that of our Nu Skin business, which could be viewed negatively by our sales force and result in a reduction in our\n      revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulations governing our products, including the formulation, registration, pre-approval, marketing and sale of our products, could harm our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur products are subject to extensive government regulation by numerous federal, state and local government agencies and authorities. Many of these laws and regulations involve a high level of subjectivity, are subject\n      to interpretation, and vary significantly from market to market. These laws and regulations can, and often do, have several impacts on our business, including but not limited to:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\ndelays, or altogether prohibitions, in introducing or selling a product or ingredient in one or more markets;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nd\nelays and expenses associated with the registration and approval process for a product;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nlimitations on our ability to import products into a market;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\ndelays and expenses associated with compliance, such as record keeping, documentation of the properties of certain products, labeling, and scientific substantiation;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nlimitations\n on the claims we can make regarding our products; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nproduct \nreformulations, or \nthe \nrecall or discontinuation of certain products that cannot be reformulated to comply with new regulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have observed a general increase in regulatory activity and activism in the United States and across many markets globally where we operate, and the regulatory landscape is becoming more complex with increasingly\n      strict requirements. In particular, the requirements are impacting the ingredients we can include in our products, the accepted quantities of those ingredients and the quality and characterization of the ingredients. Global regulators have in recent\n      years become overall more restrictive on the accepted levels of active ingredients that we can use in our product, in some cases banning them outright. They have also become more restrictive on permitted contaminant levels in ingredients and, in many\n      cases, have forced complete removal of such contaminants. In certain cases, such as regarding some pesticides which are virtually ubiquitous in nature, it has proven difficult to comply with the requirements. Further, many of the restrictions\n      regarding ingredient quality are not directly applicable to our products, leaving the possibility that our interpretation of compliance may not match that of the enforcing authorities. Often there is a lack of an equivalent active ingredient present\n      in the marketplace. In other cases, the removal or reduction of a technical ingredient, such as various types of parabens, leads to a significant change to the character of the product that may make it no longer desirable or safe to the consumer. If\n      this trend in new regulations continues, we may find it necessary to alter some of the ways we have traditionally marketed our products in order to stay in compliance with a changing regulatory landscape and this could add to the costs of our\n      operations and/or have an adverse impact on our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany laws and regulations govern the registration, pre-market approval or other aspects of regulatory oversight of our products. For example, in the United States, some legislators and industry critics have pushed for\n      years to increase regulatory authority by the FDA over nutritional supplements. In 2011, the FDA proposed draft guidance to clarify the FDA\u2019s interpretation of the dietary ingredient notification requirements, and in 2016, the FDA issued a revised\n      draft guidance that superseded the 2011 version. This draft guidance is not yet final but appears to indicate that the FDA is expanding its definition of what is considered a \u201cnew dietary ingredient\u201d in the United States. The industry has worked with\n      the FDA for several years, providing comments to the FDA to modify this guidance. While still in flux, if enacted in final form as proposed, this guidance could impose new and significant regulatory barriers for our nutritional supplement products or\n      unique ingredients, which could delay or inhibit our ability to formulate, introduce and sell nutritional supplements as we have in the past. We face similar pressures in our other markets, which continue to set restrictions on ingredients and their\n      acceptable maximum levels, as well as on ingredient characterization, quality and levels. In Europe, for example, we are unable to market supplements that contain ingredients that were not marketed in Europe prior to May 1997 (\u201cnovel foods\u201d) without\n      going through an extensive registration and pre-market approval process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FDA currently does not have a pre-market approval system for cosmetics. However, cosmetic products may become subject to more extensive regulation in the future. These events could interrupt the marketing and sale\n      of our products, severely damage our brand reputation and image in the marketplace, increase the cost of our products, cause us to fail to meet customer expectations or cause us to be unable to deliver merchandise in sufficient quantities or of\n      sufficient quality to our stores, any of which could result in lost sales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur operations could be harmed if new laws or regulations are enacted that restrict our ability to market or distribute our products or impose additional burdens or requirements on us in order to continue selling our\n      products. In addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations and enforcement of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketability of our\n      products, resulting in significant loss of net sales. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when\n      and if promulgated, would have on our business. If new or existing laws and regulations restrict, inhibit or delay our ability to introduce or market our products or limit the claims we are able to make regarding our products, this could have a\n      material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. If we fail to comply with the laws and regulations governing our products, we could face enforcement action, and we could be fined or forced to alter or stop selling\n      our products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment regulations and private party actions relating to the marketing and advertising of our products and services may restrict, inhibit or delay our ability to sell our\n        products and harm our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment authorities regulate advertising and product claims regarding the efficacy and benefits of our products. These regulatory authorities typically require adequate and reliable scientific substantiation to\n      support any marketing claims. What constitutes such reliable scientific substantiation can vary widely from market to market and there is no assurance that the research and development efforts that we undertake to support our claims will be deemed\n      adequate for any particular product or claim. If we are unable to show adequate and reliable scientific substantiation for our product claims, or if our marketing materials or the marketing materials of our \nsales\n        force\n make claims that exceed the scope of allowed claims for dietary supplements, cosmetics or devices that we offer, the United States Food and Drug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d) or other regulatory authorities could take enforcement action\n      requiring us to revise our marketing materials, amend our claims or stop selling certain products, which could harm our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, in recent years, the FDA has issued warning letters to many cosmetic companies alleging improper structure/function claims regarding their cosmetic products, including, for example, product claims\n      regarding gene activity, cellular rejuvenation, and rebuilding collagen. There is a degree of subjectivity in determining whether a claim is an improper structure/function claim. Given this subjectivity and our research and development focus on the\n      sources of aging and the influence of certain ingredients on gene expression, there is a risk that we could receive a warning letter, be required to modify our product claims or take other actions to satisfy the FDA if the FDA determines any of our\n      marketing materials include improper structure/function claims for our cosmetic products. In addition, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers have filed class action lawsuits against some of our competitors after our competitors received these FDA warning letters.\n      There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to government actions or class action lawsuits, which could harm our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the United States, the FTC\u2019s Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising (\u201cGuides\u201d) require disclosure of material connections between an endorser and the company they are endorsing,\n      and they generally do not allow marketing using atypical results. Our \nsales force\n has historically used testimonials and \u201cbefore and after\u201d photos to market and sell some of our popular products such as \nour \nageLOC Spa \nsystems\n\u00a0\nand \nageLOC Transformation\n anti-aging skin care system. We intend to continue to use testimonials for our popular products,\n        including weight management products and beauty products. In highly regulated and scrutinized product categories such as weight management, i\nf we or our \nsales force\n fails to comply with the Guides\n      or makes improper product claims, the FTC could bring an enforcement action against us and we could be fined and/or forced to alter our marketing materials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur operations could be harmed if we fail to comply with Good Manufacturing Practices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross our markets, there are regulations on a diverse range of Good Manufacturing Practices that apply to us and to our vendors covering product categories such as dietary supplements, cosmetics, foods,\n      over-the-counter drugs and medical devices. The Good Manufacturing Practices impose stringent requirements on a variety of topics, including vendor qualifications, ingredient identification, manufacturing controls and record keeping. Ingredient\n      identification requirements, which often require us to confirm the levels, identity and potency of ingredients listed on our product labels within a narrow range, are particularly burdensome and difficult for us because our products contain many\n      different ingredients. Additionally, certain Good Manufacturing Practices obligate us to track and periodically report adverse events to government agencies. Compliance with these increasing regulations may further increase the cost of manufacturing\n      certain of our products as we work with our vendors to assure they are qualified and in compliance. In addition, our operations could be harmed if regulatory authorities determine that we or our vendors are not in compliance with these regulations or\n      if public reporting of adverse events harms our reputation for quality and safety. A finding of noncompliance may result in administrative warnings, penalties or actions impacting our ability to continue selling certain products, including public\n      withdrawals, seizures and recalls. \nFor example, in prior years, we have had product recalls in the United States based on labeling issues. Problems associated with product recalls could be exacerbated due to the\n        global nature of our business because a recall in one jurisdiction could lead to recalls in other jurisdictions. In addition, these risks associated with noncompliance could increase as we acquire businesses, including the businesses in our Rhyz\n        strategic investment arm and any businesses we may acquire in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf our current or any future device products are determined to be medical devices in a particular geographic market, or if our sales force uses these products for medical\n        purposes or makes improper medical claims, our ability to continue to market and distribute such devices could be harmed, and we could face legal or regulatory actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of our strategies is to market unique and innovative products that allow our sales force to distinguish our products, including our \nageLOC Spa\n systems,\n      \nPharmanex BioPhotonic\n\u00a0\nScanner,\n\u00a0\nageLOC LumiSpa\n and \nageLOC Boost\n. Any determination by\n      regulatory authorities in our markets that these products or any future devices must receive clearance or be registered as medical devices could restrict our ability to import or sell the product in such market until registration is obtained. While\n      we have not been required to register our \nageLOC Spa\n systems, \nPharmanex BioPhotonic Scanner\n, \nageLOC LumiSpa\n or \nageLOC Boost\n as medical devices in most of our markets, we have registered our \nageLOC Spa\n systems as a medical device in Indonesia, Thailand, Peru and Colombia. In\n      addition, we have received clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration to market our facial spa for over-the-counter use. We have registered \nageLOC Boost\n as a medical device in Thailand, and\n      we intend to do so in the United States as well. There have been legislative proposals in the Philippines relating to the regulation of medical devices that could affect the way we market our \nageLOC Spa\n\n      systems, \nPharmanex BioPhotonic Scanner\n, \nageLOC LumiSpa\n and \nageLOC Boost\n in this market. In addition, if our sales force\n      attempts to import or export products from one market to another in violation of our policy, makes medical claims regarding our products or uses our products to perform medical diagnoses or other activities limited to licensed professionals or\n      approved medical devices (in markets where the product is not approved), it could negatively impact our ability to market or sell these products and subject us to legal or regulatory actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere necessary, obtaining medical device registrations and clearances could require us to provide documentation concerning product manufacturing and clinical utility, to make design,\n        specification and manufacturing process modifications to meet standards imposed on medical device companies, and to modify our marketing claims regarding the registered product. While we successfully obtained clearance to market our facial spa for\n        over-the-counter use in the United States, and registered our \nageLOC Spa\n systems as a medical device in Indonesia, Thailand, Peru and Colombia, because medical device regulations vary widely from market to\n        market, there can be no assurance we will not face challenges or delays in obtaining clearance in other markets, or that we will be able to make any required modifications or provide documentation necessary to obtain clearance. If we obtain such\n        medical device clearance in order to sell a product in one market, such clearance may be used as precedent for requiring similar approval for the product in another market, or for similar products in the same market. These additional requirements\n        could increase the cost associated with manufacturing and selling these products as non-medical devices in such markets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe may incur product liability claims that could harm our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe sell a variety of different products for human consumption and use, including cosmetics, dietary supplements, conventional foods, OTC drugs and devices. Our cosmetics and conventional foods, as well as some of our\n      dietary supplements, are not generally subject to pre-market approval or registration processes so we cannot rely upon a government safety panel to qualify or approve our products for use, and some ingredients may not have long histories of human\n      consumption or use. We rely upon published and unpublished safety information including clinical studies on ingredients used in our products and conduct our own clinical and safety studies on some key ingredients and products, but not all products. A\n      product may be safe for the general population when consumed or used as directed but could cause an adverse reaction for some individuals, such as a person who has a health condition or allergies or who is taking a prescription medication. While we\n      include what we believe are adequate instructions and warnings and we have historically had low numbers of reported reactions, previously unknown adverse reactions could occur. If we discover that our products are causing adverse reactions, or if we\n      determine that any of our employees have not properly handled reports of adverse reactions, we could suffer further adverse publicity or government sanctions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result of the type of products that we sell, we may be subject to various product liability claims, including that the products fail to meet quality or manufacturing specifications, contain contaminants, include\n      inadequate instructions as to their proper use, include inadequate warnings concerning side effects and interactions with other substances or for persons with health conditions or allergies, or cause adverse reactions or side effects. Consumer\n      protection laws and regulations governing our business continue to expand, and in some states such as California, class-action lawsuits based on increasingly novel theories of liability are expanding. Product liability claims could increase our\n      costs, cause negative publicity, and adversely affect our business and financial results. As we continue to offer an increasing number of new products through large product offerings our product liability risk may increase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf our \nsales force\n or employees provide improper or inappropriate advice regarding our products, their use or safety, we may be subject to additional product liability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have generally elected to self-insure our product liability risks. We continue to periodically evaluate whether we can and should obtain product liability insurance. Based upon our current approach to product\n      liability risk management, if any of our products are found to cause any injury or damage or we become subject to product liability claims, we will be subject to the full amount of liability associated with any injuries or damages. This liability\n      could be substantial and may exceed our existing reserves and harm our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\n\n\nWe may become involved in legal proceedings and other matters that could adversely affect our operations or financial results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have been, and regularly are, a party to litigation, government inquiries or investigations, audits or other legal matters. These legal proceedings may include, among other things, claims alleging violation of the\n      federal securities laws or state corporate laws, or claims related to employment matters, intellectual property, fair-competition/anti-trust laws, our products, business opportunity or advertising, or other matters. Claims may be brought by a\n      regulator, investor, member of our sales force, consumer, employee or other private parties and in some cases may be brought as class action lawsuits. For example, in 2014, we were named as a defendant in a purported class action complaint relating\n      to negative media and regulatory scrutiny of our business in Mainland China and as a nominal defendant in a shareholder derivative suit relating to the same issues. Also, beginning in 2014, we were in discussions with the Securities and Exchange\n      Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), which discussions were focused on a charitable donation we made in Mainland China in 2013 and issues related thereto. In April 2015, the SEC informed us that it was initiating a non-public, formal investigation into these issues.\n      We also have been involved in two separate disputes with customs authorities in Japan with respect to customs assessments on several of our products. Although we settled the purported class action, shareholder derivative action and SEC investigation\n      during 2016 and the Japan courts reached final decisions on the customs disputes in 2013 and 2018, these matters were, and any future matters that we may become involved in may be, expensive and time consuming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur increased activity during the past several years with acquisitions, divestments and other investment-related activities introduces an additional area of litigation risk, and we have had litigation and threats of\n      litigation related to these matters. Other parties in the transactions or potential transactions, or other parties involved in the businesses themselves, could bring claims against us. For example, w\ne are currently\n        in litigation with Don Roberts, a dairy farmer who claims he is a general partner in our indoor-growing business and related businesses. Mr. Roberts also seeks damages exceeding $250 million. Although we believe Mr. Roberts\u2019s claims are without\n        merit and we intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves, there can be no assurance that the resolution of this or other cases will be favorable to us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general, litigation claims, regulatory actions or other legal matters are expensive and time consuming and can result in settlements, adverse rulings or damages that could significantly affect financial results and\n      the conduct of our business. It is not possible to predict the final resolution of any legal proceeding to which we may become party, and the impact of these matters on our business, results of operations and financial condition could be material.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-compliance with anti-corruption laws could harm our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur international operations are subject to various anti-corruption laws, including principally the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d). The FCPA and the anti-corruption laws of other jurisdictions where we\n      operate generally prohibit companies and their agents or intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and they require companies to maintain accurate books and records and internal accounting\n      controls. We dedicate time and resources to internal investigations of any allegation that we are not or may not be in compliance with anti-corruption laws. Additionally, such allegations, even if untrue, may result in a government investigation,\n      particularly given the trend in recent years of increased anti-corruption law enforcement activity and regulatory investigative actions by regulators in numerous jurisdictions, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC. Our corporate\n      policies require all employees to comply with the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA\u2019s books-and-records and internal-accounting-controls requirements. Any regulatory determination, however, that our operations or\n      activities are not in compliance with existing anti-corruption laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines and other penalties from U.S. or other regulatory entities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2016, we reached a resolution with the SEC to pay $765,688 to settle the SEC\u2019s allegations that our books and records and internal controls related to a charitable contribution in Mainland China in 2013 were\n      insufficient. In agreeing to this settlement, we neither admitted nor denied the SEC\u2019s findings. Although we have implemented additional anti-corruption policies, controls and training globally to prevent similar situations from arising in the\n      future, we cannot be certain that these efforts will be effective or prevent future fines or penalties under the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws. Our competitors operating in Mainland China have also faced similar allegations from U.S. regulators\n      and been fined accordingly in some circumstances. For example, in 2020, one of our competitors entered into a large settlement with U.S. regulators related to allegations that its employees violated the FCPA in Mainland China.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing or new laws might be administered or\n      interpreted. Alleged or actual violations of any such existing or future laws (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others) may result in criminal or civil sanctions or reputational harm, which could\n      have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA failure of our internal controls over financial reporting or our regulatory compliance efforts could harm our stock price and our financial and operating results or could\n        result in fines or penalties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have implemented internal controls to help ensure the completeness and accuracy of our financial reporting and to detect and prevent fraudulent actions within our financial and accounting processes. We have also\n      implemented compliance policies and programs to help ensure that our employees and \nsales force\n comply with applicable laws and regulations. Our internal audit team regularly audits our internal controls and\n      various aspects of our business and compliance program, and we regularly assess the effectiveness of our internal controls. There can be no assurance, however, that our internal or external assessments and audits will identify all fraud,\n      misstatements in our financial reporting, and significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls. Material weaknesses have in the past, and may in the future, resulted in a material misstatement of our financial results,\n      requiring us to restate our financial statements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom time to time, we initiate further investigations into our business operations to further bolster our regulatory compliance efforts or based on the results of our internal and external audits or on complaints,\n      questions or allegations made by employees or other parties regarding our business practices and operations. In addition, our business and operations may be investigated by applicable government authorities. In the event any of these investigations\n      identify material violations of applicable laws by our employees, \nsales force or affiliates\n, we could be subject to adverse publicity, fines, penalties or loss of licenses or permits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisks Associated with Taxes, Customs and Interest\n\n\nGovernment authorities may question our tax or customs positions or change their laws in a manner that could increase our effective tax rate or otherwise harm our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a U.S. company doing business globally, we are subject to applicable tax and customs laws, including those relating to intercompany pricing regulations and transactions between our corporate entities in the\n      jurisdictions in which we do business. Periodically, we are audited by tax and customs authorities around the world. If authorities challenge our tax or customs positions, including those regarding transfer pricing, customs valuation and\n      classification, value added taxes (VAT), withholding taxes, payroll taxes, and other applicable taxes, we may be subject to penalties, interest and payment of back taxes or customs duties. The tax and customs laws in each jurisdiction change from\n      time to time and are further subject to interpretation by the local government agencies.\u00a0 Despite our best efforts to be aware of and comply with tax and customs laws, including changes to and interpretations thereof, there is a potential risk that\n      the local authorities may argue that we are out of compliance. Such situations may require that we defend our positions and/or adjust our operating procedures in response to such changes. We are currently subject to ongoing audits that are at various\n      levels of review, assessment, or appeal in different markets involving issues of transfer pricing, income taxes, VAT, withholding taxes, payroll taxes, and other taxes. In some circumstances, additional taxes, interest and penalties have been\n      assessed. We have reserved in our consolidated financial statements an amount that we believe represents the most likely outcome of the resolution of these audits, but if we are incorrect in our assessment, we may have to pay additional amounts,\n      which could potentially be material. Ultimate resolution of these ongoing audits may take several years, and the outcome is uncertain. Any or all of these potential risks may increase our effective tax rate, increase our overall tax or customs\n      expense or otherwise harm our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could be subject to changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities, which could have a\n        material and adverse impact on our operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are subject to taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions, where our subsidiaries are organized. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be\n      subject to change, with or without notice, due to economic, political and other conditions. As a result, significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for income taxes. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by\n      numerous factors, such as intercompany transactions, changes in our business operations, acquisitions and dispositions, entry into new markets, the amount of our earnings and where earned, losses incurred in jurisdictions, the inability to realize\n      tax benefits, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, uncertain tax positions, allocation and apportionment of state taxes, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation. In addition, U.S. and\n      foreign governments may enact tax laws or enter into tax treaties that could result in further changes to global taxation and may materially affect our operating results and financial condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation or other tax controversy\n      could have a material effect on our operating results, cash flows or financial condition in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome\n      resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our estimates for the tax accruals are reasonable, the outcome of audits, investigations and any other tax controversies could be materially different\n      from our tax accruals, which could materially impact our financial results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransition from LIBOR to an alternative benchmark interest rate could have an adverse effect on our overall financial position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur indebtedness levels and the required payments on such indebtedness may be impacted by expected reforms related to LIBOR. The variable interest rates payable under our credit facility are linked to LIBOR as the\n      benchmark for establishing such rates. Recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and reform proposals regarding LIBOR are expected to ultimately cause LIBOR to be discontinued or become unavailable as a benchmark rate. Although our\n      credit facility includes mechanics to facilitate the adoption by us and our lenders of an alternative benchmark rate for use in place of LIBOR, no assurance can be made that such alternative rate will perform in a manner similar to LIBOR and may\n      result in interest rates that are higher or lower than those that would have resulted had LIBOR remained in effect. In addition, as previously disclosed, we currently plan to refinance our credit facility during 2022. There can be no assurance that\n      credit will be available on favorable terms, including a favorable interest rate, which could negatively impact our liquidity and ability to fund our business initiatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntellectual Property Risks\n\n\n\n\nWe may be subject to claims of infringement on the intellectual property rights or trade secrets of others, resulting in costly litigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States involving patents and other intellectual property rights. In particular, there has been an increase in the filing of suits alleging\n      infringement of intellectual property rights, which pressure defendants into entering into settlement arrangements quickly to dispose of such suits, regardless of their merit. Other companies or individuals may allege that we, or our \nsales force\n, consumers, licensees or other parties indemnified by us, infringe on their intellectual property rights. Even if we believe that such claims are without merit, defending such intellectual property\n      litigation can be costly, distract management\u2019s attention and resources, and the outcome is inherently uncertain. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or\n      license agreements, pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products. Any of these results may adversely affect our financial condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe employ individuals who were previously employed at other beauty or wellness product companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. To the extent that our employees are involved in research areas that\n      are similar to those in which they were involved with their former employers, we may be subject to claims that such employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former\n      employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights or our proprietary information and know-how, our ability to compete could be negatively impacted and the value of\n        our products could be adversely affected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the value associated with our product innovations and our brand equity. We rely upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United\n      States and other markets, and non-disclosure, confidentiality and other types of agreements with our employees, \nsales force\n, customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish, maintain and enforce our\n      intellectual property rights. Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or misappropriated, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to provide\n      competitive advantages, which could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other competitive harm. In addition, the laws of certain foreign markets where we have significant business, including\n      markets such as Mainland China, do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe costs required to protect our patents and trademarks may be substantial or even not practical. We have filed patent and trademark applications globally to protect our intellectual property rights in our new\n      technologies; however, there can be no assurance that our patent and trademark applications will be approved and issue, that any patents and trademarks issued will adequately protect our intellectual property, or that such patents and trademarks will\n      not be challenged by third parties or found by a judicial authority to be invalid or unenforceable. Moreover, many of our products rely on technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain\n      licenses and technologies from these third parties on reasonable terms or at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom time to time, we become aware of potential violations of our intellectual property rights. For example, we are aware of some products that may infringe on our intellectual property related to the \nageLOC LumiSpa\n device. To enforce and protect our intellectual property rights, we may initiate litigation against third parties, such as patent, copyright and trademark infringement suits or interference\n      proceedings and seek indemnification by contract or otherwise. Any lawsuits that we initiate could be expensive, take significant time and divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, and we may ultimately fail to prevail or recover on\n      any indemnification claim. Litigation also puts our patents and trademarks at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent and trademark applications at risk of not issuing. Additionally, we may provoke third parties to assert\n      claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially valuable. The occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our financial condition or diminish\n      our investments in this area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to patented technology, we rely on our unpatented proprietary technology, trade secrets, processes and know-how. We generally seek to protect this information by confidentiality, non-disclosure and\n      assignment of invention agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and third parties. Our employees may leave to work for competitors. Our sales force members may seek other opportunities. These agreements may be breached, and we\n      may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may be disclosed to or otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. To the extent that our current or former employees, sales force,\n      consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. If, for any of the above reasons, our intellectual property is disclosed\n      or misappropriated, it would harm our ability to protect our rights and adversely affect our financial condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Security and Privacy Risks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCyber security risks and the failure to maintain the integrity of company, employee, sales force or guest data could expose us to data loss, litigation, liability and harm to\n        our reputation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe collect, store and transmit large volumes of company, employee, sales force and guest data, including payment card information, personally identifiable information and other personal\n        information, for business purposes, including for transactional and promotional purposes, and our various information technology systems enter, process, summarize and report such data. The connected devices that we are developing and plan to\n        introduce will also collect consumer data. The integrity and protection of this data is critical to our business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are subject to significant security and privacy regulations, as well as requirements imposed by the payment card industry. For example, during 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation went\n        into effect in the European Union, imposing increased data protection regulations, the violation of which could result in fines of up to 4% of our annual consolidated revenue. Many other jurisdictions have similarly enacted security and privacy\n        regulations, including California and Mainland China, and we believe this trend will continue. In the United States, congressional committees have held preliminary hearings about the advisability of a federal data privacy law, but it is uncertain\n        whether the federal government will adopt such a law and whether it would preempt state data privacy laws. The prospect of new data privacy laws and ambiguity regarding the interpretation of existing laws has resulted in significant uncertainty and\n        compliance costs. In addition to laws specifically governing privacy and data security, in some cases, federal and state regulators and state attorneys general and administrative agencies have interpreted more general consumer protection laws to\n        impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. Although we monitor regulatory developments in this area, any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with these requirements could subject us to significant\n        penalties, lawsuits and negative publicity and require changes to our business practices. In particular, maintaining compliance with these and other evolving regulations and requirements around the world often requires changes to our information\n        system architecture and data storage processes. Making these changes is, and will likely continue to be, difficult and expensive. Investigations by the regulators of data security laws could also result in the payment of fines and harm our\n        reputation. Private actions by affected individuals could also result in significant monetary or reputational damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, a failure to adhere to the payment card industry\u2019s data security standards could cause us to incur penalties from payment card associations, termination of our ability to accept credit\n        or debit card payments, litigation and adverse publicity, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, a penetrated or compromised data system or the intentional, inadvertent or negligent release, misuse or disclosure of data could result in theft, loss, or fraudulent or unlawful use of\n      company, employee, sales force or guest data. Although we take measures to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of our data systems, we experience cyber attacks of varying degrees and types on a regular basis. Our infrastructure may be\n      vulnerable to these attacks, and in some cases it could take time to discover them. Our security measures may also be breached due to employee error or malfeasance, system errors or otherwise. This risk is heightened as a result of the current\n      COVID-19 pandemic as many of our employees are working remotely. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, users, or customers to disclose sensitive information to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 or customers\u2019\n      data. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in the unauthorized disclosure, misuse or loss of sensitive information and lead to significant legal and financial exposure, regulatory inquiries or investigations, loss of confidence by our\n      sales force and customers, disruption of our operations, damage to our reputation, and costs associated with remediating the incident. These risks are heightened as we work with third-party providers, including providers of mobile and cloud\n      technologies, and as our sales force uses social media, as the providers and social media platforms could be vulnerable to the same types of breaches and other risks. Acquisition activity, which we have engaged in and which we may continue to engage\n      in, may also heighten these risks, as the systems of the companies we acquire are not under our control prior to the acquisitions and it may take time to evaluate these systems and implement appropriate modifications to them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSustainability Risks\n\n\nOur business could be negatively impacted by corporate citizenship and sustainability matters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are increased and increasing expectations and focus from certain investors, Brand Affiliates, consumers, employees, regulators and other stakeholders concerning corporate citizenship and sustainability matters, including environmental,\n      social and governance matters; packaging; responsible sourcing; and diversity, equity and inclusion matters. From time to time, we announce certain initiatives and goals in these areas. We could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of\n      such initiatives or goals or in meeting stakeholders\u2019 expectations, or we could fail in accurately reporting our progress on such initiatives, goals and expectations. Moreover, the standards by which corporate citizenship and sustainability efforts\n      and related matters are measured are developing and evolving, and certain areas are subject to assumptions. The standards or assumptions could change over time. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope of our initiatives or goals or\n      perceived as not acting responsibly in connection with these matters, such as with our carbon footprint, recyclability of our packaging, ingredients used in our products or the sourcing of such ingredients. Any such matters, or related corporate\n      citizenship and sustainability matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\n\n\n\nThe market price of our Class A common stock is subject to significant fluctuations due to a number of factors that are beyond our control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Class A common stock closed at $32.59 per share on January 31, 2020 and closed at $48.19 per share on January 31, 2022. During this two-year period, our common stock traded as low as $12.31 per share and as high as\n      $63.85 per share. Many factors, including some we may be unable to control, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fall.

For\n      example, an increase in oil prices would likely cause our shipping expenses to increase, which would negatively affect our profitability. In addition, economic conditions may adversely impact access to capital for us and our suppliers, may decrease\n      the ability of our sales force and consumers to obtain or maintain credit cards, and may otherwise adversely impact our operations and overall financial condition. There also appears to be increased concerns about potential inflationary pressures,\n      which could have a negative impact on our business if it impacts the discretionary spending of our consumers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "item7": ">ITEM 7.\n\n    \n\n\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included in\n        this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness Overview\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Products\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNu Skin Enterprises, Inc. develops and distributes a comprehensive line of premium-quality beauty and wellness solutions in approximately 50 markets worldwide. In 2021, our revenue of\n        $2.7 billion was primarily generated by \nour three primary brands: our beauty products brand, Nu Skin; our wellness products brand, Pharmanex; and our anti-aging brand, ageLOC. \nWe operate in the direct\n        selling channel, primarily utilizing person-to-person marketing to promote and sell our products, including through the use of social and digital platforms.\u00a0 In all of our markets besides Mainland China, we refer to members of our independent sales\n        force as \u201cBrand Affiliates\u201d because their primary role is to promote our brand and products through their personal and social networks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to our core Nu Skin business, we also explore new areas of growth and opportunity through our strategic investment arm known as Rhyz Inc. Rhyz investments include beauty and wellness\n        product manufacturing companies and other investments. In 2021, the Rhyz companies generated $174.7 million, or 6%, of our 2021 reported revenue (excluding sales to our core Nu Skin business).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Global Operations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, we generated approximately 20% of our revenue from the United States and approximately 21% from Mainland China. Given the size of our international operations, our results, as reported\n        in U.S. dollars, are often impacted by foreign-currency fluctuations; in 2021, our revenue was positively impacted 2% from foreign-currency fluctuations compared to 2020. In addition, our results can be impacted by global economic, political,\n        demographic and business trends and conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Global Network of Sales Leaders and Customers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 1,367,559 persons who purchased products directly from the company during the previous three months (\u201cCustomers\u201d). We believe a significant majority of Customers\n        purchase our products primarily for personal or family consumption but are not actively pursuing the opportunity to generate supplemental income by marketing and reselling products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur revenue is highly influenced by the number and productivity of our Sales Leaders. \u201cSales Leaders\u201d are our Brand Affiliates, and sales employees and independent marketers in Mainland China,\n        who achieve certain qualification requirements. Our Sales Leaders are also included in our Customer numbers, as they purchase products from the company and are within the definition of our \u201cCustomers.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have been successful in attracting and motivating our sales force by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\ndeveloping and marketing innovative, technologically and scientifically advanced products;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nproviding compelling initiatives and strong support; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\noffering an attractive sales compensation structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur global sales force helps us to rapidly introduce products and penetrate our markets with modest up-front promotional expense. We rely on our sales force to create consumer demand for our\n        products, as opposed to a traditional approach of advertising-generated consumer awareness. Our approach is particularly effective with products that benefit from personal education and demonstration. Similar to other companies in our industry, we\n        experience relatively high turnover among our sales force.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo enhance customer retention, we have developed product subscription and loyalty programs that provide incentives for consumers to commit to purchase a specific amount of product on a monthly\n        basis. All purchases under these programs are subject to our standard product payment and return policies. We believe these subscription and loyalty programs have improved consumer retention, have had a stabilizing impact on revenue and have helped\n        generate recurring sales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Innovation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur sales force markets and sells our products, and attracts others to the opportunity, based on the distinguishing benefits and innovative characteristics of our products. As a result, we\n        leverage our scientific expertise and product development resources to introduce innovative beauty, wellness and anti-aging products. Our sales force is increasingly using social media to market and sell our products. To continue to leverage social\n        media, it is imperative that we develop demonstrable products that are unique and engaging to younger consumers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny delays or difficulties in introducing compelling products or attractive initiatives or tools into our markets may have a negative impact on our revenue and our number of Customers and Sales\n        Leaders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Product Launch Process\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use a variety of methods to launch our products, enabling us to tailor the launch process to the specific market and the specific product. Prior to making a key product generally available for\n        purchase, we may do one or more introductory offerings of the product, such as a preview of the product to our Sales Leaders or other product introduction or promotion. These offerings may generate significant activity and a high level of\n        purchasing, which can result in a higher-than-normal increase in revenue during the quarter and can skew year-over-year and sequential comparisons. We believe our product launch process attracts new Customers and Sales Leaders to our business,\n        increases consumer trial and provides important marketing and forecasting information about the products to our company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeginning in the second half of 2021 and continuing into 2022, we are launching our \nBeauty Focus Collagen+\n skin care supplement and our \nageLOC Meta\n nutritional supplement that helps support metabolic health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome Statement Presentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe report revenue in ten segments, and we translate revenue from each market\u2019s local currency into U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates. Revenue is measured as the amount of\n        consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring products. All revenue is recognized when we satisfy our performance obligations under the contract. We recognize revenue by transferring the promised products to the customer, with\n        revenue recognized at shipping point, the point in time the customer obtains control of the products. We recognize revenue for shipping and handling charges at the time the products are delivered to or picked up by the customer. In most markets, we\n        offer a return policy that allows our sales force to return unopened and unused product for up to 12 months subject to a 10% restocking fee. Reported revenue is net of returns, which have historically been less than 5% of annual revenue. Sales\n        taxes and value added taxes in foreign jurisdictions that are collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from net sales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost of sales primarily consists of:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\ncost of products purchased from third-party vendors;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\ncosts of self-manufactured products;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\ncost of adjustments to inventory carrying value;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nfreight cost of shipping products to our sales force and import duties for the products; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nroyalties and related expenses for licensed technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor markets other than Mainland China, in 2021, we sourced most of our beauty products and wellness products from trusted third-party suppliers and manufacturers. In Mainland China, we operate\n      manufacturing facilities where we produce the majority of our beauty and wellness products sold in Mainland China. We also produce some products at these facilities that are exported to other markets. In the United States, we have beauty and wellness\n      manufacturing companies that sell to third-party vendors and are also producing some of our products. Cost of sales and gross profit, on a consolidated basis, may fluctuate as a result of changes in the ratio between self-manufactured products and\n      products sourced from third-party vendors. In addition, because we purchase a significant amount of our goods in U.S. dollars and recognize revenue in local currencies, our gross margin is subject to exchange rate risks. Because our gross margins\n      vary from product to product and due to higher pricing in some markets, changes in product mix and geographic revenue mix can impact our gross margin on a consolidated basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelling expenses are our most significant expense and are classified as operating expenses. Selling expenses include sales commissions paid to our sales force, special incentives, costs for\n        incentive trips and other rewards, as well as salaries, service fees, benefits, bonuses and other labor and unemployment expenses we pay to our sales force in Mainland China. Selling expenses do not include amounts we pay to our sales force based\n        on their personal purchases; rather, such amounts are reflected as reductions to revenue. Our global sales compensation plan, which we employ in all our markets except Mainland China, is an important factor in our ability to attract and retain our\n        Sales Leaders. Under our global sales compensation plan, Sales Leaders can earn \u201cmulti-level\u201d compensation, where they earn commissions for product sales to their consumer groups as well as the product sales made through the sales network they have\n        developed and trained. We do not pay commissions on sales materials. Fluctuations occur in the amount of commissions paid as our numbers of Customers and Sales Leaders change from month to month, but the fluctuation in the overall payout as a\n        percentage of revenue tends to be relatively small. Selling expenses as a percentage of revenue typically increase in connection with a significant product offering, due to growth in the number of Sales Leaders qualifying for increased sales\n        compensation and promotional incentives. From time to time, we make modifications and enhancements to our global sales compensation plan in an effort to help motivate our sales force and develop leadership characteristics, which can have an impact\n        on selling expenses. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we began to implement significant enhancements to our global sales compensation plan, which we have now rolled out across all markets other than Mainland China. One of the changes is\n        a new bonus program for our sales force, which has an increasing effect on our selling expenses as a percentage of revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutside of Mainland China, Brand Affiliates also have the opportunity to make profits by purchasing products from us at a discount and selling them to consumers with a mark-up. We do not account\n        for, nor pay, additional commissions on these mark-ups received by Brand Affiliates. In many markets, we also allow individuals who are not part of our sales force, whom we refer to as \u201cpreferred customers,\u201d to buy products directly from us at a\n        discount. We pay commissions on preferred customer purchases to the referring member of our sales force.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nwages and benefits;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nrents and utilities;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\ndepreciation and amortization;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\npromotion and advertising;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nprofessional fees;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\ntravel;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nresearch and development; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nother operating expenses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor expenses are the most significant portion of our general and administrative expenses. Promotion and advertising expenses include costs of sales force conventions held in various markets\n        worldwide, which we generally expense in the period in which they are incurred. Because our various sales force conventions are not held during each fiscal year, or in the same period each year, their impact on our general and administrative\n        expenses may vary from year to year and from quarter to quarter. For example, we held our global convention in October 2019 and will have another global convention in the fall of 2023, as we currently plan to hold a global convention every other\n        year. Our 2021 global convention was held virtually due to the ongoing pandemic. In addition, we hold regional conventions and conventions in our major markets at different times during the year. These conventions have significant expenses\n        associated with them. Because we have not incurred expenses for these conventions during every fiscal year or in comparable interim periods, year-over-year comparisons have been impacted accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvision for income taxes depends on the statutory tax rates and the withholding taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. For example, statutory tax rates in 2021 were\n        approximately 17% in Hong Kong, 20% in Taiwan, 25% in South Korea, 32% in Japan and 25% in Mainland China. We are subject to taxation in the United States at the statutory corporate federal tax rate of 21% in 2021, and we pay taxes in multiple\n        states within the United States at various tax rates. Our overall effective tax rate was 36.6% for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following critical accounting policies and estimates should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto. Management considers our\n        critical accounting policies to be accounting for income taxes and accounting for intangible assets. In each of these areas, management makes estimates based on historical results, current trends and future projections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome Taxes\n. We account for income taxes in accordance with the Income Taxes Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Codification\n. \nThis Topic\n        establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprise\u2019s activities during the current and preceding years. We take an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and\n        reporting of income taxes. We pay income taxes in many foreign jurisdictions based on the profits realized in those jurisdictions, which can be significantly impacted by terms of intercompany transactions between Nu Skin affiliates around the\n        world. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are created in this process. As of December 31, 2021, we had net deferred tax assets of $24.1 million. We net these deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities by jurisdiction. Valuation allowances\n        are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be ultimately realized. These deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings will exist for their realization, and are calculated using anticipated tax\n        rates. In certain jurisdictions, valuation allowances have been recorded against the deferred tax assets specifically related to use of foreign tax credits, research and development credits and net operating losses. When we determine that there is\n        sufficient taxable income to utilize the foreign tax credits, the research and development credits, or the net operating losses, the valuation allowances will be released. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all\n        or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe evaluate our indefinite reinvestment assertions with respect to foreign earnings for each period. Other than earnings we intend to reinvest indefinitely, we accrue for the U.S. federal and\n        state income taxes applicable to the earnings. For all foreign earnings, we accrue the applicable foreign income taxes. We intend to utilize the offshore earnings to fund foreign investments, specifically capital expenditures. Undistributed\n        earnings that we have indefinitely reinvested aggregate to $60.0 million as of December 31, 2021. If this amount were repatriated to the United States, the amount of incremental taxes would be approximately $6.0 million.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in various state and foreign jurisdictions. In 2009, we entered into a voluntary program with the IRS called Compliance Assurance\n        Process (\u201cCAP\u201d). Under the CAP program, the IRS audits the tax position of the Company to identify and resolve any tax issues that may arise throughout the tax year.\u00a0 As of December 31, 2021, tax years through 2020 have been audited and are\n        effectively closed to further examination. For tax years 2021 and 2022, the Company is in the Bridge phase of the CAP program, pursuant to which the IRS will not accept disclosures, will not conduct reviews and will not provide letters of assurance\n        for the Bridge years. There are limited circumstances that tax years in the Bridge phase will be opened for examination. With a few exceptions, we are no longer subject to state and local income tax examination by tax authorities for the years\n        before 2018. In major foreign jurisdictions, we are generally not subject to income tax examinations for years before 2015. However, statutes in certain markets may be as long as ten years for transfer pricing related issues. We are currently under\n        examination in certain foreign jurisdictions; however, the outcomes of those reviews are not yet determinable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur unrecognized tax benefits are related to multiple foreign and domestic jurisdictions. Due to potential changes in unrecognized tax benefits from the multiple jurisdictions in which we\n        operate, as well as the expiration of various statutes of limitation, it is reasonably possible that our gross unrecognized tax benefits, net of foreign currency adjustments, may increase within the next 12 months by a range of approximately $0.1\n        to $1.0 million.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we had $15.1 million in unrecognized tax benefits of which $15.1 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. In comparison, at December 31, 2020, we had\n        $17.6 million in unrecognized tax benefits of which $17.6 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. We recognized an increase of approximately $1.6 million in interest and penalties expense during the year ended December 31, 2021\n        and $1.5 million in interest and penalties during the year ended December 31, 2020. We had approximately $6.7 million, $5.1 million and $3.6 million of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2021, 2020 and\n        2019, respectively. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as a component of income tax expense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are subject to regular audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. These audits may result in additional tax liabilities. We account for such contingent liabilities in accordance\n        with relevant accounting standards and believe we have appropriately provided for income taxes for all years. Several factors drive the calculation of our tax reserves. Some of these factors include: (i) the expiration of various statutes of\n        limitations; (ii) changes in tax law and regulations; (iii) issuance of tax rulings; and (iv) settlements with tax authorities. Changes in any of these factors may result in adjustments to our reserves, which would impact our reported financial\n        results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntangible Assets\n. Acquired intangible assets may represent indefinite-lived assets, determinable-lived intangibles or goodwill. Of these, only the costs of determinable-lived intangibles\n        are amortized to expense over their estimated life. The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately\n        from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles. We test goodwill for impairment, at least annually, by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reportable unit level. We have the option to perform a qualitative\n        assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary or to perform a quantitative assessment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. Under the qualitative assessment, an entity\n        is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. If under the quantitative assessment the fair value of a reporting\n        unit is less than its carrying amount, then the amount of the impairment loss, if any, must be measured. We elected to perform the qualitative assessment for fiscal years 2021 and 2019. We used the quantitative assessment for fiscal year 2020.\n        Considerable management judgment is necessary to measure fair value. During 2021, we recognized an impairment charge associated with our exit of the Grow Tech segment. We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill or intangible assets\n        during 2020 and 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults of Operations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following table sets forth our operating results as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n 2021\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2019\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenue\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n100.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n100.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n100.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost of sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n25.0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n25.5\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n24.0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGross profit\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n75.0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n74.5\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n76.0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating expenses:\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelling expenses\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n39.6\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n39.5\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n39.5\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n24.7\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n25.0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n25.4\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestructuring and impairment expenses\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal operating expenses\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n66.3\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n64.5\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n64.9\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating income\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n8.7\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n10.0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n11.0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther income (expense), net\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(0.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(0.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome before provision for income taxes\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n8.6\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n9.9\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n10.5\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvision for income taxes\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3.1\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3.4\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n5.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n7.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n7.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2021 Compared to 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenue in 2021 increased 4% to $2.70 billion from $2.58 billion in 2020. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, Sales Leaders decreased 13% and Customers decreased 12% compared to the\n        prior year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur results benefited from continued growth in social commerce, along with strong product launches of \nBeauty Focus Collagen+ \nand \nageLOC\n          Meta, \nwhich combined generated approximately $119 million in revenue for 2021. The decline in Customers and Sales Leaders is primarily attributable to continued declines in our Mainland China business, ongoing COVID-related operational\n        disruptions in Southeast Asia and economical challenges in Latin America. The decline in Customers and Sales Leaders is consistent with our 10% decline in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to the same period in 2020. During the\n        second half of 2022, we currently plan to launch two connected, \u201cinput/output\u201d devices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarnings per share in 2021 decreased 21% to $2.86 from $3.63 in 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we adopted a restructuring program as we determined to exit our Grow Tech segment, resulting in charges totaling\n      $65.5 million. The impact of these charges was partially offset by increased revenue in 2021, lower weighted-average outstanding shares due to our stock repurchases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSegment Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe report our business in ten segments to reflect our current management approach.

Our Mainland China market continued to be challenged during 2021, as the COVID-19 delta and omicron variants and corresponding government restrictions negatively impacted our\n      selling and promotional activities. Our reported revenue benefited 6% from favorable foreign currency fluctuations. While we continue to invest in technology solutions to better support our social commerce business model in the Mainland China market,\n      we are anticipating the challenges will remain in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe year-over-year decrease in segment contribution primarily reflects lower revenue in 2021 and a 2.2 percentage point increase in selling expenses as a percentage of revenue. The salaries and\n        service fees of our Sales Leaders in Mainland China are fixed until they are adjusted in a quarterly evaluation process. As a result, we have variations in our selling expenses as percentage of revenue, particularly when there is a sequential\n        change in revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmericas\n. \nOur Americas segment continued to benefit from increased sharing of innovative products by our Brand Affiliates via the \nsocial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          commerce business model, which drove increased revenue in 2021. In addition, approximately $33 million of the increase in revenue is attributable to new product launches during 2021. The decline in Customers and Sales Leaders is predominately\n          attributable to the economic challenges being felt in our Latin America markets. The U.S. market, through strong social commerce adoption increased revenue 32% in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe year-over-year increase in segment contribution primarily reflects the increase in revenue in our U.S. market, which carries a more favorable gross margin than our Latin America markets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Korea\n. Our South Korea market grew 9% in 2021, as it benefited from successful product promotions and the fourth quarter launch of \nageLOC Meta, \nwhich\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        contributed $29 million in revenue.\u00a0 The 8% decline in Customers is primarily a result of the types of promotions we ran during the year, which focused more on increasing the number and productivity of our Sales Leaders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe year-over-year increase in segment contribution primarily reflects the increased revenue, along with the fixed nature of general and administrative expenses on increased revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoutheast Asia/Pacific\n. Our Southeast Asia/Pacific segment continued to be challenged by the COVID-19 outbreak and the associated government restrictions in 2021, which led to a decline in\n        revenue, Customers and Sales Leaders. We are experiencing slower adoption of our social commerce business in our Southeast Asia markets, which is also contributing to the decline in revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe year-over-year decrease in segment contribution for 2021 primarily reflects the decline in revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEMEA\n. The increase in revenue is primarily attributable to strong adoption by Brand Affiliates of the social commerce business model. In addition, approximately $17 million of the increase\n      in revenue is attributable to new product launches during 2021. Our reported revenue reflects a 5% benefit from favorable foreign-currency fluctuations. The decline in our\u00a0 Customers and Sales Leaders is primarily attributable to a strong first half\n      of 2021, followed by some softening of momentum attributable to the loosening of COVID-19 restrictions, which resulted in a prolonged summer vacation period. The softening of momentum also contributed to an 18% decline in revenue for the fourth\n      quarter of 2021, compared to the prior-year period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe year-over-year increase in segment contribution primarily reflects the increased revenue for 2021, along with a 2.0 percentage point increase in gross margin, attributable to a more favorable\n      product mix along with reduced air freight expense in 2021, and the fixed nature of general and administrative expenses on increased revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJapan\n. The decline in revenue is primarily attributable to unfavorable foreign-currency fluctuations. The decline in Customers and Sales Leaders is attributable to the ongoing COVID-19\n        outbreak, as our Japan market is more reliant on the in-person connections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe year-over-year decrease in segment contribution is primarily attributable to the decline in reported revenue, partially offset by a decline in general and administrative expenses from lower\n        labor expenses in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHong Kong/Taiwan\n. Our Hong Kong /Taiwan segment reported a 1% increase in revenue for 2021, with a 3% benefit from favorable foreign-currency fluctuations.\u00a0 Our Customers and Sales Leaders\n      decline is primarily attributable to the continued pressure from COVID-19 and a higher reliance on in-person business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe year-over-year increase in segment contribution is primarily attributable a 1.1 percentage point decrease in selling expenses and a $1.7 million decline in general and administrative expenses\n      from cost saving measures and lower labor expense for the year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManufacturing\n. Our Manufacturing segment generated a 15% increase in revenue for 2021.\u00a0 \nOur previous investments in additional capacity have allowed our manufacturing\n        companies to continue to increase revenue as the demand for nutrition and personal care products continues to expand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 13% decline in segment contribution primarily reflects a $4.8 million increase in inventory reserve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrow Tech\n. \n On December 22, 2021, we \ndetermined to exit our Grow Tech segment, which had been pursuing the commercialization of\n          controlled-environment agriculture technology for use in the agriculture feed industry. We believe this decision will help us to focus more resources on key strategic initiatives to achieve our future growth objectives and priorities in our core\n          business. We expect that the actions to wind down this segment\u2019s operations will be substantially completed during the first half of 2022. It is possible that certain contract terminations and legal matters might continue for additional time.\u00a0\n          During the fourth quarter of 2021, we recognized a $58.5 million pre-tax charge in connection with the exit, with $6.6 million recorded in cost of goods sold, associated with inventory write-off, $51.9 million in restructuring and impairment, and\n          a $6.4 million income tax charge. The segment contribution for 2021 includes the $58.5 million impact from the write-off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsolidated Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenue\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased 4% to $2.70 billion, compared to $2.58 billion in the prior-year period. For a discussion and analysis of this increase in revenue, see\n        \u201cOverview\u201d and \u201cSegment Results,\u201d above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGross profit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to 75.0% in 2021, compared to 74.5% in 2020. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue for core Nu Skin increased 1.2 percentage points\n        to 78.2%, reflecting lower freight cost as compared to 2020, when we needed to expedite more orders to meet a spike in demand.\n Our consolidated gross profit was negatively impacted $6.6 million from inventory write-off associated with our\n      fourth quarter 2021 restructuring and our increase in inventory reserve at our Manufacturing segment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelling expenses\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelling expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 39.6% in 2021,\u00a0 compared to 39.5% for 2020. Our core Nu Skin business\u2019s selling expense as a percentage of revenue increased 0.5\n        percentage points to 42.4% for 2021, compared to 41.9% for 2020. Selling expenses for our core Nu Skin business are driven by the specific performance of our individual Sales Leaders.\u00a0 Given the size of our sales force and the various components of\n        our compensation and incentive programs, selling expenses as a percentage of revenue typically fluctuate plus or minus approximately 100 basis points from period to period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased to $666.4 million in 2021, compared to $646.8 million in 2020. The $19.6 million increase \nprimarily relates to an increase in\n        IT expense, associated with our cloud transition and ongoing development of digital tools. \nAs a percentage of revenue, general and administrative decreased 0.3 percentage points to 24.7% for 2021, compared to\n          25.0% for 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestructuring and impairment expenses\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we adopted a restructuring program. We determined to exit our Grow Tech segment, as a strategic shift to better align our resources on key strategic initiatives to\n        achieve the future growth objectives and priorities of the core Nu Skin business. As a result of the restructuring program, we recorded $51.9 million in restructuring and impairment charges in 2021, consisting primarily of a non-cash charge of\n        $31.9 million for impairment of goodwill, intangibles and fixed assets, and $20.0 million of cash charges, including $6.5 million for employee severance and $13.5 million for other related cash charges associated with our restructuring. The\n        restructuring charges were recorded in the Grow Tech segment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther income (expense), net\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther income (expense), net for 2021 was $(1.5) million of expense, compared to $(1.3) million of expense in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvision for income taxes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvision for income taxes increased to $85.2 million in 2021 from $64.9 million in 2020. Our effective tax rate increased to 36.6% of pre-tax income in 2021 from 25.3% in 2020. \nThe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        increase in the effective tax rate for 2021 is primarily due to the disposal of the Grow Tech segment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor 2022, we currently anticipate that our effective tax rate will be approximately 24-30%. Our actual 2022 effective tax rate could differ materially from this estimate. Our future effective tax\n        rates could fluctuate significantly, being affected by numerous factors, such as intercompany transactions, changes in our business operations, foreign audits, increases in uncertain tax positions, acquisitions, entry into new markets, the amount\n        of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have a lower statutory rate and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have a higher statutory rate, losses incurred in jurisdictions, the\n        inability to realize tax benefits, withholding taxes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, net income in 2021 decreased to $147.3 million, compared to $191.4 million in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2020 Compared to 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a comparison of our operating results for 2020 compared to 2019, see Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations beginning on page 42 of our Annual Report on Form\n      10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC on February 11, 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, our principal uses of cash have included operating expenses (particularly selling expenses) and working capital (principally inventory purchases), as well as capital\n          expenditures, stock repurchases, dividends, debt repayment and the development of operations in new markets. We have at times incurred long-term debt, or drawn on our revolving line of credit, to fund strategic transactions, stock repurchases,\n          capital investments and short-term operating needs. We typically generate positive cash flow from operations due to favorable margins and have generally relied on cash from operations to fund operating activities. We generated $141.6 million in\n          cash from operations during 2021, compared to $379.1 million in cash from operations during 2020. \nThe decrease in cash flow from operations primarily reflects an increase in inventory partially attributable to our strategic decision to\n        carry more inventory to meet customer demand for our new products and build some protection from potential supply chain disruptions, along with the first quarter of 2021 payout of the accrued commission and accrued employee incentive payments\n        attributable to our growth in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents, including current investments, were $354.8 million compared to $423.9 million as of December 31, 2020. The decrease in cash and\n          cash equivalents primarily reflects the purchases of property and equipment, our quarterly dividend payments and repurchases of our stock, partially offset by our operating cash flow described above and our net borrowings under our revolving\n          credit facility during the year, which were primarily to fund our acquisitions, stock repurchases and other expenses for operations. Working capital as of December 31, 2021 was $343.3 million compared to $360.3 million as of December 31, 2020.\n          The decrease in working capital was primarily attributable \nto the decrease in cash and cash equivalents, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility during the year, partially offset by increased inventory and lower accrued\n        expenses, as discussed above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash requirements\n. For 2022, we currently expect that our material cash requirements will include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nCash requirements for operating activities. Our operating expenses typically total approximately 85%-90% of our revenue, with compensation to our sales force constituting 40%-42% of our core Nu Skin revenue.\u00a0\n                These compensation expenses consist primarily of commission payments, which we generally pay to our sales force within approximately one to two months of the sale. Inventory purchases have historically constituted approximately 15%-20% of\n                our revenue. On average, we purchase our inventory approximately three to six months prior to sale. While our actual cash usage may vary based on the timing of payments, we currently expect these approximate percentages and payment\n                practices to continue in 2022.\u00a0 In addition, we expect our 2022 lease payments will be approximately $38 million.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nCash requirements for investing activities. As discussed in more detail below, our capital expenditures are expected to be $85-105 million for 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nCash requirements for financing activities. In 2022 we are obligated to make a total of $37.5 million in quarterly principal payments plus the associated interest on our term loan. We also anticipate paying\n                quarterly cash dividends throughout 2022, approximating $19-20 million per quarter depending on the number of shares outstanding as of record date. Additional details about our dividends and term loan are provided below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor 2023 and onward, we currently expect the above material cash requirements will remain.\u00a0 See Note 6 and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report for our future\n        cash requirements related to our debt principal repayment and our maturities of lease liabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe intend to fund the aforementioned cash requirements with our cash from operations and draw on our revolving credit facility, as needed, to address any short-term funding requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapital expenditures\n. Capital expenditures in 2021 totaled $68.6 million. As with 2021, we expect that the capital expenditures in 2022 will be primarily related to:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\npurchases and expenditures for computer systems and equipment, software, and application development; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\nthe expansion and upgrade of facilities in our various markets; and \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u25cf\n\n\n\n\na new manufacturing plant in Mainland China.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe estimate that capital expenditures for the uses listed above will total approximately $85\u2013105 million for 2022. We are currently in the building phase of the new manufacturing plant in\n        Mainland China. We have spent approximately $37.3 million on this project through the end of 2021, and expect that our capital expenditures for this project will total approximately $52-57 million, including $15-20 million during 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit agreement\n. In April 2018, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with various financial institutions as lenders and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent. The Credit\n      Agreement provides for a $400.0 million term loan facility and a $350.0 million revolving credit facility, each with a term of five years. We used the proceeds of the term loan and the draw on the revolving facility to pay off our previous credit\n      agreement and the outstanding balance on our 2016 convertible notes that were converted at the election of the holder in the first quarter of 2018. The interest rate applicable to the facilities is subject to adjustments based on our consolidated\n      leverage ratio. The term loan facility amortizes in quarterly installments in amounts resulting in an annual amortization of 5.0% during the first and second years, 7.5% during the third and fourth years and 10.0% during the fifth year after the\n      closing date of the Credit Agreement, with the remainder payable at final maturity. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, $70.0 million and no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and $307.5 million and $337.5 million remaining\n      balance on our term loan facility. The carrying value of the debt also reflects debt issuance costs of $1.2 million and $2.1 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to the Credit Agreement.\u00a0 The Credit Agreement requires us to\n      maintain a consolidated leverage ratio not exceeding 2.25 to 1.00 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio of no less than 3.00 to 1.00. We are currently in compliance with all debt covenants under the Credit Agreement.\u00a0 We are planning to\n      refinance our Credit Agreement during the first half of 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerivative instruments\n. As of December 31, 2021, we had four interest rate swaps, with a total notional principal amount of $200 million and a maturity date of July 31, 2025. We entered into these interest rate\n      swap arrangements during the third quarter of 2020 to hedge the variable cash flows associated with our variable-rate debt under the Credit Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock repurchase plan\n. In 2018, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase plan authorizing us to repurchase up to $500.0 million of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock on\n      the open market or in private transactions. During 2021, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares of our Class A common stock under the plan for $80.4 million. As of December 31, 2021, $245.4 million was available for repurchases under the\n      plan. Our stock repurchases are used primarily to offset dilution from our equity incentive plans and for strategic initiatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n51\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDividends\n. We paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.38 per share\n in March, June, September and December of 2021, for a total of $19.3 million, $19.0 million, $19.0 million\n      and $18.9 million, respectively. In February 2022, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.385 per share to be paid on March 9, 2022 to stockholders of record on February 28, 2022. Currently, we anticipate that our board of\n      directors will continue to declare quarterly cash dividends and that the cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our future dividend payments. However, the continued declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of\n      directors and will depend upon various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other relevant factors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash from foreign subsidiaries\n. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we held $354.8 million and $423.9 million, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents, including current investments.\n        These amounts include $274.9 million and $374.7 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, held in our operations outside of the United States. Substantially all of our non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents are readily convertible into\n        U.S. dollars or other currencies, subject to procedural or other requirements in certain markets, as well as an indefinite-reinvestment designation, as described below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe typically fund the cash requirements of our operations in the United States through intercompany dividends, intercompany loans and intercompany charges for products, use of\n          intangible property, and corporate services. However, some markets impose government-approval or other requirements for the repatriation of dividends. For example, in Mainland China, we are unable to repatriate cash from current operations in the\n          form of dividends until we file the necessary statutory financial statements for the relevant period. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had $50.3 million and $103.0 million, respectively, in cash denominated in Chinese RMB. \nWe also\n        have experienced delays in repatriating cash from Argentina. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had $11.3 million and $10.6 million, respectively, in intercompany receivable with our Argentina subsidiary. \nWe\n          also have intercompany loan arrangements with some of our markets, including Mainland China, that allow us to access available cash, subject to certain limits in Mainland China and other jurisdictions. We also have drawn on our revolving line of\n          credit to address cash needs until we can repatriate cash from Mainland China or other markets, and we may continue to do so. Except for $60 million of earnings in Mainland China that we designated as indefinitely reinvested during the second\n          quarter of 2018, we currently plan to repatriate undistributed earnings from our non-U.S. operations as necessary, considering the cash needs of our non-U.S. operations and the cash needs of our U.S. operations for dividends, stock repurchases,\n          capital investments, debt repayment and strategic transactions. Repatriation of non-U.S. earnings is subject to withholding taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, we have accrued the necessary withholding taxes related to the\n          non-U.S. earnings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe currently believe that existing cash balances, future cash flows from operations and existing lines of credit will be adequate to fund our cash needs on both a short- and long-term basis. The\n        majority of our historical expenses have been variable in nature and as such, a potential reduction in the level of revenue would reduce our cash flow needs. In the event that our current cash balances, future cash flow from operations and current\n        lines of credit are not sufficient to meet our obligations or strategic needs, we would consider raising additional funds in the debt or equity markets or restructuring our current debt obligations. Additionally, we would consider realigning our\n        strategic plans, including a reduction in capital spending, stock repurchases or dividend payments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstant-currency revenue change is a non-GAAP financial measure that removes the impact of fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the Company\u2019s\n      performance. It is calculated by translating the current period\u2019s revenue at the same average exchange rates in effect during the applicable prior-year period and then comparing that amount to the prior-year period\u2019s revenue.\u00a0 We believe that\n      constant-currency revenue change is useful to investors, lenders, and analysts because such information enables them to gauge the impact of foreign-currency fluctuations on our revenue from period to period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContingent Liabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease refer to Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report for information regarding our contingent liabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeasonality and Cyclicality\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to general economic factors, we are impacted by seasonal factors and trends such as major cultural events and vacation patterns. For example, most Asian markets celebrate their\n        respective local New Year in the first quarter, which generally has a negative impact on that quarter. We believe that direct selling is also generally negatively impacted during the third quarter, when many individuals, including our sales force,\n        traditionally take vacations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior to making a key product generally available for purchase, we often do one or more introductory offerings of the product, such as a preview of the product to our Sales Leaders or other\n        product introduction or promotion. These offerings may generate significant activity and a high level of purchasing, which can result in a higher-than-normal increase in revenue, Sales Leaders and/or Customers during the quarter and can skew\n        year-over-year and sequential comparisons.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n52\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA description of new accounting pronouncements is contained in Note 2 to consolidated financial statements contained in this report..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "item7a": ">ITEM 7A.\n\n    \n\n\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrency Risk and Exchange Rate Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA majority of our revenue and many of our expenses are recognized outside of the United States, except for inventory purchases, a significant portion of which are primarily transacted in U.S.\n        dollars from vendors in the United States. The local currency of each of our Subsidiaries\u2019 primary markets is considered the functional currency with the exception of our Asia product-distribution subsidiary in Singapore and, as discussed below,\n        our subsidiary in Argentina. All revenue and expenses are translated at weighted-average exchange rates for the periods reported. Therefore, our reported revenue and earnings will be positively impacted by a weakening of the U.S. dollar and will be\n        negatively impacted by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar. These impacts may be significant because a large portion of our business is derived from outside of the United States. Given the uncertainty of exchange rate fluctuations, it is difficult\n        to predict the effect of these fluctuations on our future business, product pricing and results of operations or financial condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the second quarter of 2018, published inflation indices indicated that the three-year cumulative inflation in Argentina exceeded 100%, and as of July 1, 2018, we elected to adopt highly\n        inflationary accounting for our subsidiary in Argentina. Under highly inflationary accounting, Argentina\u2019s functional currency became the U.S. dollar, and its income statement and balance sheet have been measured in U.S. dollars using both current\n        and historical rates of exchange. The effect of changes in exchange rates on peso-denominated monetary assets and liabilities has been reflected in earnings in Other income (expense), net and was not material. As of December 31, 2021, our Argentina\n        subsidiary had a small net peso monetary position. Net sales of Argentina were less than 2% of our consolidated net sales for 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe may seek to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates through the use of foreign currency exchange contracts and through intercompany loans of foreign currency. We\n        do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We regularly monitor our foreign currency risks and periodically take measures to reduce the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our operating results. As of\n        December 31, 2021, and 2020, we did not hold non-designated mark-to-market forward derivative contracts to hedge foreign-denominated intercompany positions or third-party foreign debt. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we did not hold any forward\n        contracts designated as foreign-currency cash flow hedges.\u00a0 We continue to evaluate our foreign currency hedging policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing are the weighted-average currency exchange rates of U.S. $1 into local currency for each of our international or foreign markets in which revenue exceeded U.S. $5.0

2021, we had $376.3 million outstanding on the term loan, net of unamortized debt issuance cost and outstanding borrowings\n      on our revolving credit facility.\u00a0 Our four interest rate swaps reduce our exposure to interest rate risk on our term loan by $200.0 million as of December 31, 2021.\u00a0 As a result, the total variable debt of $176.3 million was exposed to market risks\n      as of December 31, 2021. A hypothetical one percentage point increase (decrease) in interest rates on our variable rate debt would increase (decrease) our annual interest expense by approximately $1.8 million.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor variable rate debt, interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair value of the debt instrument, but do impact future earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant. We have not entered\n      into and currently do not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLIBOR is used as a reference rate for our term loan, revolving credit facility and our interest rate swap agreements we use to hedge our interest rate exposure. In 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority announced that\n      it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021, and it is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established. Our Credit Agreement includes a provision related to the potential\n      discontinuance of LIBOR to be replaced with one or more Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) values or another alternate benchmark rate. However, if LIBOR ceases to exist after 2021, the interest rates under the alternative rate could be higher\n      than LIBOR. In addition, the value of derivative instruments tied to LIBOR could also be impacted if LIBOR is limited or discontinued. We continue to review the impact the LIBOR phase-out will have on the Company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor additional information about our market risk see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n54\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "companyName": "Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc.", "cusip": "G6683N103"}
