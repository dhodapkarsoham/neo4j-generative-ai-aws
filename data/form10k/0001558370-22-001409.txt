{"item1": ">Item\u00a01.Business\nOverview\nSun Country Airlines is a new breed of hybrid low-cost air carrier that dynamically deploys shared resources across our synergistic scheduled service, charter, and cargo businesses. By doing so, we believe we are able to generate high growth, high margins and strong cash flows with greater resilience than other passenger airlines. We focus on serving leisure and VFR passengers and charter customers and providing CMI service to Amazon, with flights throughout the United States and to destinations in Canada, Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. Based in Minnesota, we operate an agile network that includes our scheduled service business and our synergistic charter and cargo businesses. We share resources, such as flight crews, across our scheduled service, charter and cargo business lines with the objective of generating higher returns and margins and mitigating the seasonality of our route network. We optimize capacity allocation by market, time of year, day of week and line of business by shifting flying to markets during periods of peak demand and away from markets during periods of low demand with far greater frequency than nearly all other large U.S. passenger airlines. We believe our flexible business model generates higher returns and margins while also providing greater resiliency to economic and industry downturns than a traditional scheduled service carrier.\nOur Unique Business Model\nScheduled Service.\n\u2003Our scheduled service business combines low costs with a high quality product to generate higher TRASM than ULCCs while maintaining lower Adjusted CASM than LCCs, resulting in best-in-class unit profitability. Our scheduled service business includes many cost characteristics of ultra low-cost carriers, or ULCCs (which include Allegiant Travel Company, Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines), such as an unbundled product (which means we offer a base fare and allow customers to purchase ancillary products and services for an additional fee), and point-to-point service. We fly a single-family fleet of Boeing 737-NG aircraft, which allows us to maintain a cost base comparable to these ULCCs. However, we offer a high quality product that we believe is superior to ULCCs and consistent with that of low-cost carriers, or LCCs (which include Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways). Our product includes generous legroom, complimentary beverages, in-flight entertainment, and in-seat power. The combination of our agile peak demand network with our elevated consumer product allows us to generate higher TRASM than ULCCs while maintaining lower Adjusted CASM than LCCs. In addition, as a low cost, leisure focused carrier, rather than a business travel focused carrier, we believe we are one of the early beneficiaries of the industry rebound following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n12\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCharter\n.\u2003Our charter business, which is one of the largest narrow body charter operations in the United States, is a key component of our strategy both because it provides inherent diversification and downside demand protection (it is uncorrelated to our scheduled service, as evidenced by the fact that it recovered faster than our scheduled service business during the COVID-19 pandemic) as well as because it is synergistic with our other businesses (for example, we can dynamically deploy aircraft and pilots to their most profitable uses whether they are in charter or scheduled service). Our charter business has several favorable characteristics, including large repeat customers, more stable demand than scheduled service flying and the ability to pass through certain costs, including fuel. Our diverse charter customer base includes casino operators, the U.S. Department of Defense, college sports teams and professional sports teams. In October 2021, we signed a five-year agreement to provide charter service to all Major League Soccer (MLS) teams. Major League Soccer features 28 clubs throughout the United States and Canada, in addition to a future expansion team in St. Louis, MO. We are the leading charter airline for college sports including the National Collegiate Athletic Association (\u201cNCAA\u201d) Championships (notably \u201cMarch Madness\u201d) as well as individual team travel. Additionally, we signed a new five-year agreement, effective March 2022 to provide charter service to Caesars Entertainment, Inc. This agreement restarts a relationship between the two organizations that ended in late 2020. The agreement calls for two aircraft to provide charter service for Caesars Entertainment guests to Atlantic City, New Jersey, Reno, Nevada, Laughlin, Nevada and Gulfport, Mississippi. Our charter business includes ad hoc, repeat, short-term and long-term service contracts with pass-through fuel arrangements and annual rate escalations. Most of our business is non-cyclical because the U.S. Department of Defense and sports teams still fly during normal economic downturns, and our casino contracts are long-term in nature.\nOur charter business has proven to be more resilient than our scheduled service business during the COVID-19 induced downturn. Additionally, our charter business complements our seasonal and day-of-week focused scheduled passenger service by allowing us to optimally schedule our aircraft and crews to the most profitable flying opportunities. In general, charter ASMs are highest in fall\u00a0months when scheduled service operations are less favorable. In addition, certain costs may be passed directly to the customer. Fuel expense is typically incurred by us; however, revenue rates under our charter contracts are often adjusted for final fuel prices incurred, effectively shifting fuel price risk away from us.\nCargo\n.\n\u2003On December\u00a013, 2019, we signed the ATSA with Amazon to provide air cargo services. Flying under the ATSA began in May\u00a02020 and, as of December\u00a031, 2021, we are flying 12 Boeing 737-800 cargo aircraft for Amazon (having been awarded two additional aircraft in October\u00a0and November\u00a02020 after the initial contract for 10 aircraft). Our CMI service is asset-light from a Sun Country perspective, as Amazon supplies the aircraft and covers many of the operating expenses, including fuel, and provides all cargo loading and unloading services. We are responsible for flying the aircraft under our air carrier certificate, crew, aircraft line maintenance and insurance, all of which allow us to leverage our existing operational expertise from our scheduled service and charter businesses. The ATSA has generated consistent, positive cash flows through the COVID-19 induced downturn. The ATSA offers potential future growth opportunities by establishing a long-term partnership with Amazon. Our cargo business also enables us to leverage certain assets, capabilities and fixed costs to enhance profitability and promote growth across our company. For example, we believe that by deploying pilots across each of our business lines, we increase the efficiency of our operations.\nThe ATSA is a six-year contract and includes two, two-year extensions exercisable at Amazon\u2019s option, providing for a total term of ten\u00a0years if both extension options are exercised. The option to renew the ATSA for two additional two-year terms is at Amazon\u2019s sole discretion, subject to Amazon providing Sun Country with at least 180\u00a0days\u2019 prior written notice before the expiration of the then-current term. The ATSA has annual rate escalations, so rate increases occurred on December\u00a013, 2021 and 2020.\nOur Transformation\nIn April\u00a02018, Sun Country Airlines was acquired by the Apollo Funds. Since the acquisition, our business has been transformed under a new management team of seasoned professionals who have a strong combination of low-cost and legacy network airline experience.\n13\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u25cf\nWe redesigned our network to focus on flying leisure customers during peak demand opportunities by concentrating scheduled service trips during the highest yielding\u00a0months of the\u00a0year and\u00a0days of the week and allocating aircraft to our charter service when it is more profitable to do so.\n\u25cf\nWe invested in capital projects that included modernizing the cabin experience with new seats, in-seat power and in-flight entertainment. Our investments also facilitated a transition to owning our fleet, rather than leasing, to reduce costs. We implemented a new booking engine, \nNavitaire\n, rebranded our product along with our website and invested in improving the customer support experience. We consolidated our corporate headquarters into an on-airport hangar in 2019.\n\u25cf\nWe greatly expanded our ancillary products and services, which consist of baggage fees, seat assignment fees and other fees.\n\u25cf\nWe launched and grew our asset light cargo business and fully integrated our pilot labor group across our scheduled service, charter, and cargo businesses.\n\u25cf\nWe reduced unit costs with several initiatives, including: renegotiating certain key contracts and agreements; increasing the portion of bookings made directly through our website; reducing the cost of our fleet through more efficient aircraft sourcing and financing; staffing efficiencies; and other cost-saving initiatives.\nWhile the COVID-19 induced industry downturn impeded our growth in 2020 and 2021, we believe that these investments have positioned us to profitably grow our business in the long term.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn March 19, 2021, we completed our initial public offering, in which we issued and sold 10,454,545 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $24.00 per share. We received net proceeds of $225,329 from sales of shares in the initial public offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, and other offering expenses. We used $46,260 of the net proceeds from the initial public offering to repay all amounts outstanding under the CARES Act Loan. The remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including to acquire additional aircraft.\nCOVID-19 Induced Downturn\nAll major U.S. passenger airlines were negatively impacted by the declining demand environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. We have also experienced a significant decline in demand related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused a material decline in our revenues and negatively impacted our financial condition and operating results, which is likely to continue for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and our business operations were adjusted in response to the pandemic as described below. However, we believe that our diversified and flexible business model allowed us to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our business in 2020 and 2021 better than any other mainline U.S. passenger airline (which we consider to be the 11 largest U.S. mainline passenger carriers based on ASMs) based on adjusted pre-tax and adjusted operating income margins. We believe this result was due to our flexible business model, allowing us to shift resources to our charter and cargo businesses and away from our scheduled service business during periods of low leisure passenger demand. Other airlines have different business models than ours, and a comparison of pre-tax and operating income margins among airlines during normal industry conditions may have a different result.\n14\n\n\nTable of Contents\nActions we took during 2020 to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 induced downturn preserved more than $152,074 in liquidity and included: capacity reductions; a company-wide hiring freeze; headcount reductions; voluntary leave programs; reduced advertising expenditures; reduced capital expenditures; and deferred vendor payments. In February 2021, we executed a five-year credit agreement with a group of lenders that provides for a $25,000 Revolving Credit Facility and a $90,000 Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility (collectively, the \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d). Further, we have received grants from Treasury through the Payroll Support Program and accepted the CARES Act Loan from the Treasury through the CARES Act Loan Program, which was repaid in full on March 24, 2021, without issuing any warrants, unlike nearly all other carriers with whom we compete that received government assistance. We have also maintained our pre-COVID-19 corporate credit ratings throughout this downturn. COVID-19 vaccines have become widely available in the United States and a majority of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated according to the CDC. As vaccines became more widely distributed in 2021, the airline industry continued to rebound in 2021 and we believe will normalize in 2022. Given our focus on low-cost domestic leisure travel, we believe we are rebounding faster than most other U.S. airlines.\nOur financial and operating results and business operations for our scheduled service and charter businesses for the\u00a0years ended December\u00a031, 2020 and 2021 were materially and adversely impacted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which impact is likely to continue during the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that our financial and operating results for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019 are more useful indicators of our scheduled service and charter service operating performance during normal industry conditions. See \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nOur Competitive Strengths\nWe believe that the following key strengths allow us to compete successfully within the U.S. airline industry.\nDiversified and Resilient Business Model.\n\u2003Our diversified business model, which includes a focus on leisure and VFR passengers, charter and e-commerce related cargo service, is unique in the airline sector and mitigates the impact of economic and industry downturns on our business when compared with other large U.S. passenger airlines. Our charter business has rebounded quicker than our scheduled service business as customers such as the DoD and large university sports teams continued to fly in 2020 and 2021, while our casino customers are subject to long-term contracts and began flying again in June\u00a02020. Our cargo business exhibited steady growth in 2020 and 2021 as flying ramped up and demand remained strong, driven by underlying secular growth in e-commerce.\n15\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAgile Peak Demand Scheduling Strategy.\n\u2003We flex our capacity by day of the week,\u00a0month of the\u00a0year and line of business to capture what we believe are the most profitable flying opportunities available from both our MSP home market and our network of non-MSP markets. As a result, our route network varies widely throughout the\u00a0year. For the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019, the most recent normalized full\u00a0year before the COVID-19 pandemic, we flew approximately 38% of our ASMs during our top 100 peak demand\u00a0days of the\u00a0year as compared to 15% of our ASMs during our bottom 100 demand\u00a0days of the\u00a0year. For 2019, our average fare was approximately 29% higher on our top 100 peak demand\u00a0days as compared to the remaining\u00a0days of the\u00a0year. In 2019, only 3% of our routes were daily\u00a0year-round, compared to 67% for Southwest Airlines, 42% for Spirit Airlines, 8% for Frontier Airlines and 2% for Allegiant Travel Company. Our agile peak demand strategy allows us to generate higher TRASM by focusing on\u00a0days with stronger demand. Our flexible network has also benefitted us in 2020 and 2021 during the COVID-19 induced industry downturn where we have been able to quickly shift capacity from low demand markets to high demand markets within the United States as COVID-19 infection rates shifted across regions of the country. Our flying continued to be more seasonal in 2021 with our scheduled service from July\u00a02021 through April\u00a02022 containing only 1% daily\u00a0year-round routes. The following charts demonstrate that our schedule is highly variable by day of the week and\u00a0month of the\u00a0year.\n\u200b\nIn addition to shifting aircraft across our network by season and day of week, we also shift aircraft between our scheduled service and charter businesses to maximize the return on our assets. We regularly schedule our fleet using what we refer to as \u201c\nPower Patterns\n,\u201d which involves scheduling aircraft and crew on trips that combine scheduled service and charter legs, dynamically replacing what would be lower margin scheduled service flights with charter opportunities. Our agility is supported by our variable cost structure and the cross utilization of our people and assets between our lines of business. Our synergies from cross utilization have increased since we began providing CMI services because our pilots are interchangeably deployed between scheduled service, charter and cargo flights. For example, when demand in our scheduled service business declined in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 induced industry downturn, we allocated more pilot flying hours to our charter and cargo businesses.\n16\n\n\nTable of Contents\nTactical Mid-Life Fleet with Flexible Operations\n.\u2003We maintain low aircraft ownership costs by acquiring mid-life Boeing 737-800 aircraft, which have lower acquisition costs when compared to new Boeing 737 aircraft, that more than offsets their higher ongoing maintenance and repair costs. Lower ownership costs allow us to maintain lower unit costs at lower levels of utilization. This allows us to concentrate our flying during periods of peak demand, which generates higher TRASM and also allows us to park aircraft during periods of low demand, at a lower cost than other airlines. In 2019, we flew our aircraft an average of 9.6 hours per day, which is the lowest among major U.S. airlines, other than Allegiant Travel Company, which operates a similar low utilization model but serves smaller markets. In addition to the benefits of lower all-in ownership costs, we do not have an aircraft order book because we only purchase mid-life aircraft. As a result, unlike many other airlines, we are not locked into large future capital expenditures. Rather, we have the ability to opportunistically take advantage of aircraft prices with purchases at the time of our choosing. Our single family aircraft fleet also has operational and cost advantages, such as allowing for optimization of crew scheduling and training and lower maintenance costs. Our fleet is highly reliable, and we have a demonstrated ability to maintain our high completion factor during harsh weather conditions. For the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019, we had a completion factor of 99.8% across our system. We improved this already leading completion factor to 99.9% in both 2020 and 2021.\nSuperior Low-Cost Product and Brand\n.\u2003We have invested in numerous projects to create a well-regarded product and brand that we believe is superior to ULCCs while maintaining lower fares than LCCs and larger full service carriers. Some of the reasons that we believe we have a superior brand to ULCCs include:\n\u25cf\nOur Cabin Experience.\n\u2003All of our 737-800 aircraft have new state-of-the-art seats that comfortably recline and have full size tray tables. Our seats have an average pitch of approximately 31 inches, giving our customers comparable legroom to Southwest Airlines and greater legroom than all ULCCs in the United States. We also provide seat-back power, complimentary in-flight entertainment and free beverages to improve the overall flying experience for our customers.\n\u25cf\nOur Digital Experience.\n\u2003We have significantly improved the buying experience for our customers. We overhauled our passenger service system in 2019 and transitioned to \nNavitaire\n, the premier passenger service system in the United States. \nNavitaire\n has decreased our overall website session length, decreased the\u00a0percentage of failures to complete a transaction after accessing our website on a mobile device and increased the\u00a0percentage of visits to our website that result in an airfare purchase. The transition to \nNavitaire\n has been one of the most important initiatives in improving the Sun Country customer experience, making our website booking for flights more seamless, allowing us to create a large customer database and supporting ancillary revenue growth. Beyond \nNavitaire\n, we have improved the check-in experience for customers by providing access to web-check in across the system and access to kiosks in our main hub location of MSP. In 2021, 78% of our Minneapolis originating scheduled service passengers have checked in either online or at a kiosk compared to 73% in 2020. System wide over 77% of our scheduled service passengers in 2021 have checked in electronically compared to 68% in 2020. These tools increase the chances that the passenger can skip the check-in counter, which we believe improves our customers\u2019 experience while also reducing costs.\nCompetitive Low Cost Structure.\n\u2003Our CASM declined from 10.09\u00a0cents for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2017 to 8.82\u00a0cents for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019. Our Adjusted CASM declined from 7.80\u00a0cents for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2017 to 6.31\u00a0cents for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019. Our completed and ongoing cost savings efforts include conversion to a focus on owning (versus leasing) aircraft, renegotiation of our component maintenance agreement, fuel savings initiatives, catering cost reductions, renegotiation of distribution contracts, consolidation of staff at headquarters on airport property and various other initiatives. Our CASM and Adjusted CASM for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020 of 8.91\u00a0cents and 7.57\u00a0cents and for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2021 of 8.86 cents and 6.44 cents, respectively, were adversely impacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While Adjusted CASM for all U.S. airlines increased in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 induced downturn, we believe that our business model and strategy positions us well to maintain and improve our Adjusted CASM in the future, while maintaining lower utilization rates than many other U.S. passenger airlines.\n17\n\n\nTable of Contents\nStrong Position in Our Profitable MSP Home Market.\n\u2003We have been based in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area since our founding over 35 years ago, where our brand is well-known and well-liked. We are the largest low-cost carrier operating at MSP, which is our largest base, and the second largest airline at MSP after Delta Air Lines. \u00a0Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic we have been focused on developing our network at MSP and have grown our nonstop destinations from MSP by over 40% since 2019. \u00a0Moreover, we have seen our share of MSP-origin customers improving through the COVID pandemic. \u00a0We fly out of Terminal 2, which we believe is preferred by many flyers because of its smaller layout, shorter security wait times, close parking relative to check-in and full suite of retail shops. As of December 31, 2021, we utilized 8 of the 14 gates in Terminal 2. As a result of our focus on flying during seasonal peak periods, our well regarded brand and product and our strong position in Minneapolis, we have historically enjoyed a TRASM premium to other leisure airlines at MSP.\nSeasoned Management Team.\n\u2003Our Chief Executive Officer, Jude Bricker, joined Sun Country Airlines in July\u00a02017 and has over 17\u00a0years of experience in the aviation industry, including serving as the Chief Operating Officer of Allegiant Travel Company from 2016 to 2017. Our President and Chief Financial Officer, Dave Davis, joined Sun Country in April\u00a02018 and has over 23\u00a0years of experience in the aviation industry, including previously serving as the Chief Financial Officer at Northwest Airlines and US Airways. Other members of our management team have worked at airlines such as Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines, United Airlines and US Airways.\nOur Growth Strategy\nSince 2018, we have established the infrastructure to support our significant long-term profitable growth strategy.\n\u25cf\nNetwork\n.\u2003We launched 64 new markets from 2018 through 2019 and developed a repeatable network growth strategy. During 2021, we announced 34 new markets. Our network strategy is expected to support passenger fleet growth to approximately 50 aircraft by the end of 2023.\n\u25cf\nFleet\n.\u2003We restructured our fleet with a focus on ownership of Boeing 737-800s, allowing us to focus on growth with low capital commitments. We believe the current dislocation in the aircraft market will enable us to access aircraft at an attractive cost relative to our peers.\n\u25cf\nCustomer\n.\u2003We rebranded the airline around a leisure product with a significant ancillary revenue component which we believe allowed us to stimulate demand during the rebound from COVID-19 earlier than airlines focused on business travelers.\n\u25cf\nCulture\n.\u2003We installed a new management team with a cost-conscious ethos, which included moving our headquarters into a hangar at MSP.\n\u25cf\nOperations\n.\u2003We maintained high standards of operational performance, including a 99.8% completion factor for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019. We improved this already leading completion factor to 99.9% in both 2020 and 2021.\nWe believe our initiatives have provided us with a platform to profitably grow our business. Key elements of our growth strategy include:\nLeverage the Expected Rebound in Our Passenger Business.\n\u2003The number of domestic LCC and ULCC passenger enplanements grew at a compound annual growth rate of 7% from 2014 to 2019 due to long-term increasing demand for air travel in the United States. Following the spread of COVID-19 in the United States, passenger levels declined. Our scheduled service business is rebounding as the COVID-19 pandemic matures, particularly with the uptake of vaccines. We believe we are among the early beneficiaries of this rebound given our peak demand strategy and focus on leisure and VFR travelers, who are gradually returning to pre-COVID-19 levels. In previous economic downturns, leisure and VFR travelers have also been the first to return to flying at normalized levels.\n18\n\n\nTable of Contents\nGrow Our Cargo Business.\n\u2003In December\u00a02019, we signed the ATSA with Amazon to provide air cargo transportation services flying 10 aircraft with agreed upon pricing. Since that time, Amazon requested, and we agreed to fly, two additional aircraft to bring the total number of aircraft we are flying for Amazon to 12 as of December\u00a031, 2021. We believe we are well-positioned to continue growing our cargo business over time, while continuing to operate for Amazon and potentially new customers.\nExpand our Peak Demand Flying in Minneapolis and Beyond.\n\u2003Following a rebound in U.S. air travel, we intend to continue growing our network profitably both from MSP and on new routes outside of MSP by focusing on seasonal markets and day-of-the-week flying during periods of peak demand. We expanded our network from 46 routes in 2017 to 98 as of the end of 2019, including expanding our routes that neither originate nor terminate in MSP from 5 routes in 2017 to 42 as of the end of 2019. At the end of 2020 and 2021, we flew 114 and 127 network routes, respectively. These 2020 and 2021 network routes included 31 and 30 routes, respectively, that neither originated nor terminated in MSP. We have identified a significant number of additional new market opportunities, both in MSP and outside of MSP, that we expect to be profitable and allow us to grow our agile, peak-demand focused scheduled service network strategy. We have a successful history of opening and closing stations quickly to meet seasonal demand, which we believe will benefit us in re-opening markets we closed during the COVID-19 downturn and in pursuing new market growth opportunities quickly. Our future network plans include growing our network at our hub in Minneapolis to full potential, including adding frequencies on routes we already serve and adding new routes to leverage our large, loyal customer base in the area. Our long-term strategic plans have identified growth opportunities at MSP that we believe represent significant scheduled service capacity growth opportunities.\nWe had also been rapidly growing outside of MSP prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect to do so again once the air travel market rebounds. Our customer-friendly low fares have been well received in the upper Midwest and in large, fragmented markets elsewhere that we can profitably serve on a seasonal and/or day-of-week basis. Our upper Midwest growth is focused on cold to warm weather leisure routes from markets similar to Minneapolis, such as Madison, Wisconsin. Additionally, we have added capacity on large leisure trunk routes on a seasonal basis during periods when demand is high. Examples of such routes include Los Angeles to Honolulu and Texas to Mexican beach destinations during the summer\u00a0months. Our business model is ideally suited to seasonally serve these routes, which are highly profitable in normal environments because fares are elevated during the\u00a0months in which we fly them. Our long-term strategic plans have identified non-MSP growth opportunities that we believe represent approximately 60% of our scheduled service capacity growth opportunities.\nContinue to Increase Our Margins and Free Cash Flow\n.\u2003From December\u00a031, 2017 through December\u00a031,\u00a02019, we reduced our CASM from 10.09\u00a0cents to 8.82\u00a0cents and our Adjusted CASM from 7.80\u00a0cents to 6.31\u00a0cents, a level comparable to ULCCs. For 2020, our CASM was 8.91 cents, compared to 8.86 cents in 2021 and Adjusted CASM was 7.57 cents for 2020 and 6.44 cents for 2021, respectively. When combined with our TRASM, which remains comparable to LCCs and higher than ULCCs, we generate highly competitive margins. Our period of investment in fleet renewal and transformative capital expenditures is largely behind us, and our focus has been on growth. We intend to continue to improve our leading margin and free cash flow profile through a variety of initiatives and measures. Key initiatives include further conversion to an owned (versus leased) model for aircraft ownership, leveraging our fixed cost base as we continue to grow our passenger aircraft fleet to achieve economies of scale, continuous optimization of our maintenance operations and completion of other ongoing strategic initiatives. As a result, we expect improvements in profit margins and free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow minus non-aircraft capital expenditures, following a rebound in the U.S. air travel market to support growth in the\u00a0years ahead.\n19\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur Scheduled Service Business\nWe provide low-fare passenger airline service primarily to leisure and VFR travelers. Our low fares are designed to stimulate demand from price-sensitive travelers seeking a superior product to ULCCs. For the\u00a0years ended December\u00a031, 2021, 2020 and 2019, our number of scheduled service passengers were approximately 2.7\u00a0million, 1.7 million and 3.6\u00a0million, respectively. For the\u00a0years ended December\u00a031,\u00a02021, 2020 and 2019, our average base fare was approximately $102.21, $114.96 and $111.08, respectively. Passengers and fares were both impacted dramatically by the COVID-19 pandemic in the\u00a0years ended December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020. We believe that the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019 is a more useful indicator of our average base fare and passenger statistics during normal industry conditions.\nIn addition to base fares, passengers can choose from a number of ancillary products for an additional cost. Sources of our ancillary revenue include baggage fees, seat selection fees, priority check-in and boarding fees, itinerary service fees, on-board sales and sales of trip insurance. Part\u00a0of our strategy has been to reduce base fares to stimulate demand while increasing ancillary revenue per passenger, which we believe offers passengers more choice and correspondingly, more ancillary revenue. Our on-board sales are also designed to enhance the customer experience, including local passenger favorite brands of beer, wine and spirits. For the\u00a0years ended December\u00a031, 2021, 2020 and 2019, our average ancillary revenue per passenger was approximately $42.89, $40.53, and $33.14, respectively. Overall ancillary revenues in 2021 and 2020 were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which drove a decline in the number of passengers, and during which we ceased on-board sales, among other actions to reduce the spread of the virus.\nWe also earn revenue from our Sun Country Vacations products, including commissions from the sale of third-party hotel rooms and rental cars. Our SCV products facilitate booking a flight and land package at a discounted price for our customers. We offer vacation products to promote \u201cone stop shopping.\u201d In 2019, our bookings for SCV were temporarily reduced in connection with a delay in the functionality for these services during the transition to our new booking system. Our other revenue also includes revenue from the transportation of mail and our co-branded credit card. During 2020, revenue from these other items decreased substantially as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we saw some recovery in 2021. Despite this, we continued to enhance functionality in our booking system and we believe that we are well-positioned to capture SCV and other revenue opportunities when the COVID-19 pandemic recedes.\nWe also offer interline connectivity with international and domestic airlines. In mid-2019, prior to our transition to \nNavitaire\n, we offered interline connectivity with seven carriers. We have reestablished interline connectivity in our \nNavitaire\n booking system and have identified additional opportunities to grow our interline connectivity.\nRoute Network\nOur network strategy is optimized between four key segments: MSP, non-MSP, charter services and cargo services. As Minnesota\u2019s hometown airline, a substantial portion of our business is serving markets originating or ending in MSP. Our MSP network served approximately 52 markets in 2019. In 2020 and 2021, we served 83 and 97 markets from MSP, respectively, in spite of the COVID-19 downturn. We believe that our TRASM in our MSP network for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031,\u00a02019 was higher than any ULCC in its hub. We have a leading position at Terminal 2 in MSP, which is preferred by many flyers because of its smaller layout, shorter security wait times, close parking relative to check-in and full suite of retail shops. We are the largest low-cost airline at MSP, with significant opportunity to continue to grow both seat share and destinations.\n20\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNon-MSP service is an increasingly significant portion of our business, having grown from eight non-MSP markets in 2017 to 30 in 2021. During the COVID-19 pandemic, non-MSP growth plans were slowed. We expect to continue to identify large demand markets where other airlines have been unable to respond to market needs during periods of seasonal demand. We have a successful history of opening and closing stations to meet seasonal demand. Since the start of 2019, we have launched 83 new markets, 31 of which we have subsequently closed. As part of the on-going assessment of market opportunities, we continue to identify future growth opportunities, primarily from Midwest locations to warm weather leisure destinations and large markets with fragmented and seasonal demand peaks.\nLandline offers convenient airport shuttle service for Sun Country passengers to the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport from five locations throughout Minnesota and two locations in Wisconsin.\n21\n\n\nTable of Contents\nBelow are maps of the routes we operated in 2017 and 2021 (including routes we operate on a seasonal basis):\n2017 Scheduled Service Route Map\n\u200b\n2021 Scheduled Service Route Map\n\u200b\nOur charter business is a core and integral piece of our network strategy that leverages our highly flexible operating certificate and flexible labor force to serve markets worldwide. In the future, we expect to continue to grow our charter service capacity. Our charter and scheduled service businesses complement each other as our integrated scheduling allows the most profitable use of the aircraft, either scheduled or charter, to be selected on a segment by segment basis. Aircraft and crew utilization can be maximized by filling in charter flying in periods when scheduled service flying is less profitable.\n22\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur air carrier operating certificate, labor agreements and operating capabilities allow us to fly to numerous destinations worldwide, which we believe is a benefit to our charter service. We have identified several growth opportunities across potential sports teams and leagues, third party charter brokers, VIP individuals, government, and leisure contracts. For example, we started regularly scheduled VIP charter service between LAX and KOA (Hawaii) with an all first-class configuration. Additionally, we have longstanding relationships with our charter customers who continue to rely on us as their trusted charter provider.\nOur cargo service performed under the ATSA serves destinations on Amazon\u2019s network. To the extent we can optimize flight crew on freighters with overlapping scheduled or charter service, we attempt to capture those synergies as well, though they are not core to that line of business. However, like the charter and scheduled service business, aircraft and crew utilization can be maximized by filling in cargo service in periods when scheduled service flying is less profitable.\nCompetition\nThe airline industry is highly competitive. The principal competitive factors in the airline industry are ticket prices, flight schedules, aircraft type, passenger amenities, customer service, reputation and frequent flyer programs. We have different competitive sets in our scheduled service business, charter business and cargo business.\nOur competitors and potential competitors in the scheduled service business include both legacy network airlines and low-cost airlines. Our key competitors on domestic routes include Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Travel Company, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines and United Airlines. Our charter business competitors include charter-only operators Swift/iAero Airways, as well as other scheduled passenger carriers who also operate charter flying, such as Delta Air Lines.\nThe principal competitors for our cargo business include ATSG and Southern Air. Our on-time arrival performance for our cargo business since starting operations in May\u00a02020, together with our operational capabilities, give us a stable position with our customer, Amazon.\nOur principal competitive advantages are our diversified and resilient business model, our agile peak demand scheduling strategy, our tactical mid-life fleet with flexible operations, our superior low-cost product and brand, our competitive low-cost structure, our strong position in our profitable MSP home market and our seasoned management team. We also believe the association of our brand with a high level of operational performance differentiates us from our competitors and enables us to generate greater customer loyalty. Our completion factor of 99.8% for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019, the last normalized\u00a0year before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, was higher than any ULCC. We improved this already leading completion factor to 99.9% in both 2020 and 2021.\nOur cost initiatives have yielded significant improvements in CASM. As a result of these improvements and our flexibility to serve seasonal and\u00a0year-round markets, we believe we are better positioned to offer a schedule tailored to properly serve periods of peak demand than our peers. The majority of our competitors maintain higher utilization to keep their unit costs low, which makes it difficult for them to serve markets on a highly seasonal or day-of-week basis. As such, we believe our low Adjusted CASM coupled with relatively low utilization is a competitive advantage.\nOur ability to maintain low unit costs at low utilization provides us with a competitive advantage to execute our agile peak demand network planning structure. Our peak demand strategy allows us to move into new markets quickly during periods when demand is maximized and there is less competitive pricing pressure.\nSee also \n\u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Related to Our Industry\u2014The airline industry is exceedingly competitive, and we compete against LCCS, ULCCs and legacy network airlines; if we are not able to compete successfully in our markets, our business will be materially adversely affected.\u201d\n23\n\n\nTable of Contents\nSeasonality\nThe airline industry has significant seasonal fluctuation in demand. Our network strategy is designed to take advantage of the seasonal nature of the leisure customer by concentrating our flying in seasons when demand is strongest and flying significantly less in seasons when demand is lower. As a result, our passenger business is subject to significant seasonal fluctuations, especially our scheduled service. While our passenger business will remain highly seasonal, our cargo operations will have the effect of mitigating seasonal troughs. For example, when our scheduled flying demand is lower during the fall and early December, our cargo service remains consistent and grows until Christmas.\nTraditionally, our business is geared towards north to south travel from MSP and the upper Midwest in the winter\u00a0months, our strongest travel season. During the summer\u00a0months, we focus on VFR traffic from MSP and leisure travelers originating in non-MSP markets. Although our actual results vary by season, we pride ourselves on the ability to adjust our route network and charter service to accommodate seasonality.\nDistribution\nWe sell our scheduled service flights through direct and indirect distribution channels with the goal of selling in the most efficient way across our customer base. Our direct distribution channels include our website and our call center and our indirect distribution channels include third parties, such as travel agents and OTAs (e.g., Priceline and websites owned by Expedia, including Orbitz and Travelocity).\nOur direct distribution channels are our lowest cost methods of distributing our product. In addition, they provide more opportunities to sell ancillary products and services, such as baggage services, priority check-in and boarding, and seat selections. With the introduction of our \nNavitaire\n-based reservation system and website in June\u00a02019, we have experienced a significant increase in the proportion of our bookings that are sold through direct channels. Sales through direct channels for the\u00a0years ended December\u00a031, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were 75%, 71% and 62%, respectively.\nIndirect distribution channels remain important outlets to sell our flights. Our movement in and out of markets where we may not have an established brand presence, is facilitated by the availability of our inventory through GDS companies (e.g., Amadeus, Sabre and Travelport). We also generate sales through OTAs, which also broadens our ability to sell in highly seasonal markets. Sales through these relatively higher cost indirect channels for the\u00a0years ended December\u00a031, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were 25%, 29% and 38%, respectively.\nWe sell our charter services through an internal, dedicated sales team that is focused on long-term relationships with key customers, brokers, organizations, and college and professional sports teams. While our CMI service is presently dedicated to Amazon and governed by the ATSA, we may expand our cargo business by marketing to new potential customers.\nMarketing\nWe are focused on direct-to-consumer marketing targeted at our core leisure and VFR travelers who pay for their own travel costs. Our marketing message is designed to convey our affordable and convenient flight options to leisure destinations. We often include our low base fares in marketing materials in order to stimulate demand.\nOur marketing tools are our proprietary email distribution list consisting of over one million email addresses, our Sun Country Rewards program, as well as advertisements online, on television, radio, digital billboards and other channels. Our objective is to use our low prices, quality customer service, and differentiated in-flight product to stimulate demand and drive customer loyalty.\n24\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe have a team of business development professionals who utilize business-to-business methods to identify opportunities and develop and maintain relationships with potential charter customers. We do not presently market our cargo business.\nLoyalty Program\nOur Sun Country Rewards frequent flyer program rewards and encourages scheduled service customer loyalty and we believe it is well tailored to serving the leisure passenger. Points earned are treated like currency and can be applied towards the purchase of all or a portion of our air travel tickets. This makes our program more valuable to leisure customers who travel less frequently and would have difficultly accumulating enough points to get discounted travel on other airlines. The Sun Country Airlines Visa Signature Card is the primary vehicle whereby customers earn points and our frequent flyer program is geared specifically towards supporting adoption and continued use of the credit card. Sun Country Rewards offers award travel on every flight without blackout dates. Points expire 36\u00a0months after the date they were earned, except those points held by Sun Country Visa cardholders do not expire so long as the holder maintains the card as active. Rewards are not available to charter or cargo customers.\nCustomers\nWe believe our customers are primarily leisure and VFR travelers who are paying for their own ticket and who make their purchase decision based largely on price. These customers respond well to demand stimulation based on low base fares. Our network is agile and is adjusted for seasonal demand shifts. In the winter\u00a0months, we largely focus on taking customers to warm weather destinations in the southern United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean. In the other times of the\u00a0year, we focus on VFR travelers to major markets and also provide service in markets where leisure or price sensitive customer demand is strong.\nWe believe our product appeals to price-sensitive customers because we give them the choice to pay only for the products and services they want. Overall, our business model is designed to deliver what we believe our customers want: low fares and a high quality flight experience.\nWe also complement our core business with charter operations. A significant portion of our charter business consists of repeat customers with whom we have long-term relationships, including several large casinos, college and professional sports teams. We have the ability to tailor our schedule to the specific needs of our charter customers, providing reliable operations, high completion factor and reasonable pricing for these customers.\nOur cargo business is dedicated to our customer, Amazon. We believe we are well-positioned to continue growing our cargo business over time with Amazon, while continuing to leverage ourselves to Amazon and potentially new customers.\n25\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOperational Performance\nWe are committed to delivering excellent operational performance, even in extreme weather conditions, which we believe supports our \u201cpeak demand,\u201d leisure-focused business model and will strengthen customer loyalty and attract new customers. This focus also strengthens our relationship with our cargo customer, Amazon, who has incentives and disincentives for performance in the ATSA. Our operational performance is enabled by our capable and dedicated workforce in maintenance, ground, flight crew and system operations, as well as our highly capable fleet of 737-NG aircraft, which are equipped to operate in adverse weather conditions worldwide. Our primary operational metrics are completion factor and on-time arrival performance because most of our markets are operated less than daily. Our completion factor of 99.8% for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019 was industry leading. We continued this leading completion factor into 2020 and 2021, where our completion factors were 99.9% in each\u00a0year. Our on-time arrival performance was 79.9%, 80.7%, and 69.9% for the\u00a0years ended December\u00a031, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These figures are inclusive of weather-driven cancelations, which our competitors often experience during extreme weather events in our home base of MSP. Our completion factor compares favorably to our competitors, with Sun Country leading among key competitor airlines as indicated below for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019, the last normalized\u00a0year before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u200b\nSource: US DOT Bureau of Transportation Statistics, scheduled passenger service\nAircraft Fuel\nAircraft fuel is generally our largest individual expense representing approximately 25.0%, 21.7% and 26.6% of our total operating costs for the\u00a0years ended December\u00a031, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The price and \n26\n\n\nTable of Contents\navailability of jet fuel are volatile due to global economic and geopolitical factors as well as domestic and local supply factors.

Average price per gallon includes related fuel fees and taxes but excludes fuel-hedging gains and losses.\nFrom time to time, we may enter into fuel derivative contracts in order to mitigate the risk to our business from future volatility in fuel prices, but such contracts may not fully protect us from all related risks. The intention of our fuel hedging program is not to manage earnings, but rather to protect our liquidity. As of December\u00a031, 2021, we had no fuel hedges in place, since the last of them matured in September\u00a02021. Generally speaking, our charter operations and the ATSA have pass-through provisions for fuel costs, and as such we do not hedge our fuel requirements for that portion of our business. Our hedges in place at the end of 2020 consisted of collars and call options, and the underlying commodities consisted of both Gulf Coast Jet Fuel contracts as well as West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil contracts. As of December\u00a031, 2021, we had no outstanding fuel derivative contracts and, at this time, we have no plans to hedge fuel going forward.\nTechnical Operations: Maintenance, Repairs and Overhaul\nWe have an FAA mandated and approved maintenance program, which is administered by an experienced group of Technical Operations leaders. All of our technicians are two-licensed Airframe and Powerplant and undergo extensive initial and recurrent training. Aircraft maintenance and repair consists of routine and non-routine maintenance, and work performed is divided into three general categories: line maintenance, heavy maintenance, and component maintenance.\nLine maintenance work is handled by our employees and maintenance contractors and consists of work performed between flights or overnight. Performing effective line maintenance is critical in maintaining a reliable operation and represents the majority of and most extensive maintenance we perform. Line maintenance consists of routine daily and weekly scheduled maintenance checks and unplanned maintenance on our aircraft. We maintain Sun Country technicians in Minneapolis, with limited line maintenance capabilities in Gulfport, Mississippi, Dallas-Fort Worth/Alliance Fort Worth, Texas, Lakeland Linder Airport, Florida, and Laughlin/Bullhead International Airport, Arizona. All other line maintenance is provided by third-party maintenance contractors as needed.\nHeavy maintenance consists of engine, auxiliary power\u00a0units, landing gear, and airframe overhauls, which some are quite extensive and can take several\u00a0months to complete. We maintain an inventory of spare engines to provide for continued operations during engine maintenance events. Airframe heavy maintenance visits consist of a series of complex tasks that generally take from one to six weeks to accomplish and are performed on a set schedule with varying repeat intervals. Due to our relatively small fleet size and projected fleet growth, we believe outsourcing all of our heavy maintenance, engine restoration and major part repair is more economical. On our cargo aircraft, heavy maintenance is a pass-through expense to our customer, Amazon.\nWe also outsource component maintenance. Component maintenance consists of the ongoing and routine maintenance of aircraft components that are line replaceable\u00a0units. These contracts cover the majority of our aircraft component inventory acquisition, replacement and repairs, thereby reducing the need to carry extensive spare parts inventory.\nEmployees\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, we had 2,181 and 1,699 employees, respectively.\n27\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFAA regulations require pilots to have commercial licenses with specific ratings for the aircraft to be flown and to be medically certified as physically fit to fly. FAA and medical certifications are subject to periodic renewal requirements including recurrent training and recent flying experience. Mechanics, quality-control inspectors and flight dispatchers must be certificated and qualified for specific aircraft. Flight attendants must have initial and periodic competency training and qualification. Training programs are subject to approval and monitoring by the FAA. Management personnel directly involved in the supervision of flight operations, training, maintenance and aircraft inspection must also meet experience standards prescribed by FAA regulations.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, approximately 46% of our employees were represented by labor unions under collective-bargaining agreements as set forth in the table below. Our pilots are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, our flight attendants are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and our dispatchers are represented by the Transport Workers Union. Our dispatchers approved a new contract in December\u00a02019, which is amendable on November\u00a014, 2024. Our collective bargaining agreement with our flight attendants became amendable on December\u00a031, 2019. We entered into negotiations in November\u00a02019. Negotiations were paused by mutual consent in March\u00a02020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We restarted negotiations with our flight attendants in October\u00a0of 2021 and negotiations are ongoing. Our collective bargaining agreement with our pilots was ratified on December\u00a021, 2021 and is amendable on December\u00a031, 2026.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, the status of the collective-bargaining agreements for our employees was as follows:\n\u200b\nEmployee Group\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nNumber\u00a0of\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEmployees\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nRepresentative\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nStatus\u00a0of\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAgreement/Amendable\u00a0Date\n\u00a0\nPilots\n\u200b\n456\n\u200b\nAir Line Pilots Association (ALPA)\n\u200b\nAmendable in December 2026\n\u200b\nFlight Attendants\n\u200b\n527\n\u200b\nInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT)\n\u200b\nCurrently amendable (commenced as of December 2019)\n\u200b\nDispatchers\n\u200b\n27\n\u200b\nTransport Workers Union (TWU)\n\u200b\nAmendable in November 2024\n\u200b\n\u200b\nThe United States Railway Labor Act (\u201cRLA\u201d) governs our relations with labor organizations. Under the RLA, the collective bargaining agreements generally do not expire, but instead become amendable as of a stated date. If either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement, they must notify the other party in the manner agreed to by the parties. Under the RLA, after receipt of such notice, the parties must meet for direct negotiations, and if no agreement is reached, either party may request the National Mediation Board (\u201cNMB\u201d) to appoint a federal mediator. The RLA prescribes no set timetable for the direct negotiation and mediation process. It is not unusual for those processes to last for many\u00a0months, and even for a few\u00a0years. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB in its discretion may declare at some time that an impasse exists, and if an impasse is declared, the NMB proffers binding arbitration to the parties. Either party may decline to submit to arbitration. If arbitration is rejected by either party, a 30-day \u201ccooling off\u201d period commences. During that period (or after), a Presidential Emergency Board (\u201cPEB\u201d) may be established, which examines the parties\u2019 positions and recommends a solution. The PEB process lasts for 30\u00a0days and is followed by another \u201ccooling off\u201d period of 30\u00a0days. At the end of a \u201ccooling off\u201d period, unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by Congress, the labor organization may strike and the airline may resort to \u201cself-help,\u201d including the imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments and the hiring of new employees to replace any striking workers. Congress and the President have the authority to prevent \u201cself-help\u201d by enacting legislation that, among other things, imposes a settlement on the parties.\nSafety and Security\nSafety is the most important thing we do and we are committed to the safety and security of our passengers and employees. In addition to complying with federally regulated safety and security standards, we strive to create a culture of safety and security that achieves the highest possible industry standard.\n28\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe have invested in a safety management system platform (ProSafeT), which allows for anonymous reporting of safety concerns by employees and business partners and promotes active participation in the identification, reduction and elimination of hazards. We also use ProSafeT as a central repository for tracking all Safety Assurance information, as well as Safety Risk Mitigation activities, creating awareness and transparency for the leadership teams to actively monitor the health of our Safety Management System (SMS) and Security Management System (SeMS). Our ongoing focus on safety relies on training our employees to proper standards and providing them with the tools and equipment they require so they can perform their job functions in a safe and efficient manner. Safety in the workplace targets several areas of our operation including: flight operations, maintenance, in-flight, dispatch and station operations.\nWe participate in ASIAS (FAA Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing System), which is a central conduit for the exchange of safety information among its stakeholders, and FOQA (Flight Operations Quality Assurance), a structured program to gather and aggregate electronically recorded flight operations data for the purpose of identifying areas where safety, efficiency and training can be improved. We invested in CEFA animation software which creates 3D flight video simulations using our data to enhance pilot training. Furthermore, we voluntarily completed the International Air Transport Association or IATA Operational Safety Audit in June\u00a02021, which is the benchmark for global safety. We also implemented a LOSA (Line Operations Safety Audit) program to proactively monitor and diagnose our operation\u2019s safety performance and a SeMS to protect the Company\u2019s assets and operations. Some of the other safety and security measures we have taken include: aircraft security and surveillance, positive bag matching procedures, enhanced passenger and baggage screening and search procedures and securing of cockpit doors.\nOur ongoing focus on safety relies on transparency with our regulators, training our employees to proper standards and providing them with the tools and equipment they require so they can perform their job functions in a safe and efficient manner, and learning from industry best practices through a collaborative, inter-airline safety sharing program. Safety in the workplace targets several areas of our operation, including: flight operations, maintenance, in-flight, dispatch and station operations. In addition, we recently conducted a safety culture survey, the results of which we have used to create action plans for areas of opportunity.\nInsurance\nWe maintain insurance policies we believe are of types customary in the airline industry and as required by the DOT, lessors and other financing parties. The policies principally provide liability coverage for public and passenger injury; damage to property; loss of or damage to flight equipment; fire; auto; directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability; advertiser and media liability; cyber risk liability; fiduciary; workers\u2019 compensation and employer\u2019s liability; and war risk (terrorism).\nForeign Ownership\nUnder federal law and DOT policy, we must be owned and controlled by U.S. citizens. The restrictions imposed by federal law and DOT policy currently require that at least 75% of our voting stock must be owned and controlled, directly and indirectly, by persons or entities who are citizens of the United States (\u201cU.S. citizens\u201d), as that term is defined in 49 U.S.C. \u00a740102(a)(15), that our president and at least two-thirds of the members of our Board of Directors and other managing officers be U.S. citizens, and that we be under the actual control of U.S. citizens. In addition, at least 51% of our total outstanding stock must be owned and controlled by U.S. citizens and no more than 49% of our stock may be owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by persons or entities who are not U.S. citizens and are from countries that have entered into \u201copen skies\u201d air transport agreements with the United States which allow unrestricted access between the United States and the applicable foreign country and to points beyond the foreign country on flights serving the foreign country. We are currently in compliance with these ownership provisions. For a discussion of the procedures we instituted to ensure compliance with these foreign ownership rules, please see \n\u201c\nRISK FACTORS\n\u00a0- \nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\u00a0- Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions limiting ownership and voting by non-U.S. citizens.\u201d\n29\n\n\nTable of Contents\nGovernment Regulation\nAviation Regulation\nThe airline industry is heavily regulated, especially by the federal government. Two of the primary regulatory authorities overseeing air transportation in the United States are the DOT and the FAA. The DOT has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity, exemptions and other economic authority required for airlines to provide domestic and foreign air transportation. International routes and international code-sharing arrangements are regulated by the DOT and by the governments of the foreign countries involved. A U.S. airline\u2019s ability to operate flights to and from international destinations is subject to the air transport agreements between the United States and the foreign country and the carrier\u2019s ability to obtain the necessary authority from the DOT and the applicable foreign government.\nThe U.S. government has negotiated \u201copen skies\u201d agreements with many countries, which allow unrestricted access between the United States and the applicable foreign country and to points beyond the foreign country on flights serving the foreign country. With certain other countries, however, the United States has a restricted air transportation agreement. Our international flights to Mexico are governed by a liberalized bilateral air transport agreement which the DOT has determined has all of the attributes of an \u201copen skies\u201d agreement. Changes in the aviation policies of the United States, Mexico or other countries in which we operate could result in the alteration or termination of the corresponding air transport agreement, diminish the value of our international route authorities or otherwise affect our operations to/from these countries.\nThe FAA is responsible for regulating and overseeing matters relating to the safety of air carrier flight operations, including the control of navigable air space, the qualification of flight personnel, flight training practices, compliance with FAA airline operating certificate requirements, aircraft certification and maintenance requirements and other matters affecting air safety. The FAA requires each commercial airline to obtain and hold an FAA air carrier certificate. We currently hold an FAA air carrier certificate.\nAirport Access\nIn the United States, the FAA currently regulates the allocation of take-off and landing authority, slots, slot exemptions, operating authorizations or similar capacity allocation mechanisms, which limit take-offs and landings, at certain airports. Level\u00a01 is assigned where the capacity of airport infrastructure is generally adequate to meet the demands of airport users at all times and therefore there is no extensive pattern of delays. Level\u00a02 is assigned where there is potential for congestion during some periods of the day, week or season, which can be resolved by schedule adjustments mutually agreed between the airlines and schedule facilitator. Level\u00a03 is assigned where (i)\u00a0demand for airport infrastructure significantly exceeds the airport\u2019s capacity during the relevant period; (ii)\u00a0expansion of airport infrastructure to meet demand is not possible in the short term; (iii)\u00a0attempts to resolve the problem through voluntary schedule adjustments have failed or are ineffective; and (iv)\u00a0as a result, a process of slot allocation is required whereby it is necessary for all airlines and other aircraft operators to have a slot allocated by a coordinator in order to arrive or depart at the airport during the periods when slot allocation occurs. We do not currently operate in or out of any Level\u00a03 airports. We currently operate, or plan to operate, in and out of San Francisco International Airport (SFO), Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport (ORD) and Newark International Airport (EWR), which are Level\u00a02 airports.\nIn addition, we have arranged for service to Vancouver, Canada, with flights starting in the second quarter of 2022. Terminal access for Vancouver is controlled by Vancouver Airport Authority due to facility constraints. We have obtained the access we need to accommodate our planned service.\n30\n\n\nTable of Contents\nConsumer Protection Regulation\nThe DOT also has jurisdiction over certain economic issues affecting air transportation and consumer protection matters, including unfair or deceptive practices and unfair methods of competition, lengthy tarmac delays, airline advertising, denied boarding compensation, ticket refunds, baggage liability, contracts of carriage, customer service commitments, consumer notices and disclosures, customer complaints and transportation of passengers with disabilities. The DOT frequently adopts new consumer protection regulations, such as rules\u00a0to protect passengers addressing lengthy tarmac delays, chronically delayed flights, codeshare disclosure and undisclosed display bias. They also have adopted, and do adopt, new rules\u00a0on airline advertising and marketing practices. The DOT also has authority to review certain joint venture agreements, marketing agreements, code-sharing agreements (where an airline places its designator code on a flight operated by another airline) and wet-leasing agreements (where one airline provides aircraft and crew to another airline) between carriers and regulates other economic matters such as slot transactions.\nSecurity Regulation\nThe TSA and the CBP, each a division of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, are responsible for certain civil aviation security matters, including passenger and baggage screening at U.S. airports, and international passenger prescreening prior to entry into or departure from the United States. International flights are subject to customs, border, immigration and similar requirements of equivalent foreign governmental agencies. We are currently in compliance with all directives issued by such agencies.\nEnvironmental Regulation\nWe are subject to various federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and affecting matters such as air emissions (including GHG emissions), noise emissions, discharges to surface and subsurface waters, safe drinking water, and the use, management, release, discharge and disposal of, and exposure to, materials and chemicals.\nWe are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that require us to investigate and remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain remediation standards. Under certain laws, generators of waste materials, and current and former owners or operators of facilities, can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at locations that have been identified as requiring response actions. Liability under these laws may be strict, joint and several, meaning that we could be liable for the costs of cleaning up environmental contamination regardless of fault or the amount of wastes directly attributable to us.\n31\n\n\nTable of Contents\nGHG Emissions\nConcern about climate change and greenhouse gases has resulted, and is expected to continue to result, in additional regulation or taxation of aircraft emissions in the United States and abroad. In particular, on March\u00a06, 2017, the ICAO or International Civil Aviation Organization, an agency of the United Nations established to manage the administration and governance of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, adopted new carbon dioxide, or CO2 certification standards for new aircraft beginning in 2020. The new CO2 standards will apply to new aircraft type designs from 2020, and to aircraft type designs already in production as of 2023. In-production aircraft that do not meet the standard by 2028 will no longer be able to be produced unless their designs are modified to meet the new standards. In August\u00a02016, the EPA made a final endangerment finding that GHG emissions cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare, which obligates the EPA under the Clean Air Act to set GHG emissions standards for aircraft. On January\u00a011, 2021, the EPA issued a proposed rule\u00a0regulating GHG emissions from aircraft that largely conforms to the March\u00a02017 ICAO standards. However, President Biden, who is expected to promote more aggressive policies with respect to climate change and carbon emissions, including in the aviation sector, issued an executive order calling for a review of regulatory actions of the prior administration for their consistency with the Biden administration\u2019s policies, including with respect to climate change. Accordingly, there may be future rulemaking that may result in stricter GHG emissions standards than those contained in the proposed rule.\nIn addition, in October\u00a02016, the ICAO adopted the CORSIA, which is a global, market-based emissions offset program designed to encourage carbon-neutral growth beyond 2020. The CORSIA will increase operating costs for us and other U.S. airlines that operate internationally. The CORSIA is being implemented in phases, with information sharing that began in 2019 and a pilot phase that began in 2021. Certain details are still being developed and the impact cannot be fully predicted.\nNoise\nFederal law recognizes the right of airport operators with special noise problems to implement local noise abatement procedures so long as those procedures do not interfere unreasonably with interstate and foreign commerce and the national air transportation system, subject to FAA review under the Airport Noise and Control Act of 1990. These restrictions can include limiting nighttime operations, directing specific aircraft operational procedures during take-off and initial climb and limiting the overall number of flights at an airport. While we have had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions in the past, our operations could be adversely impacted if ICAO or locally imposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread.\nOther Regulations\nAirlines are also subject to various other federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. For example, the U.S. Department of Justice has jurisdiction over certain airline competition matters. The privacy and security of passenger and employee data is regulated by various domestic and foreign laws and regulations.", "item1a": ">ITEM\u00a01A: RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n32\n\n\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nThe global pandemic resulting from the novel coronavirus has had and continues to have an adverse impact that has been and continues to be material to our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity, and the duration and spread of the pandemic could result in additional adverse impacts. A worsening of the outbreak or another disease or similar public health threat in the future could also have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nOn March\u00a011, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic causing a massive market disruption to the aviation industry. Measures such as travel restrictions, including testing regimes, \u201cstay at home\u201d and quarantine orders, limitations on public gatherings, cancellation of public events and many others have resulted in a decline in demand for air travel.\nWhile most restrictions have been removed in the United States, and a recovery appears to be underway in the domestic airline industry, additional governmental and other restrictions and regulations that may be implemented in the future in response to further outbreaks of COVID-19 include additional travel restrictions (including expanded restrictions on domestic air travel within the United States), quarantines of additional populations (including our personnel), limitations on aircraft capacity, testing requirements and restrictions on our ability to access our facilities or aircraft or requirements to collect additional passenger data. In addition, governments, non-governmental organizations and entities in the private sector may issue non-binding advisories or recommendations regarding air travel or other physical distancing measures, including limitations on the number of persons that should be present at public gatherings, which may significantly reduce demand. These and other restrictions and regulations have had, and will continue to have, a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe began experiencing a significant decline in demand related to COVID-19 during the first quarter of 2020, and this reduction in demand has continued through December\u00a02021. The decline in demand caused a material deterioration in our revenues. We plan to proactively manage capacity for the foreseeable future, which has a negative impact on our revenue. We expect to continue our proactive management of costs, but decreased demand can lead to higher unit costs. In addition, actual or perceived risk of infection on our flights could have a material adverse effect on the public\u2019s demand for and willingness to use air travel, which could harm our reputation and business. Demand for scheduled service business is negatively correlated to case counts in Minnesota and the destinations of our scheduled flights and to the extent that variants cause higher case counts, we could see further reductions in demand. Furthermore, historically, unfavorable U.S. economic conditions have driven changes in travel patterns, including significantly and materially reduced spending for both leisure and business travel. Unfavorable economic conditions, when low fares are often used to stimulate traffic, have also historically hampered the ability of airlines to raise fares to counteract any increases in fuel, labor and other costs. Any significant increases in unemployment in the United States would likely continue to have a negative impact on passenger bookings, especially when the customers we serve are paying with their own money, and these effects could exist for an extensive period of time. Even once the pandemic and fears of travel subside, demand for air travel may remain weak for a significant period of time. Apart from the decrease in demand, passenger bookings have been on average much closer to the date of service during pandemic than in prior periods, which has reduced our visibility into future revenue.\nIn addition to the schedule reductions discussed above, we continue to focus on reducing expenses and managing our liquidity and we expect to continue to modify our cost management structure, liquidity-raising efforts and capacity as the timing of demand recovery becomes more certain.\n33\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOn April\u00a020, 2020, we entered into a Payroll Support Program Agreement under the CARES Act with Treasury governing our participation in the Payroll Support Program and, on January\u00a029, 2021, we entered into a second Payroll Support Program Agreement under the CARES Act. Under the Payroll Support Program, Treasury provided us with an aggregate of $62,312 in grants from April\u00a021, 2020 to October\u00a01, 2020 and an additional $37,040 in grants during the first half of 2021 (collectively, the \u201cPayroll Support Payments\u201d). Further, we were notified on April\u00a015, 2021 that we would receive a grant of $34,547 under Payroll Support Program 3, which was received during April\u00a0and May\u00a02021. In addition, on October\u00a026, 2020, we entered into a loan and guarantee agreement (the \u201cCARES Act Loan Agreement\u201d) with the Treasury under the aviation direct loan program of the CARES Act, pursuant to which the Treasury agreed to extend loans to us in an aggregate principal amount of $45,000, subject to specified terms, which was due to be repaid on the earlier of (i)\u00a0October\u00a024, 2025 or (ii)\u00a0six\u00a0months prior to the expiration date of any material loyalty program securing the loan. We used a portion of the net proceeds from our initial public offering to repay in full all amounts outstanding under the CARES Act Loan. The substance and duration of restrictions to which we are subject under the grants and/or loans under the CARES Act, including, but not limited to, those outlined below could materially affect our operations, and we may not be successful in managing these impacts. Further, these restrictions could limit our ability to take actions that we otherwise might have determined to be in the best interest of our company and our stockholders. In particular, limitations on executive compensation may impact our ability to attract and retain senior management or attract other key employees during this critical time. Additionally, limitations on dividends and buybacks may diminish investor interest in our stock. See \u201c\u2014Risks Related to Our Business\u2014We are subject to certain restrictions on our business as a result of our participation in governmental programs under the CARES Act and we may be subject to similar or other restrictions pursuant to future governmental programs.\u201d\nOur operations may be further impacted in the event of additional instances of actual or perceived risk of infection among our employees, suppliers or business partners, and this impact may have a material adverse effect if we are unable to maintain a suitably skilled and sized workforce and address related employee matters. In addition, supply chain disruptions may impede our cargo customers\u2019 ability to deliver freight to the airports we serve, which could reduce their need for our services and thus have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe industry may also be subject to enhanced health and hygiene requirements in attempts to counteract future outbreaks, which requirements may be costly and take a significant amount of time to implement, or drive additional staffing during a time when staffing shortages are commonplace.\nWe may take additional actions to improve our financial position, including measures to improve liquidity, such as the issuance of unsecured and secured debt securities, equity securities and equity-linked securities, the sale of assets and/or the entry into additional bilateral and syndicated secured and/or unsecured credit facilities. There can be no assurance as to the timing of any such issuance, which may be in the near term, or that any such additional financing will be completed on favorable terms, or at all. Any such actions may be material in nature and could result in significant additional borrowing. Our reduction in expenditures, measures to improve liquidity or other strategic actions that we may take in the future in response to COVID-19 may not be effective in offsetting decreased demand, and we will not be permitted to take certain strategic actions as a result of the CARES Act, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition.\nThe full extent of the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our longer-term operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, many of which are outside of our control, including the effectiveness of the mitigation strategies discussed above, the duration, spread, severity and recurrence of COVID-19 and any COVID-19 variants and related travel advisories and restrictions, the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, the impact of COVID-19 on overall long-term demand for air travel, including after the pandemic subsides, the impact of COVID-19 on the financial health and operations of our business partners, future governmental actions, including their duration and scope, and our access to capital, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\n34\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, an outbreak of another disease or similar public health threat, or fear of such an event, that affects travel demand, travel behavior, travel restrictions or adversely affects supply chains, which would impact our cargo business, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. Outbreaks of other diseases could also result in increased government restrictions and regulation, such as those actions described above or otherwise, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nEven after the COVID-19 pandemic has moderated and the enhanced screenings, quarantine and other requirements, and travel restrictions have eased, we may continue to experience similar adverse effects to our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity resulting from a recessionary or depressed economic environment that may persist, including increases in unemployment, and our business and operating results may not return to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels on a timely basis or at all. The impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our businesses, operating results, financial condition and liquidity could exacerbate the other risks identified in this report.\nWe are depending upon continued uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine by the general public in order to normalize economic conditions, the airline industry and our business operations and to realize our planned financial and growth plans and business strategy. The failure of a vaccine, significant unplanned adverse reactions to the vaccine, politicization of the vaccine or general public distrust of the vaccine, or a vaccine requirement to travel, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nOur financial and operating results and business operations for our scheduled service and charter businesses for the\u00a0years ended December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020 were materially and adversely impacted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which impact is likely to continue during the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are depending upon an efficient distribution and sufficient supply of the COVID-19 vaccine, and continued uptake by the general public in order to normalize economic conditions, the airline industry and our business operations and to realize our financial and growth plans and business strategy. To date, COVID-19 vaccinations have been widespread, but many remain unvaccinated, as the long-term efficacy of the vaccines, including against variants, remains uncertain. The failure of a vaccine, including to the extent it is not effective against any COVID-19 variants, significant unplanned adverse reactions to the vaccine, politicization of the vaccine or general public distrust of the vaccine, especially if combined with a vaccine requirement to travel, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n35\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe demand for airline services is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions, and another recession or similar or worse economic downturn in the United States would weaken demand for our services and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe demand for travel and cargo services is affected by U.S. and global economic conditions. Unfavorable economic conditions have historically reduced aviation spending. For most passengers visiting friends and relatives and cost-conscious leisure travelers (our primary market), travel is a discretionary expense, and during periods of unfavorable economic conditions as a result of such carriers\u2019 low base fares travelers have often elected to replace air travel at such times with car travel or other forms of ground transportation or have opted not to travel at all. Likewise, during periods of unfavorable economic conditions, businesses have deferred air travel or forgone it altogether. Additionally, retail and thus cargo demand can also decrease. Furthermore, most of our charter revenue is generated from ad hoc or short-term contracts with repeat customers, and these customers may cease using our services or seek to negotiate more aggressive pricing during periods of unfavorable economic conditions. Any reduction in charter or cargo revenue during such periods could also increase our unit costs and thus have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Travelers have also reduced spending by purchasing fewer ancillary services, which can result in a decrease in average revenue per seat. Because airlines typically have relatively high fixed costs as a\u00a0percentage of total costs, much of which cannot be mitigated during periods of lower demand for air travel or cargo services, the airline business is particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions. Furthermore, if the COVID-19 pandemic leads to a recession or depression, this could result in further reductions in demand for our services. A reduction in the demand for air travel or cargo services due to unfavorable economic conditions also limits our ability to raise fares or fees for cargo services to counteract increased fuel, labor and other costs. If U.S. or global economic conditions are unfavorable or uncertain for an extended period of time, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business has been, and in the future may be, materially adversely affected by the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Unexpected increases in the price of aircraft fuel or a shortage or disruption in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe cost of aircraft fuel is highly volatile and in recent\u00a0years has been our largest individual operating expense, accounting for approximately 25.0%, 21.7% and 26.6% of our operating expenses for the\u00a0years ended December\u00a031, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. High fuel prices or increases in fuel costs (or in the price of crude oil) could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, including as a result of legacy network airlines and LCCs adapting more rapidly or effectively to higher fuel prices through new-technology aircraft that is more fuel efficient than our aircraft. Over the past several\u00a0years, the price of aircraft fuel has fluctuated substantially and prices continue to be highly volatile and have recently increased significantly. In addition, prolonged low fuel prices could limit our ability to differentiate our product and low fares from those of the legacy network airlines and LCCs, as prolonged low fuel prices could enable such carriers to, among other things, substantially decrease their costs, fly longer stages or utilize older aircraft.\nOur business is also dependent on the availability of aircraft fuel (or crude oil), which is not predictable. Weather-related events, natural disasters, terrorism, wars, supply chain disruptions, political disruption or instability involving oil-producing countries, changes in governmental or cartel policy concerning crude oil or aircraft fuel production, labor strikes or other events affecting refinery production, transportation, taxes or marketing, environmental concerns, market manipulation, price speculation, changes in currency exchange rates and other unpredictable events may drive actual or perceived fuel supply shortages. Shortages in the availability of, or increases in demand for, crude oil in general, other crude oil-based fuel derivatives and aircraft fuel in particular could result in increased fuel prices and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to increase ticket prices sufficiently to cover increased fuel costs, particularly when fuel prices rise quickly. We sell a significant number of tickets to passengers well in advance of travel, and, as a \n36\n\n\nTable of Contents\nresult, fares sold for future travel may not reflect increased fuel costs. In addition, our ability to increase ticket prices to offset an increase in fuel costs is limited by the competitive nature of the airline industry and the price sensitivity associated with air travel, particularly leisure travel, and any increases in fares may reduce the general demand for air travel. Additionally, our cargo and charter customers may choose to refuse fuel pass-through contracts, which could drive down the profitability of those agreements.\nFrom time to time, we may enter into fuel derivative contracts in order to mitigate the risk to our business from future volatility in fuel prices but such contracts may not fully protect us from all related risks. Generally speaking, our charter and cargo operations have pass-through provisions for fuel costs, and as such we do not hedge our fuel requirements for that portion of our business. As of December\u00a031, 2021, we had no outstanding fuel derivative contracts.\nWe may enter into derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, which can impact our results of operations and increase the volatility of our earnings due to recognizing the mark-to-market impact of our hedge portfolio as a result of changes in the forward markets for oil and/or jet fuel. We cannot assure you our fuel hedging program will be effective or that we will maintain a fuel hedging program. Even if we are able to hedge portions of our future fuel requirements, we cannot guarantee that our hedge contracts will provide an adequate level of protection against increased fuel costs or that the counterparties to our hedge contracts will be able to perform. Additionally, our ability to realize the benefit of declining fuel prices will be limited by the impact of any fuel hedges in place, we may incur additional expenses in connection with entering into derivative contracts and we may record significant losses on fuel hedges during periods of declining prices. A failure of our fuel hedging strategy, potential margin funding requirements, overpaying for fuel through the use of hedging arrangements or our failure to maintain a fuel hedging program could prevent us from adequately mitigating the risk of fuel price increases and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThreatened or actual terrorist attacks or security concerns involving airlines could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPast terrorist attacks or attempted attacks, particularly those against airlines, have caused substantial revenue losses and increased security costs, and any actual or threatened terrorist attack or security breach, even if not directly against an airline, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Security concerns resulting in enhanced passenger screening, increased regulation governing carry-on baggage and cargo and other similar restrictions on passenger travel and cargo may further increase passenger inconvenience and reduce the demand for air travel or increase costs associated with providing cargo service. In addition, increased or enhanced security measures have tended to result in higher governmental fees imposed on airlines, resulting in higher operating costs for airlines, which we may not be able to pass on to customers in the form of higher prices. Terrorist attacks, or the fear of such attacks or other hostilities (including elevated national threat warnings or selective cancellation or redirection of flights due to terror threats), even if not made directly on or involving the airline industry, could have a negative impact on the airline industry and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe airline industry is exceedingly competitive, and we compete against new entrants, LCCs, ULCCs, legacy network airlines and cargo carriers; if we are not able to compete successfully in our markets, our business will be materially adversely affected.\nWe face significant competition with respect to routes, fares and services. Within the airline industry, we compete with new airlines, ULCCs, LCCs and legacy network airlines for airline passengers traveling on the routes we serve, particularly customers traveling in economy or similar classes of service. Competition on most of the routes we presently serve is intense, due to the large number of carriers in those markets. Furthermore, other airlines or new airlines may begin service or increase existing service on routes where we currently face no or little competition. In almost all instances, our competitors are larger than we are and possess significantly greater financial and other resources than we do.\n37\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe airline industry is particularly susceptible to price discounting because once a flight is scheduled, airlines incur only nominal additional costs to provide service to passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats. Increased fare or other price competition could adversely affect our operations. Airlines typically use discount fares and other promotions to stimulate traffic during normally slower travel periods to generate cash flow and to increase revenue per available seat mile. The prevalence of discount fares can be particularly acute when a competitor has excess capacity to sell. Moreover, many other airlines have unbundled their services, at least in part, by charging separately for services such as baggage and advance seat selection, which previously were offered as a component of base fares. This unbundling and other cost-reducing measures could enable competitor airlines to reduce fares on routes that we serve. The availability of low-priced fares coupled with an increase in domestic capacity has led to dramatic changes in pricing behavior in many U.S. markets. Many domestic carriers began matching lower cost airline pricing, either with limited or unlimited inventory.\nDuring economic downturns, including during a health crisis, our competitors may choose to take an aggressive posture toward market share growth on routes where we compete, which would flood a low demand market with additional capacity that drives down fares, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur growth and the success of our high-growth, low-cost business model could stimulate competition in our markets through our competitors\u2019 development of their own LCC or ULCC strategies, new pricing policies designed to compete with LCCs, ULCCs or new market entrants. Airlines increase or decrease capacity in markets based on perceived profitability. If our competitors increase overall industry capacity, or capacity dedicated to a particular domestic or foreign region, market or route that we serve, it could have a material adverse impact on our business. If a legacy network airline were to successfully develop a low-cost product or if we were to experience increased competition from LCCs, our business could be materially adversely affected. Regardless of cost structure, the domestic airline industry has often been the source of fare wars undertaken to grow market share or for other reasons.\nA competitor adopting an LCC or ULCC strategy may have greater financial resources and access to lower cost sources of capital than we do, which could enable them to operate their business with a lower cost structure, or enable them to operate with lower marginal revenues without substantial adverse effects, than we can. If these competitors adopt and successfully execute an LCC or ULCC business model, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nSimilarly, our competitors may choose to commence or expand their existing charter operations, which could adversely impact our ability to obtain or renew charter contracts, especially in periods of low demand. This could result in decreases in our charter services market share and reduced profitability for our charter operations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur competitors may also choose to commence, or expand their existing, cargo operations. In addition, our competitors could seek to provide cargo services to Amazon, which could adversely impact our ability to maintain or renew the ATSA. This could result in reduced frequencies for our cargo operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThere has been significant consolidation within the airline industry, including, for example, the combinations of American Airlines and US Airways, Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines, United Airlines and Continental Airlines, Southwest Airlines and AirTran Airways, and Alaska Airlines and Virgin America. In the future, there may be additional consolidation in our industry. Business combinations could significantly alter industry conditions and competition within the airline industry and could permit our competitors to reduce their fares.\n38\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe extremely competitive nature of the airline industry could prevent us from attaining the level of passenger traffic or maintaining the level of fares or ancillary revenues required to sustain profitable operations in new and existing markets and could impede our growth strategy, which could harm our operating results. Due to our relatively small size, we are susceptible to a fare war or other competitive activities in one or more of the markets we serve, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAirlines are often affected by factors beyond their control including: air traffic congestion at airports; air traffic control inefficiencies; air traffic control staffing and pandemic impact; government shutdowns or mandates; FAA grounding of aircraft; major construction or improvements at airports; adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes or blizzards; increased security measures; new travel-related taxes; or the outbreak of disease, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLike other airlines, our business is affected by factors beyond our control, including air traffic congestion at airports, air traffic control inefficiencies, major construction or improvements at airports at which we operate, increased security measures, new travel-related taxes and fees, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters and the outbreak of disease. Factors that cause flight delays frustrate passengers and increase costs and decrease revenues, which in turn could adversely affect profitability. The federal government controls all U.S. airspace, and airlines are completely dependent on the FAA to operate that airspace in a safe, efficient and affordable manner. The air traffic control system, which is operated by the FAA, faces challenges in managing the growing demand for U.S. air travel. U.S. and foreign air traffic controllers often rely on outdated technologies that routinely overwhelm the system and compel airlines to fly inefficient, indirect routes resulting in delays. The federal government also controls airport security. In addition, there are proposals before Congress that would treat a wide range of consumer protection issues, which could increase the costs of doing business. Further, implementation of the Next Generation Air Transport System, or NextGen, by the FAA would result in changes to aircraft routings and flight paths that could lead to increased noise complaints and lawsuits, resulting in increased costs. In addition, federal government shutdowns can affect the availability of federal resources necessary to provide air traffic control and airport security. Furthermore, a federal government grounding of our aircraft type could result in flight cancellations and adversely affect our business. Governmental mandates requiring certain behaviors from employees, including COVID-19 vaccine mandates, could limit our ability to staff to meet demand because employees may choose to resign or decide not to apply for or accept open positions. Specifically, President Biden\u2019s recent Executive Order mandating that employers who maintain government contracts must require all employees to be fully vaccinated applies to our business and could have a negative impact on our ability to retain employees or hire new employees, which may adversely impact our business.\n39\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAdverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, thunderstorms, winter snowstorms or earthquakes, can cause flight cancellations or significant delays, and in the past have led to Congressional demands for investigations. Cancellations or delays due to adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, air traffic control problems or inefficiencies, breaches in security or other factors may affect us to a greater degree than other, larger airlines that may be able to recover more quickly from these events, and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition to a greater degree than other air carriers. Because of our day of week, limited schedule and optimized utilization and point-to-point network, operational disruptions can have a disproportionate impact on our ability to recover. In addition, many airlines reaccommodate their disrupted passengers on other airlines at prearranged rates under flight interruption manifest agreements. We have been unsuccessful in procuring any of these agreements with our peers, which makes our recovery from disruption more challenging than for larger airlines that have these agreements in place. Similarly, outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases, such as ebola, measles, avian flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), COVID-19, H1N1 (swine) flu, pertussis (whooping cough) and zika virus, or their respective variants, could result in significant decreases in passenger traffic and the imposition of government restrictions in service and could have a material adverse impact on the airline industry. Any increases in travel-related taxes could also result in decreases in passenger traffic. Any general reduction in airline passenger traffic could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, U.S. federal government shutdowns may cause delays and cancellations or reductions in discretionary travel due to longer security lines, including as a result of furloughed government employees or reductions in staffing levels, including air traffic controllers. U.S. government shutdowns may also impact our ability to take delivery of aircraft and commence operations in new domestic stations. Another extended shutdown like the instance in December\u00a02018-January\u00a02019 may have a negative impact on our operations and financial results.\nThe industry is experiencing higher than normal number of pilot retirements, increased competition in pilot hiring, more stringent duty time regulations, increased flight hour requirements for commercial airline pilots, reductions in the number of military pilots entering the commercial workforce, increased training requirements and other factors that may lead to a shortage of pilots, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nLarge numbers of pilots in the industry are approaching the FAA\u2019s mandatory retirement age of 65 or have otherwise accepted an early retirement during the COVID-19 pandemic. Commercial airline pilots are subject to rigorous certification standards and must adhere to flight time and rest requirements. Commencing in 2013, the minimum flight hour requirement to achieve a commercial pilot\u2019s license in the United States increased from 250 to 1,500 hours, thereby significantly increasing the time and cost commitment required to become licensed to fly a commercial aircraft. Additionally, the number of military pilots being trained by the U.S. armed forces and available as commercial pilots upon their retirement from military service has been decreasing. These and other factors may lead to a shortage of qualified, entry-level pilots and increased compensation costs, particularly at carriers other than the large legacy carriers. The foregoing factors may lead to additional competition from carriers attempting to meet their hiring needs. If a shortage of pilots materializes, airlines may be unable to hire adequate numbers of pilots to meet their needs, resulting in a reduction in the number of flights offered, disruptions, increased costs of operations, financial difficulties and other adverse effects, and these circumstances may become more severe in the future and thereby cause a material adverse effect on our business.\n40\n\n\nTable of Contents\nRisks associated with our presence in international markets, including political or economic instability, and failure to adequately comply with existing and changing legal requirements, may materially adversely affect us.\nSome of our target growth markets include countries with less developed economies, legal systems, financial markets and business and political environments that are vulnerable to economic and political disruptions, such as significant fluctuations in gross domestic product, interest and currency exchange rates, civil disturbances, government instability, nationalization and expropriation of private assets, trafficking and the imposition of taxes or other charges by governments, as well as health and safety concerns. The occurrence of any of these events in markets served by us now or in the future and the resulting instability may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe emphasize compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in all jurisdictions where we operate and have implemented and continue to implement and refresh policies, procedures and certain ongoing training of our employees, third-party providers and partners with regard to business ethics and key legal requirements; however, we cannot assure that our employees, third-party providers or partners will adhere to our code of ethics, other policies or other legal requirements. If we fail to enforce our policies and procedures properly or maintain adequate recordkeeping and internal accounting practices to record our transactions accurately, we may be subject to sanctions. In the event we believe or have reason to believe our employees, third-party providers or partners have or may have violated applicable laws or regulations, we may incur investigation costs, potential penalties and other related costs, which in turn may materially adversely affect our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf any of our aircraft were to be involved in a significant accident or if our property or operations were to be affected by a significant natural catastrophe or other event, we could be exposed to material liability or loss. If insurance markets harden due to other airline global incidents, general aviation incidents or other economic factors, we could be unable to obtain sufficient insurance (including aviation hull and liability insurance and property and business interruption coverage) to cover such liabilities or losses, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe currently obtain war risk insurance coverage (terrorism insurance) as part of our commercial aviation hull and liability policy, and additional excess third-party war risk insurance through the commercial aviation war risk market. Our current war risk insurance from commercial underwriters excludes nuclear, radiological and certain other events. The global insurance market for aviation-related risks has been faced with significant losses, resulting in substantial tightening in insurance markets with reduced capacity and increased prices. If we are unable to obtain adequate third-party hull and liability or third-party war risk (terrorism) insurance or if an event not covered by the insurance we maintain were to take place, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n41\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe airline industry is heavily taxed.\nThe airline industry is subject to extensive government fees and taxation that negatively impact our revenue and profitability. The U.S. airline industry is one of the most heavily taxed of all industries. These fees and taxes have grown significantly in the past decade for domestic flights, and various U.S. fees and taxes also are assessed on international flights. For example, as permitted by federal legislation, most major U.S. airports impose a passenger facility charge per passenger on us. In addition, the governments of foreign countries in which we operate impose on U.S. airlines, including us, various fees and taxes, and these assessments have been increasing in number and amount in recent\u00a0years. Moreover, we are obligated to collect a federal excise tax, commonly referred to as the \u201cticket tax,\u201d on domestic and international air transportation. We collect the excise tax, along with certain other U.S. and foreign taxes and user fees on air transportation (such as passenger security fees), and pass along the collected amounts to the appropriate governmental agencies. Although these taxes and fees are not our operating expenses, they represent an additional cost to our customers, that can drive down demand as we operate in a highly elastic environment, drives down demand. There are continuing efforts in Congress and in other countries to raise different portions of the various taxes, fees, and charges imposed on airlines and their passengers, including the passenger facility charge, and we may not be able to recover all of these charges from our customers. Increases in such taxes, fees and charges could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUnder regulations set forth by the Department of Transportation, or the DOT, all governmental taxes and fees must be included in the prices we quote or advertise to our customers. Due to the competitive revenue environment, many increases in these fees and taxes have been absorbed by the airline industry rather than being passed on to the customer. Further increases in fees and taxes may reduce demand for air travel, and thus our revenues.\nRestrictions on or increased taxes applicable to charges for ancillary products and services paid by airline passengers and burdensome consumer protection regulations or laws could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFor the\u00a0years ended December\u00a031, 2021, 2020 and 2019 we generated ancillary revenues of $117,237, $68,055 and $118,158, respectively. Our ancillary revenue consists primarily of revenue generated from air travel-related services such as baggage fees, seat selection and upgrade fees, itinerary service fees, on-board sales and sales of trip insurance. The DOT has rules\u00a0governing many facets of the airline-consumer relationship, including, for instance, consumer notice requirements, handling of consumer complaints, price advertising, lengthy tarmac delays, oversales and denied boarding process/compensation, ticket refunds, liability for loss, delay or damage to baggage, customer service commitments, contracts of carriage, consumer disclosures and the transportation of passengers with disabilities. The DOT periodically audits airlines to determine whether such airlines have violated any of the DOT rules. If the DOT determines that we are not, or have not been, in compliance with these rules\u00a0or if we are unable to remain compliant, the DOT may subject us to fines or other enforcement action. The DOT may also impose additional consumer protection requirements, including adding requirements to modify our websites and computer reservations system, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The U.S. Congress and the DOT have examined the increasingly common airline industry practice of unbundling the pricing of certain products and ancillary services, a practice that is a core component of our business strategy. If new laws or regulations are adopted that make unbundling of airline products and services impermissible, or more cumbersome or expensive, or if new taxes are imposed on ancillary revenues, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted. Congressional, Federal agency and other government scrutiny may also change industry practice or the public\u2019s willingness to pay for ancillary services. See also \u201c\u2014Risks Related to Our Business\u2014We are subject to extensive regulation by the FAA, the DOT, the TSA, CBP and other U.S. and foreign governmental agencies, compliance with which could cause us to incur increased costs and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\u201d\n42\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to risks associated with climate change, including increased regulation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.\nConcern about climate change and greenhouse gases has resulted, and is expected to continue to result, in additional regulation or taxation of aircraft emissions in the United States and abroad. In particular, on March\u00a06, 2017, ICAO, an agency of the United Nations established to manage the administration and governance of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, adopted new carbon dioxide, or CO2 certification standards for new aircraft beginning in 2020. The new CO2 standards will apply to new aircraft type designs from 2020, and to aircraft type designs already in production as of 2023.\nIn-production aircraft that do not meet the standard by 2028 will no longer be able to be produced unless their designs are modified to meet the new standards. In August\u00a02016, the Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, made a final endangerment finding that aircraft engine greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare, which obligates the EPA under the Clean Air Act to set GHG emissions standards for aircraft. On January\u00a011, 2021, the EPA issued a rule\u00a0regulating GHG emissions from aircraft that largely conforms to the March\u00a02017 ICAO standards. However, on January\u00a020, 2021, President Biden, who is expected to promote more aggressive policies with respect to climate change and carbon emissions, issued an executive order calling for a review of regulatory actions of the prior administration for their consistency with the Biden administration\u2019s policies, including with respect to climate change. Accordingly, may result in stricter GHG emissions standards than those contained in the rule. In addition, federal climate legislation, including the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d resolution, has been introduced in Congress recently, although Congress has yet to pass a bill specifically addressing GHG regulation. Several states are also considering or have adopted initiatives to regulate emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of GHG emissions inventories and/or regional cap-and-trade programs.\nIn addition, in October\u00a02016, the ICAO adopted the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, or CORSIA, which is a global, market-based emissions offset program designed to encourage carbon-neutral growth beyond 2020. Further, in June\u00a02018 the ICAO adopted standards pertaining to the collection and sharing of information on international aviation emissions beginning in 2019. The CORSIA will increase operating costs for us and other U.S. airlines that operate internationally. The CORSIA is being implemented in phases, with information sharing beginning in 2019 and a pilot phase beginning in 2021. Certain details are still being developed and the impact cannot be fully predicted. The potential impact of the CORSIA or other emissions-related requirements on our costs will ultimately depend on a number of factors, including baseline emissions, the price of emission allowances or offsets that we would need to acquire, the efficiency of our fleet and the number of flights subject to these requirements. These costs have not been completely defined and could fluctuate.\nIn the event that legislation or regulation with respect to GHG emissions associated with aircraft or applicable to the fuel industry is enacted in the United States or other jurisdictions where we operate or where we may operate in the future, or as part of international conventions to which we are subject, it could result in significant costs for us and the airline industry. In addition to direct costs, such regulation may have a greater effect on the airline industry through increases in fuel costs that could result from fuel suppliers passing on increased costs that they incur under such a system.\n43\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe face competition from air travel substitutes.\nIn addition to airline competition from legacy network airlines, LCCs and ULCCs, we also face competition from air travel substitutes. Our business serves primarily leisure travelers, for whom travel is entirely discretionary. On our domestic routes, particularly those with shorter stage lengths, we face competition from some other transportation alternatives, such as bus, train or automobile. The new presidential administration and the new Secretary of the Department of Transportation have indicated strong support for trains. In addition, technology advancements may limit the demand for air travel. For example, video teleconferencing and other methods of electronic communication may reduce the need for in-person communication and add a new dimension of competition to the industry as travelers seek lower-cost substitutes for air travel. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated adoption of such technology and customers may be more likely to think it is sufficient for their needs, which could reduce demand for air travel. If we are unable to stimulate demand for air travel with our low base fares or if we are unable to adjust rapidly in the event the basis of competition in our markets changes, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf we fail to implement our business strategy successfully, our business will be materially adversely affected.\nOur business strategy includes growth in our aircraft fleet, expansion of markets we serve by building out our MSP hub, growing our seat share at MSP and growing non-MSP point-to-point markets, increasing the seats in each aircraft, expanding our ancillary product offering and growing our charter service. When developing our route network, we focus on gaining market share on routes that have been underserved or are served primarily by higher cost airlines where we have a competitive cost advantage. Effectively implementing our growth strategy is critical for our business to achieve economies of scale and to sustain or increase our profitability. The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected our growth plans and business strategy. We face numerous challenges in implementing our growth strategy, including our ability to:\n\u25cf\nsustain our relatively low unit costs, continue to realize attractive revenue performance and maintain profitability; stimulate traffic with low fares;\n\u25cf\nmaintain an optimal level of aircraft utilization, balanced with a low aircraft acquisition cost, to execute our scheduled, cargo and charter operations;\n\u25cf\nmaintain staffing levels sufficient to operate the full schedule and to grow rapidly;\n\u25cf\naccess airports located in our targeted geographic markets; and\n\u25cf\nmaintain operational performance necessary to complete all flights.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain access to a sufficient number of slots, gates or related ground facilities at desirable airports to accommodate our growing fleet, we may be unable to compete in desirable markets, our aircraft utilization rate could decrease, and we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurances that we will be able to grow our business at MSP or in non-MSP markets as we anticipate, or at all.\nOur growth is also dependent upon our ability to maintain a safe and secure operation and will require additional personnel, equipment and facilities as we induct new aircraft and continue to execute our growth plan. In addition, we will require additional third-party personnel for services we do not undertake ourselves. An inability to hire and retain personnel, especially in light of the CARES Act limitations, as well as due to high rates of infection among employees, timely secure the required equipment and facilities in a cost-effective manner, efficiently operate our expanded facilities or obtain the necessary regulatory approvals may adversely affect our ability to achieve our growth strategy, which could harm our business. Furthermore, expansion to new \n44\n\n\nTable of Contents\nmarkets may have other risks due to factors specific to those markets. We may be unable to foresee all of the existing risks upon entering certain new markets or respond adequately to these risks, and our growth strategy and our business may suffer as a result. In addition, our competitors may reduce their fares and/or offer special promotions following our entry into a new market and may also offer more attractive frequent flyer programs and/or access to marketing alliances with other airlines, which we do not currently offer. We cannot assure that we will be able to profitably expand our existing markets or establish new markets.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has materially disrupted and continues to disrupt our strategic operating and growth plans in the near-term, and there are risks to our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition associated with executing our strategic operating and growth plans in the long-term.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has materially disrupted and continues to disrupt our strategic operating and growth plans in the near-term, and there are risks to our business, operating results and financial condition associated with executing our strategic operating and growth plans in the long-term. In developing our strategic operating and growth plans, we make certain assumptions, including, but not limited to, those related to customer demand, competition, staffing and hiring, market consolidation, the availability of aircraft and the global economy. Actual economic, market and other conditions have been and may continue to be different from our assumptions. If we do not successfully execute or adjust our strategic operating and growth plans in the long-term, or if actual results continue to vary significantly from our prior assumptions or vary significantly from our future assumptions, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted.\nOur cargo business is concentrated with Amazon, and any decrease in volumes or increase in costs, or a termination of the ATSA\n,\n \ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and brand.\nFor the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2021, cargo revenue under the ATSA represented 15% of our total operating revenues and our cargo revenue consisted entirely of air cargo transportation services provided to Amazon under the ATSA. The ATSA does not require a minimum amount of flying and Amazon is permitted to decrease flying volume at any time. Our cargo business would decline if Amazon\u2019s use of our cargo services decreases for any reason, including due to general economic conditions or preferences of Amazon and its customers, which a decline would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nIn addition, the profitability of the ATSA is dependent on our ability to manage and accurately predict costs. Our projections of operating costs, crew productivity and maintenance expenses contain key assumptions, including flight hours, aircraft reliability, crewmember productivity, compensation and benefits and maintenance costs. If actual costs are higher than projected or aircraft reliability is less than expected, or aircraft become damaged and are out of revenue service for repair, the profitability of the ATSA and future operating results may be negatively impacted. We rely on flight crews that are unionized. If collective bargaining agreements increase our costs and we cannot recover such increases, our operating results would be negatively impacted. It may be necessary for us to terminate certain customer contracts or curtail planned growth.\nPerformance under the ATSA is subject to a number of challenges and uncertainties, such as: unforeseen maintenance and other costs; our ability to hire pilots, crew and other personnel necessary to support our CMI services; interruptions in the operations under the ATSA as a result of unexpected or unforeseen events, whether as a result of factors within the Company\u2019s control or outside of the Company\u2019s control; and the level of operations and results of operations, including margins, under the ATSA being less than the Company\u2019s current expectations and projections. The ATSA also contains\u00a0monthly incentive payments for reaching specific on-time arrival performance thresholds and there are monetary penalties for on-time arrival performance below certain thresholds. As a result, our operating revenues may vary from period to period depending on the achievement of\u00a0monthly incentives or the imposition of penalties. Further, we could be found in default if we do not maintain certain minimum thresholds over an extended period of time. If we are placed in default due to the failure to maintain reliability thresholds, Amazon may elect to terminate all or part of the services we provide after a cure period and pursue those rights and remedies available to it at law or in equity, in which case the \n45\n\n\nTable of Contents\n2019 Warrants would remain outstanding. Amazon may also terminate the ATSA for convenience, subject to certain notice requirements and payment of a termination fee. The ATSA is also subject to two, two-year extension options, which Amazon may choose not to exercise.\nTo the extent our volume of flying for Amazon decreases or costs associated with our cargo business increase, or if the ATSA is terminated for any reason, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur low-cost structure is one of our primary competitive advantages, and many factors could affect our ability to control our costs.\nOur low-cost structure is one of our primary competitive advantages. However, we have limited control over many of our costs. For example, we have limited control over the price and availability of aircraft fuel, aviation insurance, the acquisition and cost of aircraft, airport and related infrastructure costs, taxes, the cost of meeting changing regulatory requirements, the cost of capable talent at market wages and our cost to access capital or financing. In addition, the compensation and benefit costs applicable to a significant portion of our employees are established by the terms of collective bargaining agreements. See \u201c\u2014Risks Related to Our Business\u2014Increased labor costs, union disputes, employee strikes and other labor-related disruption may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\u201d We cannot guarantee we will be able to maintain our relatively low costs. If our cost structure increases and we are no longer able to maintain a competitive cost structure, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is significantly tied to and consolidated in our main hub in Minneapolis-St. Paul, and any decrease in traffic in this hub could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and brand.\nOur service is concentrated around our hub in MSP and our business is impacted by economic and geophysical factors of this region. We maintain a large presence in MSP with approximately 89% of 2021 capacity, as measured by ASMs, having MSP as either their origin or destination. Flight operations in Minneapolis can face extreme weather challenges in all seasons, but especially in the winter which at times has resulted in severe disruptions in our operation and the incurrence of material costs as a consequence of such disruptions. Our business could be further harmed by an increase in the amount of direct competition we face in the Minneapolis market or by continued or increased congestion, delays or cancellations. For instance, MSP is also a significant hub for Delta Air Lines. If Delta Air Lines or another legacy network airline were to successfully develop low-cost or low-fare products or if we were to experience increased competition from LCCs or ULCCs in the Minneapolis market, our business, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business would also be negatively impacted by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for air transportation in the Minneapolis area, such as adverse changes in local economic conditions, local regulations and/or mandates, health concerns, adverse weather conditions, negative public perception of Minneapolis, riots, social unrest, terrorist attacks or significant price or tax increases linked to increases in airport access costs and fees imposed on passengers.\nWe currently operate out of Terminal 2 at MSP. Our access to use our existing gates and other facilities in Terminal 2 is not guaranteed. We cannot assure you that our continued use of our facilities at MSP will occur on acceptable terms with respect to operations and cost of operations, or at all, or that our ongoing use of these facilities will not include additional or increased fees.\nOur reputation and business could be adversely affected in the event of an accident or similar public incident involving our aircraft or personnel.\nWe are exposed to potential significant losses and adverse publicity in the event that any of our aircraft or personnel is involved in an accident, terrorist incident or other similar public incident, which could expose us to significant reputational harm and potential legal liability. In addition, we could face significant costs related to \n46\n\n\nTable of Contents\nrepairs or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its temporary or permanent loss from service. Furthermore, our customers, including Amazon, may choose not to use us for their needs following such an incident. We cannot assure you that we will not be affected by such events or that the amount of our insurance coverage will be adequate in the event such circumstances arise and any such event could cause a substantial increase in our insurance premiums. In addition, any future accident or similar incident involving our aircraft or personnel, even if fully covered by insurance or even if it does not involve our airline, may create an adverse public perception about our airline or that the equipment we fly is less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives, or, in the case of our aircraft, could cause us to perform time-consuming and costly inspections on our aircraft or engines, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, any accident involving the Boeing 737-NG or an aircraft similar to the Boeing 737-NG that we operate could result in the curtailment of such aircraft by aviation regulators, manufacturers and other airlines and could create a negative public perception about the safety of our aircraft, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, in 2019, certain global aviation regulators and airlines grounded the Boeing 737 MAX in response to accidents involving aircraft flown by Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines. In addition, following a 2018 accident involving the failure of a turbofan on a 737-700 aircraft, the National Transportation Safety Board, or NTSB, has recommended that regulators require Boeing to redesign the engine cowl on 737-NG aircraft and retrofit in service 737-NG aircraft with the redesigned cowl. We cannot predict when the FAA will respond to the NTSB recommendations and if it will require us to replace the engine cowls in our aircraft, which may be time-consuming and costly. The resolution of this matter or similar matters in the future could have an impact on our results of operations, financial condition, business and prospects.\nUnauthorized use, incursion or breach of our information technology infrastructure,\n \nor that of our third party providers,\n \ncould compromise the personally identifiable information of our passengers, prospective passengers or personnel and other sensitive information and expose us to liability, damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn the processing of our customer transactions and as part of our ordinary business operations, we and certain of our third-party providers collect, process, transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information, including email addresses and home addresses and financial data such as credit and debit card information. This data is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation, such as the Fair Accurate Credit Transparency Act, Payment Card Industry legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act and the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation typically intended to protect the privacy of personal data that is collected, processed, stored and transmitted. The security of the systems and network where we and our third-party providers store this data is a critical element of our business, and these systems and our network may be vulnerable to theft, loss, damage and interruption from a number of potential sources and events, including computer viruses, hackers, enemy state actors, denial-of-service attacks, employee theft or misuse, natural or man-made disasters, telecommunications failures, power loss and other disruptive sources and events.\nAdditionally, any material failure by us or our third-party providers to maintain compliance with the Payment Card Industry security requirements or to rectify a data security issue may result in fines and restrictions on our ability to accept credit and debit cards as a form of payment. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees and engage third-party experts and consultants, or costs incurred in connection with the notifications to customers, employees, providers or the general public as part of our notification obligations to the various governments that govern our business. In addition, data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including breaches by us or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. \nWe are subject to increasing legislative, regulatory and customer focus on privacy issues and data security in the United States and abroad. In addition, a number of our commercial partners, including credit card \n47\n\n\nTable of Contents\ncompanies, have imposed data security standards on us, and these standards continue to evolve. We will continue our efforts to meet our privacy and data security obligations; however, it is possible that certain new obligations may be difficult to meet and could increase our costs. Additionally, we must manage evolving cybersecurity risks. The loss, disclosure, misappropriation of or access to the information of our customers, personnel or business partners or any failure by us to meet our obligations could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties.\nAs the cyber-threat landscape evolves, attacks are growing in frequency, sophistication, and intensity, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. We have in the past, and may in the future, experience such cybersecurity threats.\n \nWe and the vendors who service us may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber attacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our customers (including the U.S. Department of Defense) and our providers, including air navigation service providers, or others who have entrusted us with information, including regulators such as the U.S. Department of Defense, FAA and DOT. In addition, attacks not targeted at us, but targeted solely at providers, may cause disruption to our computer systems or a breach of the data that we maintain on customers, employees, providers and others. Recently, several high profile consumer-oriented companies have experienced significant data breaches, which have caused those companies to suffer substantial financial and reputational harm. We cannot assure you that the precautions we have taken to avoid an unauthorized incursion of our computer systems are either adequate or implemented properly to prevent a data breach and its adverse financial and reputational consequences to our business.\nA significant cybersecurity incident could result in a range of potentially material negative consequences for us, including lost revenue; unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss or destruction of company systems or data; theft of sensitive, regulated or confidential data, such as personal identifying information or our intellectual property; the loss of functionality of critical systems through ransomware, denial of service or other attacks; and business delays, service or system disruptions, damage to equipment and injury to persons or property. The costs and operational consequences of defending against, preparing for, responding to and remediating an incident may be substantial. Further, we could be exposed to litigation, regulatory enforcement or other legal action as a result of an incident, carrying the potential for damages, fines, sanctions or other penalties, as well as injunctive relief requiring costly compliance measures. A cybersecurity incident could also impact our brand, harm our reputation and adversely impact our relationship with our customers, employees and stockholders.\nWe rely on third-party providers and other commercial partners to perform functions integral to our operations.\nWe have entered into agreements with third-party providers to furnish certain facilities and services required for our operations, including ground handling, catering, passenger handling, engineering, maintenance, refueling, reservations and airport facilities as well as administrative and support services. We are likely to enter into similar service agreements in new markets we decide to enter, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the necessary services at acceptable rates, or that such third-party providers will be available to service us.\nAlthough we seek to monitor the performance of third parties that furnish certain facilities or provide us with our ground handling, catering, passenger handling, engineering, maintenance, refueling, reservations and airport facilities, the efficiency, timeliness and quality of contract performance by third-party providers are often beyond our control, and any failure by our third-party providers to perform up to our expectations, or sufficiently staff their operation, may have an adverse impact on our business, reputation with customers, our brand and our operations. These service agreements are generally subject to termination after notice by the third-party providers. In addition, we could experience a significant business disruption if we were to change vendors or if an existing provider ceased to be able to serve us. We expect to be dependent on such third-party arrangements for the foreseeable future.\n48\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe rely on third-party distribution channels to distribute a portion of our airline tickets.\nWe rely on third-party distribution channels, including those provided by or through global distribution systems, or GDSs, conventional travel agents and online travel agents, or OTAs, to distribute a significant portion of our airline tickets, and we expect in the future to rely on these channels to also collect a portion of our ancillary revenues. These distribution channels are more expensive and at present have less functionality in respect of ancillary revenues than those we operate ourselves, such as our website. Certain of these distribution channels also effectively restrict the manner in which we distribute our products generally. To remain competitive, we will need to successfully manage our distribution costs and rights, and improve the functionality of third-party distribution channels, while maintaining an industry-competitive cost structure. Negotiations with key GDSs and OTAs designed to manage our costs, increase our distribution flexibility, and improve functionality could be contentious, could result in diminished or less favorable distribution of our tickets, and may not provide the functionality we require to maximize ancillary revenues. In addition, in the last several\u00a0years there has been significant consolidation among GDSs and OTAs. This consolidation and any further consolidation could affect our ability to manage our distribution costs due to a reduction in competition or other industry factors. Any inability to manage such costs, rights and functionality at a competitive level or any material diminishment in the distribution of our tickets could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position and our results of operations. Moreover, our ability to compete in the markets we serve may be threatened by changes in technology or other factors that may make our existing third-party sales channels impractical, uncompetitive or obsolete.\nWe rely heavily on technology and automated systems to operate our business, and any disruptions or failure of these technologies or systems or any failure on our part to implement any new technologies or systems could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are highly dependent on technology and computer systems and networks to operate our business. These technologies and systems include our computerized airline reservation system provided by \nNavitaire\n, a unit of Amadeus, flight operations systems, telecommunications systems, mobile phone application, airline website and maintenance systems. In order for our operations to work efficiently, our website and reservation system must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic, maintain secure information and deliver flight information. Our reservations system, which is hosted and maintained under a long-term contract by a third-party provider, is critical to our ability to issue, track and accept electronic tickets, conduct check-in, board and manage our passengers through the airports we serve and provide us with access to GDSs, which enlarge our pool of potential passengers. There are many instances in the past where a reservations system malfunctioned, whether due to the fault of the system provider or the airline, with a highly adverse effect on the airline\u2019s operations, and such a malfunction has in the past and could in the future occur on our system, or in connection with any system upgrade or migration in the future. We also rely on third-party providers to maintain our flight operations systems, and if those systems are not functioning, we have in the past and may again experience service disruptions, which could result in the loss of important data, increase our expenses, decrease our operational performance and temporarily stall our operations, which may have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operation, and financial condition.\nAny failure of the technologies and systems we use could materially adversely affect our business. In particular, if our reservation system fails or experiences interruptions, and we are unable to book seats for a period of time, we could lose a significant amount of revenue as customers book seats on other airlines, and our reputation could be harmed. Additionally, if our flight systems fail or experience disruption, we could incur costs associated with cancelled and delayed flights. In addition, replacement technologies and systems for any service we currently utilize that experiences failures or interruptions may not be readily available on a timely basis, at competitive rates or at all. Furthermore, our current technologies and systems are heavily integrated with our day-to-day operations and any transition to a new technology or system could be complex and time-consuming. Our technologies and systems cannot be completely protected against events that are beyond our control, including natural disasters, cyber attacks or telecommunications failures. We recently experienced a software outage that resulted in delayed flights for several hours, which could impact our on-time performance and completion factor. Substantial or sustained disruptions or system failures could cause service delays or \n49\n\n\nTable of Contents\nfailures and result in our customers purchasing tickets from other airlines. We cannot assure that any of our security measures, change control procedures or disaster recovery plans that we have implemented are adequate to prevent disruptions or failures. In the event that one or more of our primary technology or systems vendors fails to perform and a replacement system is not available or if we fail to implement a replacement system in a timely and efficient manner, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of business, our systems will continue to require modification and refinements to address growth and changing business requirements and to enable us to comply with changing regulatory requirements. Modifications and refinements to our systems have been and are expected to continue to be expensive to implement and can divert management\u2019s attention from other matters. Furthermore, our operations could be adversely affected, or we could face impositions of regulatory penalties, if we were unable to timely or effectively modify our systems as necessary or appropriately balance the introduction of new capabilities with the management of existing systems.\nWe may not be able to grow or maintain our unit revenues or maintain our ancillary revenues.\nA key component of our strategy was establishing Sun Country as a premier high-growth, low-cost carrier in the United States by attracting customers with low fares and garnering repeat business by delivering a high-quality customer experience with additional free amenities than traditionally provided on ULCCs in the United States. We intend to continue to differentiate our brand and product in order to expand our loyal customer base and grow or maintain our unit revenues and maintain our ancillary revenues. Differentiating our brand and product has required and will continue to require significant investment, and we cannot assure that the initiatives we have implemented will continue to be successful or that the initiatives we intend to implement will be successful. If we are unable to maintain or further differentiate our brand and product from LCCs or ULCCs, our market share could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may also not be successful in leveraging our brand and product to stimulate new demand with low base fares or gain market share from the legacy network airlines.\nIn addition, our business strategy includes maintaining our portfolio of desirable, value-oriented, ancillary products and services. However, we cannot assure you that passengers will continue to perceive value in the ancillary products and services we currently offer and regulatory initiatives could adversely affect ancillary revenue opportunities. Failure to maintain our ancillary revenues would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, if we are unable to maintain our ancillary revenues, we may not be able to execute our strategy to continue to lower base fares in order to stimulate demand for air travel.\nWe operate a single aircraft type.\nA critical cost-saving element of our business strategy is to operate a single-family aircraft fleet; however, our dependence on the Boeing 737-NG aircraft and CFM56 engines for all of our aircraft makes us vulnerable to any design defects or mechanical problems associated with this aircraft type or these engines. In the event of any actual or suspected design defects or mechanical problems with these family aircraft or engines, whether involving our aircraft or that of another airline, we may choose or be required to suspend or restrict the use of our aircraft. For example, several Boeing 737-NG aircraft have been grounded in the past by other airlines after inspections revealed cracks in the \u201cpickle forks,\u201d a component of the structure connecting the wings to the fuselages. Our business could also be materially adversely affected if the public avoids flying on our aircraft due to an adverse perception of the Boeing 737-NG aircraft or CFM56 engines, whether because of safety concerns or other problems, real or perceived, or in the event of an accident involving such aircraft or engines.\n50\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIncreased labor costs, union disputes, employee strikes and other labor-related disruption may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is labor intensive, with labor costs representing approximately 34.5%, 36.9% and 22.6% of our total operating costs for the\u00a0years ended December\u00a031, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December\u00a031, 2021, approximately 46.3% of our workforce was represented by labor unions. We cannot assure you that our labor costs going forward will remain competitive or that any new agreements into which we enter will not have terms with higher labor costs or that the negotiations of such labor agreements will not result in any work stoppages. In addition, one or more of our competitors may significantly reduce their labor costs, thereby providing them with a competitive advantage over us. New entrants to the market may not have unionized workforces and therefore may have substantially lower costs or better labor efficiencies. Furthermore, our labor costs may increase in connection with our growth, especially if we needed to hire more pilots in order to grow our cargo business. We cannot guarantee that our cargo business will grow and that hiring of additional pilots will be required. We may also become subject to additional collective bargaining agreements in the future as non-unionized workers may unionize.\nRelations between air carriers and labor unions in the United States are governed by the Railway Labor Act, or the RLA. Under the RLA, collective bargaining agreements generally contain \u201camendable dates\u201d rather than expiration dates, and the RLA requires that a carrier maintain the existing terms and conditions of employment following the amendable date through a multi-stage and usually lengthy series of bargaining processes overseen by the National Mediation Board, or the NMB. This process continues until either the parties have reached agreement on a new collective bargaining agreement, or the parties have been released to \u201cself-help\u201d by the NMB. In most circumstances, the RLA prohibits strikes; however, after release by the NMB, carriers and unions are free to engage in self-help measures such as lockouts and strikes.\nOn December\u00a03, 2019 our dispatchers approved a new contract. The amendable date of the collective bargaining agreement is November\u00a014, 2024. Our collective bargaining agreement with our flight attendants is currently amendable. Negotiations with the union representing this group commenced in November\u00a0of 2019. By mutual consent, the negotiations were paused in March\u00a02020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We restarted negotiations in October\u00a0of 2021. Our collective bargaining agreement with our pilots is amendable on December\u00a031, 2026. See also \u201cBusiness\u2014Employees\u201d in this Annual Report. The outcome of our collective bargaining negotiations cannot presently be determined and the terms and conditions of our future collective bargaining agreements may be affected by the results of collective bargaining negotiations at other airlines that may have a greater ability, due to larger scale, greater efficiency or other factors, to bear higher costs than we can. In addition, if we are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups in current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements, we may be subject to work interruptions, stoppages\u00a0or shortages. Any such action or other labor dispute with unionized employees could disrupt our operations, reduce our profitability or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies. As a result, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected based on the outcome of our negotiations with the unions representing our employees.\n51\n\n\nTable of Contents\nChanges in law, regulation and government policy have affected, and may in the future have a material adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in, and uncertainty with respect to, law, regulation and government policy at the local, state or federal level have affected, and may in the future significantly impact, our business and the airline industry. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December\u00a022, 2017, limits deductions for borrowers for net interest expense on debt. Changes to law, regulations or government policy that could have a material impact on us in the future include, but are not limited to, infrastructure renewal programs; changes to operating and maintenance requirements; foreign and domestic changes in customs, immigration and security policy and requirements that impede travel into or out of the United States; modifications to international trade policy, including withdrawing from trade agreements and imposing tariffs; changes to consumer protection laws; changes to public health policy; changes to financial legislation, including the partial or full repeal of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or Dodd-Frank Act; public company reporting requirements; environmental regulation and antitrust enforcement. Any such changes could make it more difficult and/or more expensive for us to obtain new aircraft or engines and parts to maintain existing aircraft or engines or make it less profitable or prevent us from flying to or from some of the destinations we currently serve.\nTo the extent that any such changes have a negative impact on us or the airline industry, including as a result of related uncertainty, these changes may materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe rely on efficient daily aircraft utilization to address peak demand\u00a0days of the week and\u00a0months of the\u00a0year, which makes us vulnerable to flight delays, flight cancellations or aircraft unavailability during peak demand periods.\nWe aim to optimize our daily aircraft utilization rate by tailoring service to customer demand patterns, which are seasonal and vary by day of the week. Our average daily aircraft utilization was 6.8 hours, 5.1 hours and 9.6 hours for the\u00a0years ended December\u00a031, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Aircraft utilization is block hours divided by number of\u00a0days in the period divided by average aircraft. Part\u00a0of our business strategy is to efficiently deploy our aircraft, which is achieved in part by higher utilization during the most profitable seasonal periods and\u00a0days of the week and more limited usage of less expensive aircraft during weak demand periods. During peak demand periods, we may utilize all of our aircraft, and in the event we experience delays and cancellations from various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including air traffic congestion at airports or other air traffic control problems or outages, adverse weather conditions, increased security measures or breaches in security, international or domestic conflicts, terrorist activity, or other changes in business conditions, because we do not have accommodation arrangements with other airlines like legacy network airlines do and cannot reaccommodate passengers on our aircraft because of our limited schedule, we may incur additional costs in completing customer journeys. Due to the relatively small size of our fleet and the limited and changing nature of our scheduled service and our point-to-point network, the unexpected unavailability of one or more aircraft and resulting reduced capacity could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, we frequently use all of our freighters in support of our cargo business. In the event we experience a series of aircraft out of service, we would experience a decline in revenue and potentially customer satisfaction. Furthermore, in the event we are unable to procure aircraft at the price-point necessary to allow for lower utilization during weak demand periods, our costs will be higher and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe cost of aircraft repairs and unexpected delays in the time required to complete aircraft maintenance could negatively affect our operating results.\nWe provide flight services throughout the world and could be operating in remote regions. Our aircraft may experience maintenance events in locations that do not have the necessary repair capabilities or are difficult to reach. As a result, we may incur additional expenses and lose billable revenues that we would have otherwise earned. Under certain customer agreements, we are required to provide a spare aircraft while scheduled \n52\n\n\nTable of Contents\nmaintenance is completed. If delays occur in the completion of aircraft maintenance, we may incur additional expense to provide airlift capacity and forgo revenues.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel at reasonable costs or fail to maintain our company culture, our business could be harmed.\nOur business is labor intensive. We require large numbers of pilots, flight attendants, maintenance technicians and other personnel. We compete against other U.S. airlines for pilots, mechanics and other skilled labor and certain U.S. airlines offer wage and benefit packages exceeding ours. The airline industry has from time to time experienced a shortage of qualified personnel. In particular, as more pilots in the industry approach mandatory retirement age, or have retired early during the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. airline industry may be affected by a pilot shortage. We and other airlines may also face shortages of qualified aircraft mechanics and dispatchers. As is common with most of our competitors, we have faced turnover of our employees. As a result of the foregoing, we may not be able to attract or retain qualified personnel or may be required to increase wages and/or benefits in order to do so. In addition, we may lose employees due to the impact of COVID-19 on aviation or as a result of restrictions imposed under the CARES Act, or other governmental requirements placed on employees, which may further impede our ability to attract and retain skilled labor. If we are unable to hire, train and retain qualified employees, our business could be harmed and we may be unable to implement our growth plans.\nIn addition, as we hire more people and grow, we believe it may be increasingly challenging to continue to hire people who will maintain our company culture. Our company culture, which we believe is one of our competitive strengths, is important to providing dependable customer service and having a productive, accountable workforce that helps keep our costs low. As we continue to grow, we may be unable to identify, hire or retain enough people who meet the above criteria, including those in management or other key positions. Our company culture could otherwise be adversely affected by our growing operations and geographic diversity. If we fail to maintain the strength of our company culture, our competitive ability and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur inability to expand or operate reliably or efficiently out of airports where we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and brand.\nOur results of operations may be affected by actions taken by governmental or other agencies or authorities having jurisdiction over our operations at these airports, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nincreases in airport rates and charges;\n\u25cf\nlimitations on take-off and landing slots, airport gate capacity or other use of airport facilities;\n\u25cf\ntermination of our airport use agreements, some of which can be terminated by airport authorities with little notice to us;\n\u25cf\nincreases in airport capacity that could facilitate increased competition;\n\u25cf\ninternational travel regulations such as customs and immigration;\n\u25cf\nincreases in taxes;\n\u25cf\nchanges in law, regulations and government policies that affect the services that can be offered by airlines, in general, and in particular markets and at particular airports;\n\u25cf\nrestrictions on competitive practices;\n\u25cf\nchanges in law or ordinances that increase minimum wages beyond regional norms;\n53\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u25cf\nthe adoption of statutes or regulations that impact or impose additional customer service standards and requirements, including operating and security standards and requirements; and\n\u25cf\nthe adoption of more restrictive locally imposed noise regulations or curfews.\nOur business is highly dependent on the availability and cost of airport services at the airports where we operate. Any changes in airport operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to various environmental and noise laws and regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to increasingly stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment and noise, including those relating to emissions to the air (including air emissions associated with the operation of our aircraft), discharges (including storm water discharges) to surface and subsurface waters, safe drinking water and the use, management, disposal and release of, and exposure to, hazardous substances, oils and waste materials. We are or may be subject to new or amended laws and regulations that may have a direct effect (or indirect effect through our third-party providers, including the petroleum industry, or airport facilities at which we operate) on our operations. In addition, U.S. airport authorities are exploring ways to limit de-icing fluid discharges. Any such existing, future, new or potential laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSimilarly, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations that require us to investigate and remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain remediation standards. Under certain laws current and former owners or operators of facilities, as well as generators of waste materials disposed of at such facilities, can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at facilities that have been identified as requiring response actions. Liability under these laws may be strict, joint and several, meaning that we could be liable for the costs of cleaning up environmental contamination regardless of fault or compliance with applicable law when the disposal occurred or the amount of wastes directly attributable to us.\nIn addition, the ICAO and jurisdictions around the world have adopted noise regulations that require all aircraft to comply with noise level standards, and governmental authorities in several U.S. and foreign cities are considering or have already implemented aircraft noise reduction programs, including the imposition of overnight curfews and limitations on daytime take-offs and landings. Compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations, including emissions limitations and more restrictive or widespread noise regulations, that may be applicable to us could require significant expenditures, increase our cost base and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and violations thereof can lead to significant fines and penalties, among other sanctions.\nWe participate with other airlines in fuel consortia and fuel committees at our airports where economically beneficial, which agreements generally include cost-sharing provisions and environmental indemnities that are generally joint and several among the participating airlines. Any costs (including remediation and spill response costs) incurred by such fuel consortia could also have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur intellectual property rights, particularly our branding rights, are valuable, and any inability to protect them may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe consider our intellectual property rights, particularly our branding rights such as our trademarks applicable to our airline and Sun Country Rewards program, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. We aim to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark, copyright and other forms of legal protection, contractual agreements and policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property, but cannot guarantee that such efforts will be successful. Our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property or any change in law that lessens or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property \n54\n\n\nTable of Contents\nmay diminish our competitiveness and adversely affect our business and financial results. Any litigation or disputes regarding intellectual property may be costly and time-consuming and may divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, either of which may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nNegative publicity regarding our customer service could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business strategy includes the differentiation of our brand and product from the other U.S. airlines, including LCCs and ULCCs, in order to increase customer loyalty and drive future ticket sales. We intend to accomplish this by continuing to offer passengers dependable customer service. However, in the past, we have experienced customer complaints related to, among other things, product and pricing changes related to our business strategy and customer service. In particular, we have generally experienced a higher volume of complaints when we implemented changes to our unbundling policies, such as charging for seats and baggage. These complaints, together with reports of lost baggage, delayed and cancelled flights, and other service issues, are reported to the public by the DOT. In addition, we could become subject to complaints about our booking practices. Finally, we have experienced a significant number of complaints, including letters from lawmakers and attorneys general, concerning non-refundable tickets during the COVID-19 pandemic. If we do not meet our customers\u2019 expectations with respect to reliability and service, our brand and product could be negatively impacted, which could result in customers deciding not to fly with us and adversely affect our business and reputation. We have agreements for bus and car service to transport passengers to our MSP hub. If these operators suffer a service problem, safety failure or accident, our brand would be negatively impacted.\nOur reputation and brand could be harmed if we were to experience significant negative publicity, including through social media.\nWe operate in a public-facing industry with significant exposure to social media. Negative publicity, whether or not justified, can spread rapidly through social media. In particular, passengers can use social media to portray interactions with Sun Country, without context, in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated. To the extent that we are unable to respond timely and appropriately to negative publicity, our reputation and brand can be harmed. Damage to our overall reputation and brand could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nWe are highly dependent upon our cash balances, operating cash flows and availability under our Credit Facilities.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and availability under our $25,000 Revolving Credit Facility and $90,000 Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility. Our Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility is available only to finance the acquisition of aircraft and engines and is not available for working capital or other general corporate purposes. In 2021, we borrowed $80,500 under the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility for the purpose of financing the acquisition of six additional aircraft that we previously leased, all of which have been acquired. We are and will continue to be dependent on our operating cash flows and cash balances to fund our operations, provide capital reserves and make scheduled payments on our aircraft-related fixed obligations. If our operating cash flows become insufficient to cover the entirety of our cash outflows, the Revolving Credit Facility may not be adequate to finance our operations. If we fail to generate sufficient funds from operations to meet our operating cash requirements or do not have access to availability under the Revolving Credit Facility, or other sources of borrowings or equity financing, we could default on our operating leases and fixed obligations. Our inability to meet our obligations as they become due would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \n55\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur liquidity would be adversely impacted, potentially materially, in the event one or more of our credit card processors were to impose holdback restrictions for payments due to us from credit card transactions.\nWe currently have agreements with organizations that process credit card transactions arising from purchases of air travel tickets by our customers. Credit card processors may have financial risk associated with tickets purchased for travel which can occur several weeks or\u00a0months after the purchase. As of December\u00a031, 2021, we were not subject to any credit card holdbacks under our credit card processing agreements, although if we fail to meet certain liquidity and other financial covenants, our credit card processors have the right to hold back credit card remittances to cover our obligations to them. If our credit card processors were to impose holdback restrictions on us, the negative impact on our liquidity could be significant which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to obtain financing or access capital markets may be limited.\nWe have significant obligations related to leases and debt financing for our aircraft fleet and may incur additional obligations as we grow our operations, and our current strategy is to rely on lessors or access to capital markets to provide financing for our aircraft acquisition needs. There are a number of factors that may affect our ability to raise financing or access the capital markets in the future, including our liquidity and credit status, our operating cash flows, market conditions in the airline industry, U.S. and global economic conditions, the general state of the capital markets and the financial position of the major providers of commercial aircraft financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to source external financing for our planned aircraft acquisitions or for other significant capital needs, and if we are unable to source financing on acceptable terms, or unable to source financing at all, our business could be materially adversely affected. To the extent we finance our activities with additional debt, we may become subject to financial and other covenants that may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategy or otherwise constrain our growth and operations.\nOur maintenance costs will fluctuate over time; additionally we will periodically incur substantial maintenance costs due to the maintenance schedules of our aircraft fleet and obligations to the lessors, and we could incur significant maintenance expenses outside of such maintenance schedules in the future.\nWe have substantial maintenance expense obligations, including with respect to our aircraft operating leases. Prior to an aircraft being returned in connection with an operating lease, we will incur costs to restore these aircraft to the condition required by the terms of the underlying operating leases. The amount and timing of these so-called \u201creturn conditions\u201d costs can prove unpredictable due to uncertainty regarding the maintenance status of each particular aircraft at the time it is to be returned and it is not unusual for disagreements to ensue between the airline and the leasing company as to the required redelivery conditions on a given aircraft or engine.\nOutside of scheduled maintenance, we incur from time to time unscheduled maintenance which is not forecast in our operating plan or financial forecasts, and which can impose material unplanned costs and the loss of flight equipment from revenue service for a significant period of time. For example, a single unplanned engine event can require a shop visit costing several million dollars and cause the engine to be out of service for a number of weeks.\nFurthermore, the terms of our lease agreements require us to pay maintenance reserves to the lessor in advance of the performance of major maintenance, resulting in our recording significant prepaid deposits on our balance sheet, and there are restrictions on the extent to which such maintenance reserves are available for reimbursement. In addition, the terms of any lease agreements that we enter into in the future could also require maintenance reserves in excess of our current requirements. Any significant increase in maintenance and repair expenses would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Please see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Operating Expenses\u2014Maintenance.\u201d\n56\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe have a significant amount of aircraft and other fixed obligations that could impair our liquidity and thereby harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe airline business is capital intensive. As of December 31, 2021, our 36 passenger aircraft fleet consisted of six aircraft financed under operating leases, nine aircraft financed under finance leases and nineteen aircraft financed under secured debt arrangements or owned outright. As of December 31, 2021, we had future operating lease obligations of $81,900, future debt principal obligations of $280,931, and future finance lease obligations of $250,654. During 2022, based on our aircraft leases and debt structure as of December 31, 2021, we expect to make payments of $20,541 related to operating leases, $30,367 related to debt principal obligations and $23,052 related to finance lease obligations. Additionally, we made payments for maintenance reserves of $15,073 for 2021 and expect to make significant payments for maintenance reserves in the future. Our ability to pay the fixed costs associated with our contractual obligations will depend on our operating performance, cash flow, availability under the Revolving Credit Facility and our ability to secure adequate future financing, which will in turn depend on, among other things, the success of our current business strategy and our future financial and operating performance, competitive conditions, fuel price volatility, any significant weakening or improving in the U.S. economy, availability and cost of financing, as well as general economic and political conditions and other factors that are, to some extent, beyond our control. The amount of our aircraft-related fixed obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and could:\n\u25cf\nrequire a substantial portion of cash flow from operations be used for operating lease and maintenance deposit payments and interest expense, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing to support our expansion plans and for working capital and other purposes on acceptable terms or at all;\n\u25cf\nmake it more difficult for us to pay our other obligations as they become due during adverse general economic and market industry conditions because any related decrease in revenues could cause us to not have sufficient cash flows from operations to make our scheduled payments;\n\u25cf\nreduce our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the airline industry and, consequently, place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors with lower fixed payment obligations; and\n\u25cf\ncause us to lose access to one or more aircraft and forfeit our maintenance and other deposits if we are unable to make our required aircraft lease rental payments and our lessors exercise their remedies under the lease agreement, including cross-default provisions in certain of our leases.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient funds to enable us to repay or refinance our debt obligations on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. A failure to pay our operating lease, debt and other fixed cost obligations or a breach of our contractual obligations, including the Credit Agreement, could result in a variety of adverse consequences, including the exercise of remedies by our creditors and lessors. In such a situation, it is unlikely that we would be able to cure our breach, fulfill our obligations, make required lease payments or otherwise cover our fixed costs and our secured lenders could foreclose against the assets securing the indebtedness owing to them, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on a sole-source supplier for the majority of our aircraft parts and any supply disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have entered into a contract with Delta Air Lines,\u00a0Inc., or Delta, one of our competitors that is also the largest airline operating at MSP, for the vast majority of our aircraft parts. We are vulnerable to any problems associated with the performance of Delta\u2019s obligations to supply our aircraft parts, including design defects, \n57\n\n\nTable of Contents\nmechanical problems and regulatory issues associated with engines and other parts. If Delta experiences a significant business challenge, disruption or failure due to issues such as financial difficulties or bankruptcy, regulatory or quality compliance issues, or other financial, legal, regulatory or reputational issues, ceases to produce our aircraft parts, is unable to effectively deliver our aircraft parts on timelines and at the prices we have negotiated, or terminates the contract, we would incur substantial transition costs and we would lose the cost benefits from our current arrangement with Delta, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nReduction in demand for air transportation, or governmental reduction or limitation of operating capacity, in the domestic United States, Canada, Mexico or Caribbean markets, or a reduction in demand for our charter or cargo operations, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA significant portion of our operations are conducted to and from the domestic United States, Canada, Mexico or Caribbean markets. Our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we lose our authority to fly to these markets, by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for air transportation, or by governmental reduction or limitation of operating capacity, in these markets, such as adverse changes in local economic or political conditions, public health restrictions, including testing or vaccination requirements associated with COVID-19, negative public perception of these destinations, unfavorable weather conditions, public health concerns, civil unrest, violence or terrorist-related activities. Furthermore, our business could be harmed if jurisdictions that currently limit competition allow additional airlines to compete on routes we serve. In addition, a reduction in demand from our charter customers, including as a result of decreased U.S. Department of Defense troop movements or fewer sports events and related travel, or from Amazon under the ATSA could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by the FAA, the DOT, the TSA, CBP and other U.S. and foreign governmental agencies, compliance with which could cause us to incur increased costs and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAirlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements, both domestically and internationally, that impose significant costs. In the last several\u00a0years, Congress has passed laws and the FAA, DOT and TSA have issued regulations, orders, rulings and guidance relating to consumer protections and to the operation, safety, and security of airlines that have required significant expenditures. We expect to continue to incur expenses in connection with complying with such laws and government regulations, orders, rulings and guidance. Additional laws, regulations, taxes and increased airport rates and charges have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel. For example, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 directed the FAA to issue rules\u00a0establishing minimum dimensions for passenger seats, including seat pitch, width and length. If adopted, these measures could have the effect of raising ticket prices, reducing revenue, and increasing costs.\nFor example, the DOT has broad authority over airlines and their consumer and competitive practices, and has used this authority to issue numerous regulations and pursue enforcement actions, including rules\u00a0and fines relating to the handling of lengthy tarmac delays, consumer notice requirements, consumer complaints, price and airline advertising, distribution, oversales and involuntary denied boarding process and compensation, ticket refunds, liability for loss, delay or damage to baggage, customer service commitments, contracts of carriage and the transportation of passengers with disabilities. Among these is the series of Enhanced Airline Passenger Protection rules\u00a0issued by the DOT. In addition, the adoption of FAR Part\u00a0117 in 2014 modified required pilot rest periods and work hours and Congress has enacted a law and the FAA issued regulations requiring U.S. airline pilots to have a minimum number of hours as a pilot in order to qualify for an Air Transport Pilot certificate which all pilots on U.S. airlines must obtain. Furthermore, in October\u00a02018, Congress passed the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, which extends FAA funds through fiscal\u00a0year 2023. The legislation contains provisions which could have effects on our results of operations and financial condition. Among other provisions, the new law requires the DOT to clarify that, with respect to a passenger who is involuntarily denied boarding as a result of an oversold flight, there is no maximum level of compensation an air carrier may pay to \n58\n\n\nTable of Contents\nsuch passenger and the compensation levels set forth in the regulations are the minimum levels of compensation an air carrier must pay to such a passenger, and to create new requirements for the treatment of disabled passengers. In addition it provides that the maximum civil penalty amount for damage to wheelchairs and other mobility aids or for injuring a disabled passenger may be trebled. The FAA must issue rules\u00a0establishing minimum dimensions for passenger seats, including seat pitch, width and length. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 also establishes new rest requirements for flight attendants and requires, within one\u00a0year, that the FAA issue an order requiring installation of a secondary cockpit barrier on each new aircraft. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 also provides for several other new requirements and rulemakings related to airlines, including but not limited to: (i)\u00a0prohibition on voice communication cell phone use during certain flights, (ii)\u00a0insecticide use disclosures, (iii)\u00a0new training policy best practices for training regarding racial, ethnic, and religious non-discrimination, (iv)\u00a0training on human trafficking for certain staff, (v)\u00a0departure gate stroller check-in, (vi)\u00a0the protection of pets on airplanes and service animal standards, (vii)\u00a0requirements to refund promptly to passengers any ancillary fees paid for services not received, (viii)\u00a0consumer complaint process improvements, (ix)\u00a0pregnant passenger assistance, (x)\u00a0restrictions on the ability to deny a revenue passenger permission to board or involuntarily remove such passenger from the aircraft, (xi)\u00a0minimum customer service standards for large ticket agents, (xii)\u00a0information publishing requirements for widespread disruptions and passenger rights, (xiii)\u00a0submission of plans pertaining to employee and contractor training consistent with the Airline Passengers with Disabilities Bill of Rights, (xiv)\u00a0ensuring assistance for passengers with disabilities, (xv)\u00a0flight attendant duty period limitations and rest requirements, including submission of a fatigue risk management plan, (xvi)\u00a0submission of policy concerning passenger sexual misconduct and (xvii)\u00a0development of Employee Assault Prevention and Response Plan related to the customer service agents. Furthermore, in September\u00a02019, the FAA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding flight attendant duty period limitations and rest requirements. The DOT also published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in January\u00a02020 regarding, for example, the accessibility features of lavatories and onboard wheelchair requirements on certain single-aisle aircraft with an FAA certificated maximum capacity of 125 seats or more, training flight attendants to proficiency on an annual basis to provide assistance in transporting qualified individuals with disabilities to and from the lavatory from the aircraft seat, and providing certain information on request to qualified individuals with a disability or persons inquiring on their behalf, on the carrier\u2019s website, and in printed or electronic form on the aircraft concerning the accessibility of aircraft lavatories. The DOT also recently published Final Rules\u00a0regarding traveling by air with service animals and defining unfair or deceptive practices. The DOT also recently published a Final Rule\u00a0clarifying that the maximum amount of denied boarding compensation that a carrier may provide to a passenger denied boarding involuntarily is not limited, prohibiting airlines from involuntarily denying boarding to a passenger after the passenger\u2019s boarding pass has been collected or scanned and the passenger has boarded (subject to safety and security exceptions), raising the liability limits for denied boarding compensation, and raising the liability limit for mishandled baggage in domestic air transportation. Failure to remain in full compliance with these rules\u00a0may subject us to fines or other enforcement action. FAR Part\u00a0117 and the minimum pilot hour requirements may also reduce our ability to meet flight crew staffing requirements.\nWe cannot assure you that compliance with these and other laws, regulations, orders, rulings and guidance will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCompliance with the laws, regulations, orders, rulings and guidance applicable to the airline industry may increase our costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, if our current standards do not meet the FAA\u2019s rules\u00a0regarding minimum dimensions for passenger seats, the number of seats on our aircraft would be reduced and our operating costs would increase.\nIn addition, the TSA imposes security procedures and requirements on U.S. airports and airlines serving U.S. airports, some of which are funded by a security fee imposed on passengers and collected by airlines, which impedes our ability to stimulate demand through low fares. We cannot forecast what additional security and safety requirements may be imposed in the future or the costs or revenue impact that would be associated with complying with such requirements.\n59\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFurthermore, the DoD continues to issue new IT systems security requirements which require expenditures in order to bring our systems into compliance. The DoD also recently issued a vaccination mandate that may impact our ability to hire and maintain staffing.\nOur ability to operate as an airline is dependent on our obtaining and maintaining authorizations issued to us by the DOT and the FAA. The FAA has the authority to issue mandatory orders relating to, among other things, operating aircraft, the grounding of aircraft, maintenance and inspection of aircraft, installation of new safety-related items, and removal and replacement of aircraft parts that have failed or may fail in the future. A decision by the FAA to ground, or require time-consuming inspections of or maintenance on, our aircraft, for any reason, could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Federal law requires that air carriers operating scheduled service be continuously \u201cfit, willing and able\u201d to provide the services for which they are licensed. Our \u201cfitness\u201d is monitored by the DOT, which considers managerial competence, operations, finances, and compliance record. In addition, under federal law, we must be a U.S. citizen (as determined under applicable law). Please see \u201cBusiness\u2014Foreign Ownership.\u201d While the DOT has seldom revoked a carrier\u2019s certification for lack of fitness, such an occurrence would render it impossible for us to continue operating as an airline. The DOT may also institute investigations or administrative proceedings against airlines for violations of regulations.\nInternational routes are regulated by air transport agreements and related agreements between the United States and foreign governments. Our ability to operate international routes is subject to change because the applicable agreements between the United States and foreign governments may be amended from time to time. Our access to new international markets may be limited by the applicable air transport agreements between the United States and foreign governments and our ability to obtain the necessary authority from the United States and foreign governments to fly the international routes. In addition, our operations in foreign countries are subject to regulation by foreign governments and our business may be affected by changes in law and future actions taken by such governments, including granting or withdrawal of government approvals and airport slots and restrictions on competitive practices. We are subject to numerous foreign regulations in the countries outside the United States where we currently provide service. If we are not able to comply with this complex regulatory regime, our business could be significantly harmed. Please see \u201cBusiness\u2014Government Regulation.\u201d\nOur business could be materially adversely affected if we lose the services of our key personnel.\nOur success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management team and key financial and operating personnel. In particular, we depend on the services of our senior management team, particularly Jude Bricker, our Chief Executive Officer, and Dave Davis, our President and Chief Financial Officer. The CARES Act places limitations on pay for these key positions. Competition for highly qualified personnel is intense, and the loss of any executive officer, senior manager, or other key employee without adequate replacement or the inability to attract new qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We do not maintain key-man life insurance on our management team.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members or executive officers.\nAs a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements and maintaining liability insurance for our directors and officers, which have increased in recent\u00a0years. We also have incurred and will incur costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, related rules\u00a0implemented or to be implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and Nasdaq\u2019s listing rules. The expenses incurred by public companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing. We expect these rules\u00a0and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly, although we are currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty. These laws and \n60\n\n\nTable of Contents\nregulations could also make it more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or our board committees or as our executive officers and may divert management\u2019s attention. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, our common stock could be delisted, and we could be subject to fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.\nOur quarterly results of operations fluctuate due to a number of factors, including seasonality.\nWe expect our quarterly results of operations to continue to fluctuate due to a number of factors, including our seasonal operations, competitive responses in key locations or routes, price changes in aircraft fuel and the timing and amount of maintenance expenses. As a result of these and other factors, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations and comparisons of our key operating statistics may not be reliable indicators of our future performance. Seasonality may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate since historically our passengers tend to fly more during the winter\u00a0months and less in the summer and fall\u00a0months. We cannot assure you that we will find profitable markets in which to operate during the off-peak season. Lower demand for air travel during the fall and other off-peak\u00a0months could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may not realize any or all of our estimated cost savings, which would have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nAs part of our business strategy, we expect to implement certain operational improvements and cost savings initiatives. Any cost savings that we realize from such efforts may differ materially from our estimates. Our estimates are the current estimates of the Company, but they involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such estimates. In addition, any cost savings that we realize may be offset, in whole or in part, by reductions in revenues, or through increases in other expenses. Any one-time costs incurred to achieve our cost savings going forward may be more than we expect and, to achieve additional cost savings, we may need to incur additional one-time costs. Our operational improvements and cost savings plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that may change at any time. We cannot assure you that our initiatives will be completed as anticipated or that the benefits we expect will be achieved on a timely basis or at all. The future performance of the Company may differ significantly from the anticipated performance of the Company.\nWe may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including commercial, employment, class action, whistleblower, patent, product liability and other litigation and claims, and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. In particular, in recent\u00a0years, there has been significant litigation in the United States and abroad involving airline consumer complaints. We have in the past faced, and may face in the future, claims by third parties that we have violated a passenger\u2019s rights. Such matters can be time-consuming, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, cause us to incur significant expenses or liability and/or require us to change our business practices. Because of the potential risks, expenses and uncertainties of litigation, we may, from time to time, settle disputes, even where we believe that we have meritorious claims or defenses. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n61\n\n\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nThe Credit Agreement contains restrictions that limit our flexibility.\nThe Credit Agreement contains, and any future indebtedness of ours could also contain, a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf\nincur additional debt, guarantee indebtedness, or issue certain preferred equity interests;\n\u25cf\npay dividends on or make distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, our capital stock, or make other restricted payments;\n\u25cf\nprepay, redeem, or repurchase certain debt;\n\u25cf\nmake loans or certain investments;\n\u25cf\nsell certain assets;\n\u25cf\ncreate liens on certain assets;\n\u25cf\nconsolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u25cf\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates;\n\u25cf\nalter the businesses we conduct;\n\u25cf\nenter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends; and\n\u25cf\ndesignate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nAs a result of these covenants, we will be limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. These restrictive covenants may limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. The failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of a substantial amount of our indebtedness.\nOur Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility is available solely to finance the acquisition of aircraft and engines and is not available for working capital or other general corporate purposes. As a result, only the $25,000 Revolving Credit Facility portion of the Credit Facilities may be available for general corporate purposes and as a general source of liquidity.\nWe are subject to certain restrictions on our business as a result of our participation in governmental programs under the CARES Act and we may be subject to similar or other restrictions pursuant to future governmental programs.\nUnder the Payroll Support Program, the Treasury provided us an aggregate of $62,312 in Payroll Support Payments from April\u00a021, 2020 to October\u00a01, 2020, and an additional $37,040 in grants during the first half of 2021 (collectively, the \u201cPayroll Support Payments\u201d). Further, we were notified on April\u00a015, 2021 that we would receive a grant of $34,547 under Payroll Support Program 3, which was received during April\u00a0and May\u00a02021. Additionally, on October\u00a026, 2020, we entered into the CARES Act Loan Agreement with the Treasury under the aviation direct loan program of the CARES Act. Pursuant to the CARES Act Loan Agreement, the Treasury agreed to extend loans to us in an aggregate principal amount of $45,000, subject to specified terms, which was due to be repaid on the earlier of (i)\u00a0October\u00a024, 2025 or (ii)\u00a0six\u00a0months prior to the expiration date of any \n62\n\n\nTable of Contents\nmaterial loyalty program securing the loan. See Notes\u00a03 and 8 to our audited consolidated financial statements included herein for more information.\nIn accordance with any grants and/or loans received under the CARES Act, we are required to comply with the relevant provisions of the CARES Act and the related implementing agreements which, among other things, include the following: the requirement to use the Payroll Support Payments exclusively for the continuation of payment of crewmember and employee wages, salaries and benefits; the requirement that certain levels of commercial air service be maintained until March\u00a01, 2022, if ordered by the DOT; the prohibitions on share repurchases of listed securities and the payment of common stock (or equivalent) dividends until September\u00a030, 2022; and restrictions on the payment of certain executive compensation until April\u00a01, 2023. We used a portion of the net proceeds from our initial public offering to repay in full all amounts outstanding under the CARES Act Loan on March\u00a024, 2021.\nThe substance and duration of restrictions to which we are subject under the grants and/or loans under the CARES Act, including, but not limited to, those outlined above, will materially affect our operations, and we may not be successful in managing these impacts. Further, these restrictions could limit our ability to take actions that we otherwise might have determined to be in the best interests of our company and our stockholders. In particular, limitations on executive compensation may impact our ability to retain senior management or other key employees during this critical time.\nWe cannot predict whether the assistance under any of these programs will be adequate to support our business for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic or whether additional assistance will be required or available in the future. Future governmental programs in which we participate may include similar or other restrictions on the operation of our business. There can be no assurances that additional grants will be available or that we will qualify for future programs.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock could vary significantly as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nThe following factors could affect our stock price:\n\u25cf\nour operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u25cf\nquarterly variations in the rate of growth (if any) of our financial or operational indicators, such as earnings per share, net income, revenues, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted EBITDAR and Adjusted CASM;\n\u25cf\nthe public reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u25cf\nstrategic actions by our competitors;\n\u25cf\nchanges in operating performance and the stock market valuations of other companies;\n\u25cf\nannouncements related to litigation;\n\u25cf\nour failure to meet revenue or earnings estimates made by research analysts or other investors;\n\u25cf\nchanges in revenue or earnings estimates, or changes in recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage, by equity research analysts;\n\u25cf\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n63\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u25cf\nsales of our common stock by us or our stockholders, or the perception that such sales may occur;\n\u25cf\nchanges in accounting principles, policies, guidance, interpretations, or standards;\n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of key management personnel;\n\u25cf\nactions by our stockholders;\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic and market conditions;\n\u25cf\nthe COVID-19 pandemic and its effects;\n\u25cf\ndomestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u25cf\nmaterial weakness in our internal control over financial reporting; and\n\u25cf\nthe realization of any risks described under this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, or other risks that may materialize in the future.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs, divert our management\u2019s attention and resources and harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and will be able to take advantage of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and, for as long as we continue to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d These exemptions include not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section\u00a0404(b)\u00a0of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of (i)\u00a0the last day of the first fiscal\u00a0year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07\u00a0billion, (ii)\u00a0the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule\u00a012b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur at the end of our most recently completed fiscal\u00a0year if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700\u00a0million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, we have been required to file annual and quarterly report under the Exchange Act for a period of at least 12\u00a0months and we have filed at least one annual report pursuant to the Exchange Act, (iii)\u00a0the last day of our fiscal\u00a0year ending December\u00a031, 2026, and (iv)\u00a0the date on which we have issued more than $1\u00a0billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may decline or become more volatile and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital if and when we need it.\nWe will incur significant costs and devote substantial management time as a result of operating as a public company, particularly after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nAs a public company, we have and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. For example, we are required to comply with the requirements of Section\u00a0404(a)\u00a0of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and \n64\n\n\nTable of Contents\nthe Dodd-Frank Act, as well as rules\u00a0and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and heightened auditing standards, and Nasdaq, our stock exchange, including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. The rules\u00a0governing management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. Compliance with these requirements will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly. In addition, our management and other personnel may need to divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time to these public company requirements. In particular, we expect to continue incurring significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In that regard, we may need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. Furthermore, if we fail to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment, we could suffer material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements and fail in meeting our reporting obligations, which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. Additionally, ineffective internal control over financial reporting could expose us to increased risk of fraud or misuse of corporate assets and subject us to potential delisting from Nasdaq, regulatory investigations, civil or criminal sanctions and litigation, any of which would have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nHowever, for as long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section\u00a0404(b)\u00a0of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nUnder the JOBS Act, \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies.\nAfter we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we expect to incur additional management time and cost to comply with the more stringent reporting requirements applicable to companies that are deemed accelerated filers or large accelerated filers, including complying with the auditor attestation requirements of Section\u00a0404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nWe cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur as a result of becoming a public company or the timing and materiality of such costs.\nWe are continuing to improve our internal control over financial reporting.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is not required to audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, which at the latest would be the end of the fiscal\u00a0year ending December\u00a031, 2026. At such time, our internal control over financial reporting may be insufficiently documented, designed or operating, which may cause our independent registered public accounting firm to issue a report that is adverse.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions limiting ownership and voting by non-U.S. citizens.\nTo comply with restrictions imposed by federal law on foreign ownership and control of U.S. airlines, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws restrict ownership and control of shares of our common stock by non-U.S. citizens. The restrictions imposed by federal law and DOT policy require that we be owned and controlled by U.S. citizens, that no more than 25% of our voting stock be owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by persons or entities who are not U.S. citizens, as defined in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a040102(a)(15), that no more than 49% of our stock be owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by persons or entities who are not U.S. citizens and \n65\n\n\nTable of Contents\nare from countries that have entered into \u201copen skies\u201d air transport agreements with the United States, that our president and at least two-thirds of the members of our Board of Directors and other managing officers be U.S. citizens and that we be under the actual control of U.S. citizens. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that the failure of non-U.S. citizens to register their shares on a separate stock record, which we refer to as the \u201cforeign stock record,\u201d would result in a loss of their voting rights in the event and to the extent that the aggregate foreign ownership of the outstanding common stock exceeds the foreign ownership restrictions imposed by federal law. Our bylaws further provide that no shares of our common stock will be registered on the foreign stock record if the amount so registered would exceed the foreign ownership restrictions imposed by federal law. If it is determined that the amount registered in the foreign stock record exceeds the foreign ownership restrictions imposed by federal law, shares will be removed from the foreign stock record, resulting in the loss of voting rights, in reverse chronological order based on the date of registration therein, until the number of shares registered therein does not exceed the foreign ownership restrictions imposed by federal law.\nThe restrictions on ownership and control of shares of our common stock could adversely impact the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nThe Apollo Stockholder has significant influence over us, and Apollo\u2019s interests may conflict with our interests and the interests of other stockholders.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, the Apollo Stockholder beneficially owned approximately 43% of the voting power of our outstanding common equity. Although the Apollo Stockholder beneficially owns less than 50% of our outstanding common equity, individuals affiliated with Apollo continue to have significant influence over the outcome of votes on all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors, entering into significant corporate transactions such as mergers, tender offers, and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and issuance of additional debt or equity. The interests of Apollo and its affiliates, including the Apollo Funds and the Apollo Stockholder, could conflict with or differ from our interests or the interests of our other stockholders. For example, the concentration of ownership held by the Apollo Stockholder could delay, defer, or prevent a change in control of our company or impede a merger, takeover, or other business combination which may otherwise be favorable for us. Additionally, Apollo and its affiliates are in the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to time, acquire and hold interests in or provide advice to businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us, or are suppliers or customers of ours. Apollo and its affiliates may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. Any such investment may increase the potential for the conflicts of interest discussed in this risk factor. So long as the Apollo Stockholder continues to directly or indirectly beneficially own a significant amount of our equity, even if such amount is less than 50%, the Apollo Stockholder will continue to be able to substantially influence or effectively control our ability to enter into corporate transactions. The Apollo Stockholder also has a right to nominate a number of directors comprising a\u00a0percentage of our board of directors in accordance with Apollo and its affiliates\u2019 beneficial ownership of the voting power of our outstanding common stock (rounded up to the nearest whole number).\nAlthough we are no longer a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of Nasdaq\u2019s rules, during a one-year transition period, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nAs of October\u00a019, 2021, the Apollo Stockholder no longer controlled a majority of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock and, as a result, we ceased to be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of Nasdaq\u2019s corporate governance standards. As a result, we are subject to additional corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that:\n\u25cf\na majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors;\n\u25cf\nthe nominating and corporate governance committee be composed entirely of independent directors;\n\u25cf\nthe compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors; and\n66\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u25cf\nthere be an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees.\nThe Nasdaq rules provide for phase-in periods for these requirements (including that each such committee consist of a majority of independent directors within 90 days of no longer being a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d), but we must be fully compliant with the requirements within one year of the date on which we cease to be a \u201ccontrolled company.\u201d We currently do not have a majority of independent directors on our board of directors, but two of the three members of each of our nominating and corporate governance committee and our compensation committee are independent. All three members of our audit committee are independent directors. During this transition period, our stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the Nasdaq corporate governance requirements and the ability of our independent directors to influence our business policies and affairs may be reduced. In addition, we may not be able to attract and retain the number of independent directors needed to comply with Nasdaq rules during the transition period.\nWe are a holding company and rely on dividends, distributions, and other payments, advances, and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations.\nWe are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own. As a result, we are largely dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers, including for payments in respect of our indebtedness, from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations. The agreements governing the indebtedness of our subsidiaries, including the CARES Act and the Credit Agreement, impose restrictions on our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us. Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity, and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from them and we may be limited in our ability to cause any future joint ventures to distribute their earnings to us. The deterioration of the earnings from, or other available assets of, our subsidiaries for any reason could also limit or impair their ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us.\nOur future earnings and earnings per share, as reported under GAAP, could be adversely impacted by the warrants granted to Amazon. If Amazon exercises its right to acquire shares of our common stock pursuant to the 2019 Warrants, this will dilute the ownership interests of our then-existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe warrants granted to Amazon in 2019 increase the number of diluted shares reported, which has an effect on our diluted earnings per share to the extent the warrants actually vest. The warrants have an exercise price of approximately $15.17 per share, approximately 17.3% of which had vested as of December\u00a031, 2021. A portion of the 2019 Warrants will vest incrementally based on aggregate global payments by Amazon to the Company or its affiliates pursuant to the ATSA. In addition, vesting can occur immediately in certain circumstances, including upon a change of control (as defined in the 2019 Warrant) or certain transfers of 30% or more of the voting power in the Company to a new person or group (other than any equity offering by the Company or the Apollo Stockholder pursuant to an effective registration statement so long as no person or group (within the meaning of the Exchange Act) acquires more than 50% of the voting power of the Company in such offering). If additional 2019 Warrants vest and Amazon exercises its right to acquire shares of our common stock pursuant to the 2019 Warrants, it will dilute the ownership interests of our then-existing stockholders and reduce our earnings per share. In addition, to the extent the common stock issued upon exercise of the 2019 Warrants is transferred to non-U.S. citizens, it will further limit the amount of our common stock that may be owned or controlled by other non-U.S. citizens. Furthermore, any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon the exercise of the 2019 Warrants could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\n67\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market, or the perception in the public market that such sales may occur, could reduce our stock price.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 57,872,452 shares of common stock outstanding, warrants to purchase 9,482,606 shares of common stock outstanding, options to purchase 5,290,714 shares of common stock outstanding and 4,679 shares of common stock that may be issued upon the vesting of outstanding restricted stock units. In addition, certain of our existing stockholders, including the Apollo Stockholder and Amazon, have certain rights to require us to register the sale of common stock held by them including in connection with underwritten offerings. Additionally, we filed a registration statement in respect of all shares of common stock that we may issue under the Omnibus Incentive Plan and the SCA Acquisition Equity Plan. After registration, these shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance. Sales of significant amounts of stock in the public market upon expiration of lock-up agreements, the perception that such sales may occur, or early release of any lock-up agreements, could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock or make it more difficult to sell shares of common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock. We intend to retain all future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business and the repayment of outstanding debt. The CARES Act and the Credit Agreement contain, and any future indebtedness likely will contain, restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and make other restricted payments. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock may be the major source of gain for the foreseeable future. While we may change this policy at some point in the future, we cannot assure that we will make such a change.\nWe are required to pay our pre-IPO stockholders for certain tax benefits, and the amounts of such payments could be material.\nWe entered into an income tax receivable agreement with our pre-IPO stockholders that provides for the payment by us to our pre-IPO stockholders of 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, foreign, state and local income tax that we and our subsidiaries actually realize for periods starting at least 12\u00a0months after the closing date of our initial public offering as a result of the utilization of tax attributes existing at the time of our initial public offering.\nThese tax attributes include net operating loss carryforwards, deductions, tax basis and certain other tax attributes, in each case that relate to periods (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the closing date of our initial public offering.\nWe expect that the payments we make under the income tax receivable agreement could be material. Assuming no material changes in the relevant tax law, and that we and our subsidiaries earn sufficient income to realize the full tax benefits subject to the income tax receivable agreement, we expect that future payments under the income tax receivable agreement will aggregate to be approximately $98,800 as of December\u00a031, 2021. Payments in accordance with the terms of the income tax receivable agreement could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nIn addition, under some circumstances, including certain mergers, asset sales and other transactions constituting a \u201cchange of control\u201d under the income tax receivable agreement or if we breach our obligations thereunder, the income tax receivable agreement will terminate and we will be required to make a payment equal to the present value of future payments under the income tax receivable agreement, which payment will be calculated based on certain assumptions, including those relating to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 future taxable income. In these situations, our obligations under the income tax receivable agreement could have a material and adverse impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales or other \u201cchange of control\u201d transactions.\n68\n\n\nTable of Contents\nTo the extent that we are unable to make payments under the income tax receivable agreement for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid, which could adversely affect our results of operations and could also affect our liquidity in periods in which such payments are made.\nFor more information on the income tax receivable agreement, see Note\u00a013 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.", "item7": ">ITEM\u00a07: MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nUnless otherwise indicated, the terms \"Sun Country,\" \"we,\" \"us\" and \"our\" refer to Sun Country Airlines Holdings,\u00a0Inc., and its subsidiaries.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from those estimates.\nOur most significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of those significant accounting policies require us to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, or estimates. An accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria:\n(i)\nthe estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and \n(ii)\ndifferent estimates reasonably could have been used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, changes in financial condition, or results of operations. \nWe have identified the following critical accounting policies:\n-\nRevenue Recognition\n-\nLoyalty Program Accounting\n74\n\n\nTable of Contents\n-\nAsset Impairment Analysis\n-\nValuation of the TRA Liability\n \nRevenue Recognition\n - Scheduled passenger service, charter service, and most ancillary revenues are recognized when the passenger flight occurs. Revenues exclude amounts collected on behalf of other parties, including transportation taxes.\nThe Company initially defers ticket sales as an air traffic liability and recognizes revenue when the passenger flight occurs. Unused non-refundable tickets expire at the date of scheduled travel and are recorded as revenue unless the customer notifies the Company in advance of such date that the customer will not travel.\u00a0If notification is made, a travel credit is created for the face value less applicable change fees.\u00a0Travel credits may generally be redeemed toward future travel for up to 12 months after the date of the original booking.\u00a0A portion of travel credits will expire unused.\u00a0The Company records an estimate for travel credits that will expire unused in passenger revenue. These estimates are based on historical experience of travel credit activity and consider other facts, such as recent program changes and modifications that could affect the ultimate usage patterns of tickets and travel credits. \nAncillary revenue for baggage fees, seat selection fees, and on-board sales is recognized when the associated flight occurs. Revenue for change fees is deferred and recognized when the passenger travel is provided. Fees received in advance of the flight date are initially recorded as an air traffic liability. \nCharter revenue is recognized at the time of departure when transportation is provided.\nCargo revenue is typically recognized based on hours flown, number of flights, and the amount of aircraft resources provided during a reporting period. Pursuant to ASC 606, \nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n, the ATSA contains three performance obligations: Flight Services, Heavy Maintenance and Fuel. As Sun Country is the principal in providing Flight Services, revenue and related costs are recognized gross on the Statement of Operations. Sun Country acts as the agent in providing the Heavy Maintenance and Fuel performance obligations, which are reimbursed by Amazon based on the actual costs incurred. Consumption of aircraft fuel and heavy maintenance are recognized in revenue, net of the associated costs incurred to fulfill the performance obligations. The transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling price. The transaction price for flight services, which includes an upfront payment for startup costs, is reduced by the estimated value of warrants to be issued to Amazon based on expected performance under the ATSA.\nLoyalty Program Accounting\n \u2013\n \nThe Company records a liability for loyalty points earned by passengers under its Sun Country Rewards program using two methods: (1) a liability for points that are earned by passengers on purchases of the Company\u2019s services is established by deferring revenue based on the redemption value net of breakage; and (2) a liability for points attributed to loyalty points issued to the Company\u2019s Visa card holders is established by deferring a portion of payments received from the Company\u2019s co-branded agreement. The Company\u2019s Sun Country Rewards program allows for the redemption of points to include payment towards air travel, land travel, taxes, and other ancillary purchases. The Company estimates breakage for loyalty points that are not likely to be redeemed. These estimates are based on historical experience of loyalty point redemption activity and other factors, such as program changes and modifications that could affect the ultimate usage pattern of loyalty points.\nAsset Impairment Analysis\n - Long-lived assets, such as Property & Equipment and finite-lived Intangible Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group be tested for impairment, the Company first compares the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined using various valuation techniques including discounted \n75\n\n\nTable of Contents\ncash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. No impairment losses were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019. \nValuation of the TRA Liability\n - The TRA liability is an estimate based on, among other things, (i) generation of future taxable income over the term of the TRA, (ii) the Company\u2019s participation in future government programs, (iii) stock option activity during periods prior to the commencement of payments under the TRA and (iv) future changes in tax laws. These factors could result in an increase or decrease in the related liability which would be recognized in the Company\u2019s earnings in the period of such change.\nThe following discussion and analysis presents factors that had a material effect on our results of operations during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Also discussed is our financial position as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. This section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risk, assumptions and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations, intentions and forecasts. Our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those set forth under the section of this report titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and elsewhere in this report. The \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and the \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d should be read carefully to gain an understanding of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements.\nBusiness Overview\nSun Country is a new breed of hybrid low-cost air carrier that dynamically deploys shared resources across our synergistic scheduled service, charter, and cargo businesses. By doing so, we believe we are able to generate high growth, high margins and strong cash flows with greater resilience than other passenger airlines. We focus on serving leisure and VFR passengers and charter customers as well as providing crew, maintenance and insurance services to Amazon, with flights throughout the United States and to destinations in Canada, Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. Based in Minnesota, we operate an agile network that includes our scheduled service business, our synergistic charter, and cargo businesses. We share resources, such as flight crews, across our scheduled service, charter, and cargo business lines with the objective of generating higher returns and margins and mitigating the seasonality of our route network. We optimize capacity allocation by market, time of\u00a0year, day of week, and line of business by shifting flying to markets during periods of peak demand and away from markets during periods of low demand with far greater frequency than nearly all other large U.S. passenger airlines. We believe our flexible business model generates higher returns and margins while also providing greater resiliency to economic and industry downturns than a traditional scheduled service carrier.\nOur scheduled service business combines low costs with a high quality product to generate higher Total Revenue per Available Seat Mile (\u201cTRASM\u201d) than Ultra Low-Cost Carriers (\u201cULCCs\u201d) while maintaining lower Adjusted Cost per Available Seat Mile (\u201cCASM\u201d) than Low Cost Carriers (\u201cLCCs\u201d), resulting in best-in-class unit profitability. Our business includes many cost characteristics of ULCCs (which includes Allegiant Travel Company, Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines), such as an unbundled product (which means we offer a base fare and allow customers to purchase ancillary products and services for an additional fee), point-to-point service and a single-family fleet of Boeing 737-NG aircraft, which allow us to maintain a cost base comparable to these ULCCs. However, we offer a high quality product that we believe is superior to ULCCs and consistent with that of LCCs (which includes Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways). For example, our product includes more legroom than ULCCs, complimentary beverages, in-flight entertainment, and in-seat power, none of which are offered by ULCCs.\nOur charter business, which is one of the largest narrow body charter operations in the United States, is a key component of our strategy both because it provides both inherent diversification and downside protection as well as because it is synergistic with our other businesses. Our charter business has several favorable characteristics, including: large repeat customers, more stable demand than scheduled service flying, and the \n76\n\n\nTable of Contents\nability to pass through certain costs, including fuel. Our diverse charter customer base includes casino operators, the U.S. Department of Defense, college, and professional sports teams. We are the leading charter airline for college sports including the National Collegiate Athletic Association (\u201cNCAA\u201d) Championships (notably \u201cMarch\u00a0Madness\u201d) as well as individual team travel. In fiscal\u00a0year 2021, we flew 153 college sports teams, which was lower than 2019 due to impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our charter business includes ad hoc, repeat, short-term and long-term service contracts with pass through fuel arrangements and annual rate escalations. Most of our business is non-cyclical because the U.S. Department of Defense and sports teams still fly during normal economic downturns and our casino contracts are long-term in nature.\nOn December\u00a013, 2019, we signed \nthe \nATSA with Amazon to provide air cargo services. Flying under the ATSA began in May\u00a02020 and we are currently flying 12 Boeing 737-800 cargo aircraft for Amazon. Our CMI service is asset-light from a Sun Country perspective as Amazon supplies the aircraft and covers many of the operating expenses, including fuel, and provides all cargo loading and unloading services. We are responsible for flying the aircraft under our air carrier certificate, crew, aircraft line maintenance and insurance, all of which allow us to leverage our existing operational expertise from our scheduled service and charter businesses. Our cargo business also enables us to leverage certain assets, capabilities, and fixed costs to enhance profitability and promote growth across our Company.\nOperations in Review\nWe believe a key component of our success is establishing Sun Country as a high growth, low-cost carrier in the United States by attracting customers with low fares and garnering repeat business by delivering a high-quality passenger experience, offering state-of-the-art interiors, free streaming of in-flight entertainment to passenger devices, seat reclining and seat-back power in all of our aircraft.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a dramatic decline in passenger demand across the U.S. airline industry. We have experienced a significant decline in demand related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused a material decline in our 2020 and 2021 revenues as compared to pre-pandemic levels, and has negatively impacted our financial condition and operating results.\nDuring 2021, we have continued to see recovery in demand from the COVID-19 pandemic relative to demand in 2020. However, the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on overall demand for air travel remains uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. In addition, the impact of COVID-19 vaccine mandates and uncertainties in pilot staffing, as well as higher fuel prices, could impact our business and results of operations in the near term.\nOn February 10, 2021, Sun Country, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary (the \u201cBorrower\u201d), entered into a new Credit Agreement which provides for a $25,000 Revolving Credit Facility and a $90,000 Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility. We received CARES Act grants totaling $71,587 and $62,312 during 2021 and 2020, respectively, and a CARES Act loan of $45,000 in October 2020.\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic induced industry downturn has delayed our growth in 2020 and 2021, we believe that our investments have positioned us to profitably grow our business in the long term following a rebound in the U.S. airline industry.\nOperating Revenues\nScheduled Service\n. Scheduled service revenue consists of base fares and expired passenger travel credits.\nCharter Service\n. Charter service revenue consists of revenue earned from our charter business, primarily generated through our service to the U.S. Department of Defense, collegiate and professional sports teams, and casinos.\n77\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAncillary\n. Ancillary revenue consists of revenue generated from air travel-related services such as baggage fees, seat selection and upgrade fees, itinerary service fees and on-board sales.\nCargo\n. Cargo revenue consists of air cargo transportation services under the ATSA with Amazon, primarily related to e-commerce delivery services.\nOther\n. Other revenue consists primarily of revenue from services in connection with our Sun Country Vacations products, including organizing ground services, such as hotel, car and transfers. Other revenue also includes services not directly related to providing passenger services such as the advertising, marketing and brand elements resulting from our co-branded credit card program. This component of our revenues also includes revenue from mail on regularly scheduled passenger aircraft.\nOperating Expenses\nAircraft Fuel\n. Aircraft fuel expense includes jet fuel, federal and state taxes, other fees and the mark-to-market gains and losses associated with our fuel derivative contracts since we do not apply hedge accounting. Aircraft fuel expense can be volatile, even between quarters, due to price changes and mark-to-market gains and losses in the value of the underlying derivative instruments as crude oil prices and refining margins increase or decrease.\nSalaries, Wages, and Benefits\n. Salaries, wages, and benefits expense includes salaries, hourly wages, bonuses, equity-based compensation, and profit sharing paid to employees for their services, as well as related expenses associated with medical benefits, employee benefit plans, employer payroll taxes and other employee related costs.\nAircraft Rent\n. Aircraft rent expense consists of\u00a0monthly lease charges for aircraft and spare engines under the terms of the related operating leases and is recognized on a straight-line basis. Aircraft rent expense also includes supplemental rent, which consists of maintenance reserves paid to aircraft lessors in advance of the performance of significant maintenance activities that are not probable of being reimbursed to us by the lessor during the lease term, as well as lease return costs, which consist of all costs that would be incurred at the return of the aircraft, including costs incurred to return the airframe and engines to the condition required by the lease. Aircraft rent expense is partially offset by the amortization of over-market liabilities related to unfavorable terms of our operating leases and maintenance reserves which existed as of the date of our acquisition by the Apollo Funds in 2018. See Note\u00a06 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the over-market liabilities.\nMaintenance\n. Maintenance expense includes the cost of all parts, materials and fees for repairs performed by us and our third-party vendors to maintain our fleet. It excludes direct labor cost related to our own mechanics, which are included in salaries, wages, and benefits expense. It also excludes maintenance expenses, which are deferred based on the built-in overhaul method for owned and finance leased aircraft, which is subsequently amortized as a component of depreciation and amortization expense. Our maintenance expense is reduced by the amortization of a liability (or contra-asset) established at the time of our acquisition by the Apollo Funds in 2018 related to maintenance events incurred by the new owners of Sun Country, but paid for by the previous owners. For more information on these maintenance expense credits, see Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSales and Marketing\n. Sales and marketing expense includes credit card processing fees, travel agent commissions and related global distribution systems fees, advertising, sponsorship and distribution costs, such as the costs of our call centers, and costs associated with our loyalty program. It excludes related salary and wages of personnel, which are included in salaries, wages, and benefits expense.\nDepreciation and Amortization\n. Depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets we own and leasehold improvements, amortization of finance leased assets, as well as the amortization of \n78\n\n\nTable of Contents\nfinite-lived intangible assets. It also includes the depreciation of significant maintenance expenses deferred under the built-in overhaul method for owned and certain finance leased aircraft.\nGround Handling. \nGround handling includes ground services at airports including baggage handling, ticket counter and other ground services.\nLanding Fees and Airport Rent. \nLanding fees and airport rent includes aircraft landing fees and charges for the use of airport facilities.\nSpecial Items, net. \nSpecial items, net reflects expenses, or credits to expense, that are not representative of our ongoing costs for the period presented and may vary from period to period in nature, frequency and amount.\nOther Operating. \nOther operating expenses include crew and other employee travel, interrupted trip expenses, information technology, property taxes and insurance, including hull-liability insurance, supplies, legal and other professional fees, facilities and all other administrative and operational overhead expenses.\nNon-operating Income (Expense)\nInterest Income\n. Interest income includes interest on our cash, cash equivalents and investment balances. Interest income is generally immaterial to our results of operations, reflecting the current low interest rate environment.\nInterest Expense\n. Interest expense includes interest and fees related to our outstanding debt and our finance leases, as well as the amortization of debt financing costs.\nOther, net\n. Other expenses include activities not classified in any other area of the Consolidated Statements of Operations, such as certain consulting expenses and changes in the TRA liability.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Deferred taxes are recorded based on differences between the financial statement basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities and available tax loss and credit carryforwards.\n79\n\n\nTable of

or are not utilized by management.\n(2) Total System operating statistics for Departures, Block hours, Aircraft miles, ASMs and Fuel gallons consumed include amounts related to flights operated for maintenance; therefore the Total System amounts are higher than the sum of Scheduled Service, Charter Service and Cargo amounts.\n(3) Scheduled service and charter service utilize the same fleet of aircraft. Aircraft counts and utilization metrics are shown on a system basis only.\n(4) Passenger-related statistics and metrics are shown only for scheduled service. Charter service revenue is driven by flight statistics.\n(5) CASM is a key airline cost metric. CASM is defined as operating expenses divided by total available seat miles.\n(6) Adjusted CASM is a non-GAAP measure derived from CASM by excluding fuel costs, costs related to our cargo operations, special items, and certain other costs.\n80\n\n\nTable of Contents\nKey Operating Statistics and

The increase is due to a significantly lower demand for passenger service in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and growth in cargo services compared to one\u00a0year ago.\nScheduled Service\n. \nScheduled service revenue increased by $86,330, or 45%, to $279,377 for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $193,047 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in scheduled service revenue was largely driven by an increase in demand for passenger service during 2021 as compared to 2020, which was reduced significantly due to government travel restrictions, quarantine requirements, and reduced passenger demand related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n82\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe table below presents select operating data for scheduled service, expressed as\u00a0year-over-year changes:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nYear Ended December\u00a031,\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n%\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2021\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2020\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nChange\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nChange\n\u200b\nDepartures\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 19,706\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 14,117\n\u200b\n 5,589\n\u200b\n 40\n%\nPassengers\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 2,733,364\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 1,679,242\n\u200b\n 1,054,122\n\u200b\n 63\n%\nAverage base fare per passenger\n\u200b\n$\n 102.21\n\u200b\n$\n 114.96\n\u200b\n (12.75)\n\u200b\n (11)\n%\nRPMs (thousands)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 3,618,208\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 2,250,974\n\u200b\n 1,367,234\n\u200b\n 61\n%\nASMs (thousands)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 4,844,203\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 3,466,240\n\u200b\n 1,377,963\n\u200b\n 40\n%\nTRASM (cents)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 8.35\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 7.69\n\u200b\n 0.66\n\u200b\n 9\n%\nPassenger load factor\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 74.7\n%\n\u200b\n 64.9\n%\n 9.8\npts\nna\n\u200b\n\u200b\nThe 63% increase in the number of scheduled service passengers in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily due to COVID-19 pandemic related demand reductions in the prior year period. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our average base fare was $102.21, compared to $114.96 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was the result of strong fares in the first quarter of 2020 until the start of the COVID-19 pandemic followed by a significant drop off that continued into 2021.\nCharter Service\n. \nCharter service revenue increased $29,201, or 30%, to $127,331 for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $98,130 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic drove a decrease in our 2020 charter service revenue. There was a 24% increase in block hours for 2021 as compared to 2020. Charter revenue per block hour was $8,508 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $8,101 for the year ended December 31, 2020, for an increase of 5%. This revenue per block hour increase is due to the ongoing recovery from the impacts of COVID-19. Rates in 2020 were under a lot of competitive pressure because other carriers had excess aircraft, crew, and resources to operate charter capacity, driving rates down. \u00a0For the year ended December 31, 2021, Charter TRASM was 13.39, compared to 11.97 for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAncillary\n. \nAncillary revenue increased by $49,182, or 72%, to $117,237 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2021, from $68,055 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020. The 63% increase in scheduled passengers during the period resulted in greater sales of air travel-related services such as baggage fees, seat selection and upgrade fees, and on-board sales. Ancillary revenue was $42.89 per passenger in the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2021, up from $40.53 per passenger in the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020. The increase in ancillary revenue per passenger in 2021 compared to 2020 was the result of increased demand for ancillary products, revenue optimization efforts, and a reduction in travel periods where change fees were waived\nCargo\n. \nRevenue from cargo services was $91,428 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2021, as compared to $36,809 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020. All of our cargo service revenue relates to the air cargo transportation services under the ATSA with Amazon that commenced in May\u00a02020. For the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2021, departures increased to 11,295, as compared to 4,642 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020, due to the timing of when the aircraft were brought into service in 2020.\nOther\n. \nOther revenue was $7,642 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2021, as compared to $5,445 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020. This was mainly the result of an increase in revenue from Sun Country Vacations due to improved bookings and an increase in co-branded marketing revenue related to our Sun Country VISA card.\nOperating Expenses\nAircraft Fuel\n. \nAircraft fuel expense was $129,110 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $83,392 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was mainly driven by a 39% increase in fuel gallons consumed resulting from a recovery in demand as demonstrated by a 37% increase in passenger service block hours, as well as a 38% increase in the average price per gallon of fuel. Additionally, the change \n83\n\n\nTable of Contents\nwas also driven by mark-to-market adjustments in Fuel Derivative contracts.

Salaries, wages, and benefits expense increased $36,566, or 26%, to $178,207 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $141,641 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The average headcount for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 1,884, as compared to 1,637 for the year ended December 31, 2020, for an increase of 247 or 15%. A significant portion of the headcount increase was due to a ramp up related to the insourcing of MSP ground handling, which was transitioned in-house from April 2020 to early 2021. Our Cargo segment was responsible for $42,486 of the consolidated salaries, wages, and benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $20,452 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $22,034 increase over the prior year is driven by additional headcount to support the operations and the timing of when the Amazon aircraft were brought into service in 2020. The Cargo segment began in May 2020, driving additional headcount required to support the ramp up of operations and aircraft under the ATSA.\nAircraft Rent\n. Aircraft rent expense decreased $13,336, or 43%, to $17,653 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2021, as compared to $30,989 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020. Aircraft rent expense decreased primarily due to the composition of our aircraft fleet shifting from aircraft under operating leases (for which the expense is recorded within aircraft rent) to owned aircraft (for which expense is recorded through depreciation and interest expense). Specifically, in the first six\u00a0months of 2021, we purchased six aircraft previously under operating leases. For the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, there was an average of seven and twelve aircraft under operating leases, respectively.\nMaintenance\n. Maintenance materials and repair expense increased $12,679, or 46%, to $40,095 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $27,416 for the year ended December 31, 2020. There were nine landing gear events in the year ended December 31, 2021 versus four during the year ended December 31, 2020, resulting in a cost increase of $1,497. There was also a $3,616 increase in costs, including wheels, brakes, consumables, and expendables, driven by increased departures. The cost of auxiliary power unit events increased $1,250, due to lower reimbursements in the year ended December 31, 2021. There was also a $1,000 increase due to unscheduled maintenance events. Our Cargo segment was responsible for $10,558 of the consolidated maintenance expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $4,959 for the prior year due to the timing of when the Amazon aircraft were brought into service in 2020. The Cargo segment expense primarily relates to line maintenance since heavy maintenance is reimbursed under the ATSA.\nSales and Marketing\n. Sales and marketing expense increased $5,490, or 33%, to $22,060 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2021, as compared to $16,570 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020. The passenger revenue increased 46% between these two periods, and was primarily responsible for a $2,778 increase in credit card processing fees and a $2,546 increase in global distribution system fees. The remaining increase primarily relates to higher advertising costs and travel agent commissions.\n84\n\n\nTable of Contents\nDepreciation and Amortization\n. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $6,933, or 14%, to $55,019 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $48,086 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the impact of a change in the composition of our aircraft fleet to an increased number of owned aircraft and aircraft under finance leases (for which the expense is recorded as amortization and interest expense). During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company also purchased three engines and a flight simulator. For the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, there was an average of nineteen and eleven owned aircraft, respectively. Additionally, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 there were an average of seven finance leases; however, there were numerous removals and additions that impacted amortization expense.\nGround Handling\n. Ground handling expense increased $6,385, or 31%, to $26,981 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2021, as compared to $20,596 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the 40% increase in scheduled departures during the same time periods.\nLanding Fees and Airport Rent\n. Landing fees and airport rent increased $9,470, or 30%, to $40,726 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2021, as compared to $31,256 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020. The increase of $9,470 was driven by the 40% increase in scheduled departures for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2021. Additionally, a decrease in rates in 2021 for $1,040 and an airline relief credit of $1,416 offset against the departure volume increase.\nSpecial Items, net\n. Special items, net was a benefit of $65,456 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $64,563 for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Special items, net included in refundable tax credits related to employee retention under the CARES Act. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Special items, net included $71,587 and $62,312 of funds granted under the CARES Act, respectively. These funds were to be used exclusively for the continuation of payments for salaries, wages, and benefits. The year ended December 31, 2021 included a charge of $6,963 related to net costs incurred to purchase six aircraft that were previously under operating leases. Our Cargo segment was allocated $18,400 of the amounts received under the CARES Act for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $10,721 for the year ended December 31, 2020, based on the respective segment salaries, wages, and benefits.\nOther Operating, net\n. Other operating, net expense increased $22,862, or 47%, to $71,580 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $48,718 for the year ended December 31, 2020, mainly due to increased departures. The Passenger segment increase of $14,447 was primarily driven by the higher level of operations which resulted in higher crew and other employee travel costs, catering expenses, and other operational overhead costs. Our Cargo segment was responsible for $15,152 and $6,838 of our consolidated other operating, net expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, driven by overhead expenses as well as crew and employee travel costs. There was also an additional cost of approximately $1,105 due to becoming a public company, primarily related to insurance, legal and consulting fees.\nNon-operating Income (Expense)\nInterest Expense\n. Interest expense increased $4,253, or 19%, to $26,326 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2021, as compared to $22,073 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020. The increase was primarily due to debt issued for the acquisition of new aircraft, including new debt incurred in connection with the 2019-1 EETC, and the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility.\nOther, net\n. Other, net for the year ended December 31, 2021 was a net income of $14,624 primarily due to a credit of $16,400 for the adjustment of our TRA liability. The decrease in the TRA liability was mainly due to the receipt of a CARES Act PSP3 grant of $34,547, which extended the time period in which distributions made to shareholders are restricted (from March 31, 2022 to September 30, 2022), an increase in actual 2021 pre-tax income, and a decrease in forecasted 2022 pre-tax income. Partially offsetting this income was $1,763 in expenses related to secondary stock offerings that occurred in May and October 2021. Other, net for the year ended December 31, 2020, was a net expense of $371, primarily due to a vendor settlement.\n85\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit). \nThe Company's effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 18.8% compared to 16.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The effective tax rate represents a blend of federal and state taxes and includes the impact of certain nondeductible or nontaxable items. The decrease in the current year rate compared to the statutory rate is primarily due to favorable permanent differences related to stock compensation deductions and non-deductible income related to the TRA. The decrease in the prior year rate compared to the statutory rate is primarily due a small amount of pre-tax loss in relation to the miscellaneous insignificant permanent adjustments.\nResults of Operations\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nYear Ended December\u00a031,\u00a0\n\u200b\n$\n\u200b\n%\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2020\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2019\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nChange\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nChange\n\u00a0\nOperating Revenues:\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\nScheduled Service\n\u200b\n$\n 193,047\n\u200b\n$\n 396,113\n\u200b\n$\n (203,066)\n\u200b\n (51)\n%\nCharter Service\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 98,130\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 174,562\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (76,432)\n\u200b\n (44)\n%\nAncillary\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 68,055\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 118,158\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (50,103)\n\u200b\n (42)\n%\nPassenger\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 359,232\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 688,833\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (329,601)\n\u200b\n (48)\n%\nCargo\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 36,809\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 36,809\n\u200b\n 100\n%\nOther\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 5,445\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 12,551\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (7,106)\n\u200b\n (57)\n%\nTotal Operating Revenues\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 401,486\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 701,384\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (299,898)\n\u200b\n (43)\n%\nOperating Expenses:\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\nAircraft Fuel\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 83,392\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 165,666\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (82,274)\n\u200b\n (50)\n%\nSalaries, Wages, and Benefits\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 141,641\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 140,739\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 902\n\u200b\n 1\n%\nAircraft Rent\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 30,989\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 49,908\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (18,919)\n\u200b\n (38)\n%\nMaintenance\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 27,416\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 35,286\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (7,870)\n\u200b\n (22)\n%\nSales and Marketing\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 16,570\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 35,388\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (18,818)\n\u200b\n (53)\n%\nDepreciation and Amortization\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 48,086\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 34,877\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 13,209\n\u200b\n 38\n%\nGround Handling\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 20,596\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 41,719\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (21,123)\n\u200b\n (51)\n%\nLanding Fees and Airport Rent\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 31,256\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 44,400\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (13,144)\n\u200b\n (30)\n%\nSpecial Items, net\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (64,563)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 7,092\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (71,655)\n\u200b\nNM\n\u200b\nOther Operating, net\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 48,718\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 68,187\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (19,469)\n\u200b\n (29)\n%\nTotal Operating Expenses\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 384,101\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 623,262\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (239,161)\n\u200b\n (38)\n%\nOperating Income\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 17,385\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 78,122\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (60,737)\n\u200b\n (78)\n%\nNon-operating Income (Expense): \n\u200b\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nInterest Income\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 377\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 937\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (560)\n\u200b\n (60)\n%\nInterest Expense\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (22,073)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (17,170)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (4,903)\n\u200b\n 29\n%\nOther, net\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (371)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (1,729)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 1,358\n\u200b\n (79)\n%\nTotal Non-operating Income (Expense), net\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (22,067)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (17,962)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (4,105)\n\u200b\n 23\n%\nIncome (Loss) before Income Tax\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (4,682)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 60,160\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (64,842)\n\u200b\n (108)\n%\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (778)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 14,088\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (14,866)\n\u200b\n (106)\n%\nNet Income (Loss)\n\u200b\n$\n (3,904)\n\u200b\n$\n 46,072\n\u200b\n$\n (49,976)\n\u200b\n (109)\n%\n(1)\n\u201cNM\u201d stands for not meaningful\nTotal Operating Revenues decreased $299,898, or 43%, to $401,485 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020 from $701,383 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019. The decrease is due to a significantly lower demand for passenger service in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, offset by growth in cargo services during fiscal\u00a0year 2020.\nScheduled Service\n. \nScheduled service revenue decreased by $203,067, or 51%, to $193,047 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020, from $396,113 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019. The decrease in scheduled service revenue was driven by a decline in passenger demand in 2020 related to government travel restrictions \n86\n\n\nTable of Contents\nand quarantine requirements related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, the number of scheduled service passengers was 1.7 million in the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020, down from 3.6 million in the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019. This drove a 42% decrease in departures and an 18\u00a0percentage point decrease in load factor. The decrease in load factor resulted in a decrease in TRASM of 16% to $7.69 from $9.17. Further, our scheduled service capacity, as measured by ASMs, decreased by 40%.\nThe table below presents select operating data for scheduled service:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nYear Ended December\u00a031,\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n%\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n2020\n\u200b\n2019\n\u200b\nChange\n\u200b\nChange\n\u00a0\nDepartures\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n 14,117\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n 24,311\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n (10,194)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n (42)\n%\u00a0\u00a0\nPassengers\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n 1,679,242\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n 3,565,939\n\u00a0\n (1,886,697)\n\u00a0\n (53)\n%\u00a0\u00a0\nAverage base fare per passenger\n\u200b\n$\n 114.96\n\u200b\n$\n 111.08\n\u00a0\n 3.88\n\u00a0\n 3\n%\u00a0\u00a0\nRPMs (thousands)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 2,250,974\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 4,473,347\n\u00a0\n (2,222,373)\n\u00a0\n (50)\n%\u00a0\u00a0\nASMs (thousands)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 3,466,240\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 5,747,391\n\u00a0\n (2,281,151)\n\u00a0\n (40)\n%\u00a0\u00a0\nTRASM (cents)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 7.69\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 9.17\n\u00a0\n (1.48)\n\u00a0\n (16)\n%\u00a0\u00a0\nPassenger load factor\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 64.9\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 82.5\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n (17.6)\npts\nna\n\u200b\n\u200b\nThe 53% decrease in the number of scheduled service passengers in the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily due to COVID-19 pandemic related lower demand in 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our average base fare was $114.96, compared to $111.08 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The net change is the result of a strong start to 2020 with higher average fares followed by a significant drop in passengers due to COVID-19. \u00a0This significant drop in passengers resulted in only a minimal impact on the year ended December 31, 2020 average base fare.\nCharter Service\n. \nCharter service revenue decreased by $76,431, or 44%, to $98,130 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020 from $174,562 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic drove a decrease in our charter service revenue due to a decrease in the number of charter flights for our casino and sports customers and the U.S. Department of Defense, resulting in a 38% decrease in charter departures. Our charter service revenue began to rebound in the second half of 2020 as charter customers such as the U.S. Department of Defense and large university sports teams continued to fly throughout the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020, while our casino customers subject to long term contracts began flying again in June\u00a02020. In addition, we entered into a contract with Major League Soccer to provide charter flights for professional soccer teams which commenced in August\u00a02020.\nAncillary\n. \nAncillary revenue decreased by $50,103, or 42%, to $68,055 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020 from $118,158 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019. The decline in passenger demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in lower demand for air travel-related services such as baggage fees, seat selection and upgrade fees, and on-board sales. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in ancillary revenue on a per passenger basis which is largely related to increased itinerary service fees. Specifically, ancillary revenue was $40.53 per passenger in the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020, up from $33.14 per passenger in the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019. The increase in ancillary revenue per passenger in 2020 relative to 2019 was a result of increased demand for ancillary products and revenue optimization efforts.\nCargo\n. \nRevenue from cargo services was $36,809 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020, with no comparative revenue for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019. All of our 2020 cargo service revenue related to the commencement of air cargo transportation services under the ATSA with Amazon in May\u00a02020. In June\u00a02020, we entered into an amendment to the ATSA with Amazon that added two additional aircraft to the agreement, which were delivered in the fourth quarter of 2020, bringing the total number of aircraft we fly for Amazon to 12.\nOther\n. \nOther revenue decreased by $7,106, or 57%, to $5,445 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020 from $12,551 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019. The decrease in our other revenue was driven by lower bookings for our Sun Country Vacations products due to a decline in demand for leisure travel related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n87\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOperating Expenses\nAircraft Fuel\n. Aircraft fuel expense decreased by $82,274, or 50%, to $83,392 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020, as compared to $165,666 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by a 44% decrease in fuel gallons consumed due to our decreased level of operations as a result of reduced demand relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further contributing to the decrease in\u00a0aircraft fuel expense was a 30% decline in average price per gallon of fuel which was driven by lower\u00a0worldwide demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These decreases were partially offset by mark-to-market losses of $14,259 in the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020 compared to mark-to-market gains of $10,126 in the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019 from our fuel derivative contracts associated with our economic fuel hedges.\nThe primary components of Fuel Expense are shown in the following table:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nYear Ended December\u00a031,\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n%\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n2020\n\u200b\n2019\n\u200b\nChange\n\u200b\nChange\n\u00a0\nTotal Aircraft Fuel Expenses\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n$\n 83,392\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n$\n 165,666\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n$\n (82,274)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n (50)\n%\nExclude: Fuel Derivative Gains (Losses)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (14,259)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 10,126\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (24,385)\n\u00a0\nNM\n\u200b\nOther Excluded Items\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 313\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 444\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (131)\n\u00a0\n (30)\n%\u00a0\u00a0\nAircraft Fuel Expenses, excluding derivatives\n\u200b\n$\n 69,446\n\u200b\n$\n 176,236\n\u200b\n$\n (106,790)\n\u00a0\n (61)\n%\nFuel Gallons Consumed (thousands)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 43,844\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 78,042\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (34,198)\n\u200b\n (44)\n%\u00a0\u00a0\nFuel Cost per Gallon, excluding derivatives\n\u200b\n$\n 1.58\n\u200b\n$\n 2.26\n\u200b\n$\n (0.68)\n\u00a0\n (30)\n%\n(1)\n\"NM\" stands for not meaningful\nSalaries, Wages and Benefits.\u2003\nSalaries, wages and benefits expense increased by $902, or 1%, to $141,641 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020, as compared to $140,739 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019. The increase was primarily due to increased headcount, primarily related to insourcing certain ground handling operations, and to increased pilot pay and per diems to support operations under the ATSA. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in expenses related to employee benefits, reduction in flight attendant headcount, and call center staffing due to lower volume of calls. Additionally, the grants under the Payroll Support Program received in the second and third quarters of 2020 restricted us from taking measures to reduce headcount through September\u00a030, 2020 in response to the decline in operations. Our cargo segment was responsible for $20,452 of the consolidated salaries, wages, and benefits expense for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020 and was driven by headcount to support the operations and aircraft under the ATSA.\nAircraft Rent\n. Aircraft rent expense decreased by $18,919, or 38%, to $30,989 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $49,908 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Aircraft rent expense decreased primarily due to the composition of our aircraft fleet shifting from aircraft under operating leases (for which the expense is recorded within aircraft rent) to owned aircraft and aircraft under finance leases (for which the expense is recorded within depreciation and amortization). Specifically, in the year ended December 31, 2020 we purchased two aircraft previously under operating lease and leased two fewer seasonal aircraft. Additionally, a 42% decrease in passenger block hours resulted in a decrease in supplemental rent. The decrease in aircraft rent expense was partially offset by a reduction in the amortization of over-market liabilities on six aircraft recorded as a result of acquisition accounting for the acquisition by the Apollo Funds, of which three were returned at the end of their lease terms during 2019, and three were financed using the 2019-01 EETC following their lease maturity during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nMaintenance\n. Maintenance materials and repair expense decreased by $7,870, or 22%, to $27,416 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020, as compared to $35,286 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019. The decrease was driven primarily by the COVID-19 pandemic which caused reduced aircraft utilization, as measured by a 28% decrease in total block hours and a 27% decrease in flight cycles. These factors ultimately resulted in fewer maintenance events and lower major and routine maintenance costs. The decrease in maintenance expense was partially offset by an increase in scheduled heavy maintenance for our passenger aircraft fleet and line maintenance on the additional aircraft under the ATSA related to our cargo operations. Our cargo \n88\n\n\nTable of Contents\nsegment was responsible for $4,959 of the consolidated maintenance expense for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020, driven by expenses for line maintenance on aircraft operated under the ATSA.\nSales and Marketing\n. Sales and marketing expense decreased by $18,818, or 53%, to $16,570 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020, as compared to $35,388 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a $7,052 reduction in credit card processing fees related to lower sales on our scheduled service. Additionally, there was a $2,016 decrease in advertising costs, a $6,142 decrease in global distribution systems fees associated with the decrease in scheduled service and a $1,268 decrease in travel agent commissions, all due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDepreciation and Amortization\n. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $13,209, or 38%, to $48,086 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020, as compared to $34,877 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019. The increase was primarily due to the impact of a change in the composition of our aircraft fleet to an increased number of owned aircraft in connection with our 2019-1 EETC and aircraft under finance leases (for which expense is recorded within depreciation and amortization). Specifically, the increase is due to the incremental depreciation related to one aircraft previously under an operating lease which was amended and converted into a finance lease in December\u00a02019, one incremental aircraft obtained through a new finance lease, one aircraft we purchased in December\u00a02019, two aircraft we purchased in the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020 which were previously under operating leases and two aircraft we purchased in the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020 which were new additions to the fleet.\nGround Handling\n. Ground handling expense decreased by $21,123, or 51%, to $20,596 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020, as compared to $41,719 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the 27% decline in departures. Additionally, we began insourcing our MSP operations in April\u00a02020, contributing to a reduction of $4,434 in ground handling expenses, but resulting in higher salaries, wages and benefits.\nLanding Fees and Airport Rent\n. Landing fees and airport rent decreased by $13,144, or 30%, to $31,256 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020, as compared to $44,400 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019. The decrease was driven by the 27% reduction in departures during the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020. Our cargo segment was responsible for $281 of the consolidated landing fees and airport rent for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020, driven by allocated airport rent.\nSpecial Items, net\n. Special items, net was an income of $64,563 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031,\u00a02020 and an expense of $7,092 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019. For the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020, Special items, net included a $62,312 credit related to funds received under the CARES Act Payroll Support Program, to be used exclusively for the continuation of payments for salaries, wages, and benefits, and $2,328 in refundable tax credits related to employee retention under the CARES Act. For the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019, Special items, net included a charge of $7,578 related to contractual obligations for retired technology. In connection with implementing our new reservations systems, we incurred obligations under the contracts for our existing systems that were being phased out ahead of their scheduled contract terms, creating an expense that is not reflective of the normal operations of the company. We also incurred expense of $714 in connection with the write-off of assets in connection with the relocation of our headquarters in 2019. Special items, net for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019 was partially offset by $1,200 of proceeds from the sale of unused airport slot rights. We are not in the business of buying and selling operating rights and we do not hold any other remaining airport slot rights; therefore this gain does not reflect our core business operations. Our cargo segment was responsible for $10,721 of the consolidated income from consolidated special items, net for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020, driven by allocated amounts from the CARES Act, based on the respective segment salaries, wages and benefits.\nOther Operating, net\n. Other operating, net expense decreased by $19,469, or 29%, to $48,718 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020, as compared to $68,187 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by our lower level of operations related to the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in reduced crew and other employee travel costs, interrupted trip expenses, catering expenses, and other \n89\n\n\nTable of Contents\noperational overhead costs. Our cargo segment was responsible for $6,838 of our consolidated other operating, net expense for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020.\nNon-operating Income (Expense)\nInterest Income\n. \nInterest income decreased $560 in the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020 related to lower average cash balances.\nInterest Expense\n. Interest expense increased by $4,903, or 29%, to $22,073 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020, as compared to $17,170 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019. The increase was primarily due to debt issued for the acquisition of new aircraft and spare engines, including new debt incurred in connection with the 2019-1 EETC.\nOther, net\n. Other, net expense decreased $1,358, or 79%, to $371 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020, as compared to $1,729 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019. The decrease is mainly due to early-out payments and other expenses incurred in connection with outsourcing certain ground operations during the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019, which did not occur in the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031,\u00a02020.\nIncome Tax Expense.\u2003\nOur effective tax rate was 16.6% for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020, as compared to 23.5% for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2019. Our tax rate can vary depending on the amount of income we earn in each state and the state tax rate applicable to such income.\n\u200b\nSegment Information\n\u200b\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nYear Ended \n\u200b\nYear Ended \n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\nDecember 31, 2021\n\u200b\nDecember 31, 2020 \n(1)\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPassenger\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nCargo\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nTotal\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPassenger\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nCargo\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nTotal\n\u00a0\nOperating Revenues\n\u200b\n$\n 531,587\n\u200b\n$\n 91,428\n\u200b\n$\n 623,015\n\u200b\n$\n 364,677\n\u200b\n$\n 36,809\n\u200b\n$\n 401,486\n\u200b\nOperating Expenses:\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\nAircraft Fuel\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 128,863\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 247\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 129,110\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 83,392\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 83,392\n\u200b\nSalaries, Wages, and Benefits\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 135,721\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 42,486\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 178,207\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 121,189\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 20,452\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 141,641\n\u200b\nAircraft Rent\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 17,653\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 17,653\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 30,989\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 30,989\n\u200b\nMaintenance\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 29,537\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 10,558\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 40,095\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 22,457\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 4,959\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 27,416\n\u200b\nSales and Marketing\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 22,060\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 22,060\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 16,570\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 16,570\n\u200b\nDepreciation and Amortization\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 54,914\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 105\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 55,019\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 48,086\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 48,086\n\u200b\nGround Handling\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 26,981\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 26,981\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 20,596\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 20,596\n\u200b\nLanding Fees and Airport Rent\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 40,230\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 496\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 40,726\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 30,975\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 281\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 31,256\n\u200b\nSpecial Items, net\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (47,056)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (18,400)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (65,456)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (53,842)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (10,721)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (64,563)\n\u200b\nOther Operating, net\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 56,428\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 15,152\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 71,580\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 41,880\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 6,838\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 48,718\n\u200b\nTotal Operating Expenses\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 465,331\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 50,644\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 515,975\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 362,292\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 21,809\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 384,101\n\u200b\nOperating Income\n\u200b\n$\n 66,256\n\u200b\n$\n 40,784\n\u200b\n$\n 107,040\n\u200b\n$\n 2,385\n\u200b\n$\n 15,000\n\u200b\n$\n 17,385\n\u200b\nAdjustment for Special Items\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (47,056)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (18,400)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (65,456)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (53,842)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (10,721)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (64,563)\n\u200b\nOperating Income (Loss), Excluding Special Items\n\u200b\n$\n 19,200\n\u200b\n$\n 22,384\n\u200b\n$\n 41,584\n\u200b\n$\n (51,457)\n\u200b\n$\n 4,279\n\u200b\n$\n (47,178)\n\u200b\nOperating Margin %, Excluding Special Items\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 4\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 24\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 7\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n (14)\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 12\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n (12)\n%\n(1)\nAir cargo operations with Amazon commenced in May\u00a02020.\nPassenger. \nPassenger operating income increased by $63,871 to $66,256 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2021 from $2,385 for the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020.

We believe these non-GAAP measures provide a meaningful comparison of our results to others in the airline industry and our prior\u00a0year results. Investors should consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, our financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further, our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies. We believe certain charges included in our operating expenses on a GAAP basis make it difficult to compare our current period results to prior periods as well as future periods and guidance. The tables below show a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this report to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n91\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAdjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin and Adjusted Net Income\nAdjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin and Adjusted Net Income are non-GAAP measures included as supplemental disclosure because we believe they are useful indicators of our operating performance. Derivations of operating income and net income are well recognized performance measurements in the airline industry that are frequently used by our management, as well as by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in comparing the operating performance of companies in our industry.\nAdjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin and Adjusted Net Income have limitations as analytical tools. Some of the limitations applicable to these measures include: Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin and Adjusted Net Income do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin and Adjusted Net Income differently than we do, limiting each measure\u2019s usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin and Adjusted Net Income should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nAs derivations of operating income and net income, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin, and Adjusted Net Income are not determined in accordance with GAAP, such measures are susceptible to varying calculations and not all companies calculate these measures in the same manner. As a result, derivations of operating income and net income, including Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin and Adjusted Net Income, as presented may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. For the foregoing reasons, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin and Adjusted Net Income have significant limitations which affect their use as indicators of our profitability and valuation. Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information.\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of Operating Income (Loss) to Adjusted Operating Income (Loss), and Adjusted Operating Income Margin (Loss) for the periods presented below.\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nYear Ended December\u00a031,\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2021\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2020\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2019\n\u00a0\nAdjusted Operating Income Margin (Loss) reconciliation:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\nOperating Revenue\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n$\n 623,015\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n$\n 401,486\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n$\n 701,384\n\u200b\nOperating Income\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 107,040\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 17,385\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 78,122\n\u200b\nSpecial Items, net \n(a)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (65,456)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (64,563)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 7,092\n\u200b\nStock compensation expense\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 5,562\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 2,110\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 1,888\n\u200b\nVoluntary leave expense \n(b)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 4,881\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\n\u200b\nTRA expenses \n(c)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 320\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\n\u200b\nOther Adjustments \n(d)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 3,015\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 226\n\u200b\nAdjusted Operating Income (Loss)\n\u200b\n$\n 50,481\n\u200b\n$\n (40,187)\n\u200b\n$\n 87,328\n\u200b\nOperating Income Margin\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 17.2\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 4.3\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 11.1\n%\nAdjusted Operating Income Margin (Loss)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 8.1\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n (10.0)\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 12.5\n%\n(a)\nThe adjustments include Special Items, net, as presented in Note\u00a015 of the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(b)\nThis represents expenses related to a voluntary employee leave program in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a portion of which is offset by the CARES Act Payroll Support Program as the benefit of this program is also adjusted as a component of Special Items, net.\n(c)\nThis represents the one-time costs to establish the TRA with our pre-IPO stockholders, plus the quarterly cost to revalue the liability balance.

We believe that while items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAR may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance, Adjusted EBITDAR is useful because its calculation isolates the effects of financing in general, the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions (primarily aircraft, which may be acquired directly, directly subject to acquisition debt, by finance \n93\n\n\nTable of Contents\nlease or by operating lease, each of which is presented differently for accounting purposes), and income taxes, which may vary significantly between periods and for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. Adjusted EBITDAR should not be viewed as a measure of overall performance or considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income because it excludes aircraft rent, which is a normal, recurring cash operating expense that is necessary to operate our business. We have historically incurred substantial rent expense due to our legacy fleet of operating leased aircraft, which are currently being transitioned to owned aircraft.\nAdjusted EBITDAR has limitations as an analytical tool. Some of the limitations applicable to this measure include: Adjusted EBITDAR does not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; Adjusted EBITDAR does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; Adjusted EBITDAR does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; it does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt; although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDAR does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDAR differently than we do, limiting each measure\u2019s usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDAR should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDAR for the periods presented below.\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nYear Ended December\u00a031,\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2021\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2020\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2019\nAdjusted EBITDAR Reconciliation:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nNet Income (Loss)\n\u200b\n$\n 77,470\n\u200b\n$\n (3,904)\n\u200b\n$\n 46,072\nSpecial Items, net \n(a)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (65,456)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (64,563)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 7,092\nStock Compensation expense\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 5,562\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 2,110\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 1,888\nVoluntary leave expense \n(b)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 4,881\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\nLoss on asset transactions, net\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 3\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 413\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 745\nSecondary Offering Costs\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 1,763\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\nTRA expenses \n(c)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 320\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\nTRA adjustment \n(d)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (16,400)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\nInterest Income\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (85)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (377)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (937)\nInterest expense\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 26,326\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 22,073\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 17,170\nProvision for income taxes\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 17,953\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (778)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 14,088\nDepreciation and Amortization\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 55,019\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 48,086\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 34,877\nAircraft rent\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 17,653\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 30,989\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 49,908\nOther Adjustments \n(e)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 3,015\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 226\nAdjusted EBITDAR\n\u200b\n$\n 123,143\n\u200b\n$\n 38,930\n\u200b\n$\n 171,129\n(a)\nThe adjustments include Special Items, net, as presented in Note\u00a015 of the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(b)\nThis represents expenses related to a voluntary employee leave program in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a portion of which is offset by the CARES Act Payroll Support Program as the benefit of this program is also adjusted as a component of Special Items, net.\n(c)\nThis represents the one-time costs to establish the TRA with our pre-IPO stockholders, plus the quarterly cost to revalue the liability balance.

Adjusted CASM is a non-GAAP measure derived from CASM by excluding fuel costs, costs related to our cargo operations (starting in 2020 when we launched our cargo operations), certain commissions and other costs of selling our vacation products from this measure as these costs are unrelated to our airline operations and improve comparability to our peers. Adjusted CASM is an important measure used by management and by our Board of Directors in assessing quarterly and annual cost performance. Adjusted CASM is commonly used by industry analysts and we believe it is an important metric by which they compare our airline to others in the industry, although other airlines may exclude certain other costs in their calculation of Adjusted CASM. The measure is also the subject of frequent questions from investors.\nAdjusted CASM excludes fuel costs. By excluding volatile fuel expenses that are outside of our control from our unit metrics, we believe that we have better visibility into the results of operations and our non-fuel cost initiatives. Our industry is highly competitive and is characterized by high fixed costs, so even a small reduction in non-fuel operating costs can lead to a significant improvement in operating results. In addition, we believe that all domestic carriers are similarly impacted by changes in jet fuel costs over the long run, so it is important for management and investors to understand the impact and trends in company-specific cost drivers, such as labor rates, aircraft costs and maintenance costs, and productivity, which are more controllable by management.\nStarting in 2020 when we launched our cargo operations, we have excluded costs related to the cargo operations as these operations do not create ASMs.\u00a0The cargo expenses in the reconciliation below are different from the total operating expenses for our Cargo segment in the \u201cSegment Information\u201d table presented above, due to several items that are included in the Cargo segment but have been captured in other line items used in the Adjusted CASM calculation. We also exclude certain commissions and other costs of selling our vacation products from Adjusted CASM as these costs are unrelated to our airline operations and improve comparability to our peers. Adjusted CASM further excludes special items and other adjustments, as defined in the relevant reporting period, that are not representative of the ongoing costs necessary to our airline operations and may improve comparability between periods. We also exclude stock compensation expense when computing Adjusted CASM. The Company\u2019s compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based compensation to attract and retain employees and executives and is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long-term employee retention, rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any period. Thus, stock-based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any period.\nAs derivations of Adjusted CASM are not determined in accordance with GAAP, such measures are susceptible to varying calculations and not all companies calculate the measures in the same manner. As a result, derivations of Adjusted CASM as presented may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Adjusted CASM should not be considered in isolation or as a replacement for CASM. For the foregoing reasons, Adjusted CASM has significant limitations which affect its use as an indicator of our profitability. Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information.\n95\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables present the reconciliation of CASM to Adjusted CASM.\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nYear Ended December\u00a031,\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n2021\n\u200b\n2020\n\u200b\n2019\n\u200b\n\u200b\nOperating\n\u200b\nPer\u00a0ASM\n\u200b\nOperating\n\u200b\nPer\u00a0ASM\u00a0\n\u200b\nOperating\u00a0\n\u200b\nPer\u00a0ASM\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0Expenses\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0(in\u00a0cents)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0Expenses\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n(in\u00a0cents)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nExpenses\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0(in\u00a0cents)\nCASM\n\u200b\n$\n 515,975\n\u200b\n 8.86\n\u200b\n$\n 384,101\n\u200b\n 8.91\n\u200b\n$\n 623,262\n\u200b\n 8.82\nLess:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nAircraft fuel\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 129,110\n\u00a0\n 2.22\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 83,392\n\u00a0\n 1.93\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 165,666\n\u00a0\n 2.35\nStock Compensation expense\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 5,562\n\u00a0\n 0.10\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 2,110\n\u00a0\n 0.05\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 1,888\n\u00a0\n 0.03\nSpecial items, net \n(a)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (65,456)\n\u00a0\n (1.12)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (64,563)\n\u00a0\n (1.50)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 7,092\n\u00a0\n 0.10\nVoluntary leave expense \n(b)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \u2014\n\u00a0\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 4,881\n\u00a0\n 0.12\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \u2014\n\u00a0\n \u2014\nTRA Expense \n(c)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 320\n\u00a0\n 0.01\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \u2014\n\u00a0\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \u2014\n\u00a0\n \u2014\nCargo expenses, not already adjusted above\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 67,203\n\u00a0\n 1.15\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 31,429\n\u00a0\n 0.73\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \u2014\n\u00a0\n \u2014\nSun Country Vacations\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 781\n\u00a0\n 0.01\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 589\n\u00a0\n 0.01\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 2,448\n\u00a0\n 0.03\nOther Adjustments \n(d)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 3,015\n\u00a0\n 0.05\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \u2014\n\u00a0\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 226\n\u00a0\n \u2014\nAdjusted CASM\n\u200b\n$\n 375,440\n\u00a0\n 6.44\n\u200b\n$\n 326,263\n\u00a0\n 7.57\n\u200b\n$\n 445,942\n\u00a0\n 6.31\nAvailable Seat Miles\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 5,826,827\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 4,311,142\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 7,064,563\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n(a)\nThe adjustments include Special Items, net, as presented in Note\u00a015 of the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(b)\nThis represents expenses related to a voluntary employee leave program in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a portion of which is offset by the CARES Act Payroll Support Program as the benefit of this program is also adjusted as a component of Special Items, net.\n(c)\nThis represents the one-time costs to establish the TRA with our pre-IPO stockholders, plus the quarterly cost to revalue the liability balance.

We have historically funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily through cash from operations, proceeds from stockholders\u2019 capital contributions, the issuance of promissory notes, our 2019-1 EETC financing, and the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility. In March\u00a02021, the Company offered 9,090,909 shares of common stock to the public at $24.00 per share. The underwriters had an option to purchase an additional 1,363,636 shares from the Company at the public offering price, which they exercised. In total, all 10,454,545 shares were issued and the net proceeds to the Company were $225,329 after deducting underwriting discounts\u00a0and commissions,\u00a0and other offering\u00a0expenses.\nOur primary sources of liquidity as of December\u00a031, 2021 included our existing cash and cash equivalents of $309,338 and short-term investments of $6,283, our expected cash generated from operations and our $25,000 Revolving Credit Facility, which was undrawn as of December\u00a031, 2021. In addition, we had restricted cash of $8,447 as of December\u00a031, 2021, which consists of cash received as prepayment for chartered flights that is maintained in separate escrow accounts in accordance with DOT regulations requiring that charter revenue receipts received prior to the date of transportation are maintained in a separate third-party escrow account. The restrictions are released once transportation is provided.\n96\n\n\nTable of Contents\nDuring 2021, we received grants totaling $71,587 from the Treasury under PSP2 and PSP3. We received a total of $62,312 in assistance from the Treasury in 2020 as part of the Payroll Support Program under the CARES Act. We also received a CARES Act Loan of $45,000 in October 2020. In accordance with any grants and/or loans received under the CARES Act, we are required to comply with the relevant provisions of the CARES Act and the related implementing agreements which, among other things, include the following: the requirement to use the Payroll Support Payments exclusively for the continuation of payment of crewmember and employee wages, salaries and benefits; the requirement that certain levels of commercial air service be maintained until March 1, 2022, if ordered by the DOT; the prohibitions on share repurchases of listed securities and the payment of common stock (or equivalent) dividends until September 30, 2022 under PSP3; and restrictions on the payment of certain executive compensation until April 1, 2023 under PSP3. A portion of the proceeds from our initial public offering was used to repay in full all amounts outstanding under the CARES Act Loan.\nOn February 10, 2021, Sun Country, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary (the \u201cBorrower\u201d), entered into the Credit Agreement, which provides for a $25,000 Revolving Credit Facility and a $90,000 Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility, which we refer to collectively as the \u201cCredit Facilities,\u201d and repaid in full all borrowings outstanding under the Company\u2019s prior $25,000 asset-based revolving credit facility. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on the earlier of (i) February 10, 2026 and (ii) to the extent the sum of (x) the amount unused commitments under the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility and (y) the amount of loans under the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility exceeds $25,000 on such date, the date that is 180 days prior to February 10, 2026. The Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility matures on February 10, 2026. The Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility is available only to finance the acquisition of aircraft and engines and is not available for working capital or other general corporate purposes. Only the $25,000 Revolving Credit Facility portion of the Credit Facilities is available for general corporate purposes and as a general source of liquidity. During 2021, we drew $80,500 on the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility, and $77,481 remained outstanding on December 31, 2021.\nIn December\u00a02019, Sun Country arranged for the issuance of Class\u00a0A, Class\u00a0B and Class\u00a0C pass through trust certificates, Series\u00a02019-1 (the \u201c2019-1 EETC\u201d), in an aggregate face amount of $248,587 (the \u201cCertificates\u201d) for the purpose of financing or refinancing 13 used aircraft. The Certificates were issued to certain institutional investors, and the 2019-1 EETC face amount of the Certificates were funded by the purchase price paid by such investors for its Certificates on four funding dates from December\u00a02019 through June\u00a02020.\nOur primary uses of liquidity are for operating expenses, capital expenditures, lease rentals and maintenance reserve deposits, debt repayments and working capital requirements. Our single largest capital expenditure requirement relates to the acquisition of aircraft, which we have historically acquired through operating leases, finance leases, and debt. After our IPO in March of 2021, we began purchasing aircraft and engines with cash.\nWe plan to grow the passenger fleet to an estimated 50 aircraft by the end of 2023. We may finance additional aircraft through debt financing or finance leases based on market conditions, our prevailing level of liquidity and capital market availability. We may also enter into new operating leases on an opportunistic basis.\nIn addition to funding the acquisition of aircraft, we are required by our aircraft lessors to fund reserves in cash in advance for scheduled maintenance to act as collateral for the benefit of lessors. Qualifying payments that are expected to be recovered from lessors are recorded as Lessor Maintenance Deposits on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. A portion of our deposits is therefore unavailable until after we have completed the scheduled maintenance in accordance with the terms of the aircraft leases.\nWe believe that our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility, combined with expected future cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our debt payment obligations for at least the next twelve\u00a0months. However, we cannot predict what the effect on our business and financial position might be from a change in the competitive environment in which we operate or from events beyond our control, such as volatile fuel prices, economic conditions, pandemics, weather-related disruptions, the impact of airline bankruptcies, restructurings or consolidations, U.S. military actions, regulations, or acts of terrorism.\n97\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nDecember\u00a031,\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2021\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2020\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2019\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\u200b\n$\n 309,338\n\u200b\n$\n 62,028\n\u200b\n$\n 51,006\nInvestments\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 6,283\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 5,624\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 5,694\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nLong-term Debt\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 277,426\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 282,463\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 86,917\nFinance Lease Obligations\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 192,155\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 107,170\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 197,355\nOperating Lease Obligations\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 76,041\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 147,199\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 172,490\nTotal Debt and Lease obligations\n\u200b\n$\n 545,622\n\u200b\n$\n 536,832\n\u200b\n$\n 456,762\nStockholders' Equity\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 486,811\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 283,817\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 283,724\nTotal Invested Capital\n\u200b\n$\n 1,032,433\n\u200b\n$\n 820,649\n\u200b\n$\n 740,486\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nDebt-to-Capital\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 0.53\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 0.65\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 0.62\n\u200b\nSources and Uses of Liquidity\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nYear Ended December\u00a031,\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2021\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2020\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2019\nTotal Operating Activities\n\u200b\n$\n 152,013\n\u200b\n$\n 374\n\u200b\n$\n 63,272\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nInvesting Activities:\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nPurchases of Property & Equipment\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (116,369)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (96,298)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (69,816)\nOther\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (604)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 270\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 252\nTotal Investing Activities\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (116,973)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (96,028)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (69,564)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nFinancing Activities:\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nCash from Stock Offering, net\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 227,510\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\nProceeds from Borrowings\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 80,500\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 265,307\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 41,630\nProceeds Received for Amazon Warrants\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 4,667\nRepayment of Finance Leases\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (11,931)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (89,697)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (8,258)\nRepayment of Borrowings\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (85,370)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (69,906)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (10,153)\nDebt Issuance Costs\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (2,560)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (4,186)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (557)\nOther\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 4,233\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 21\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \u2014\nTotal Financing Activities\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 212,382\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 101,539\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 27,329\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nNet Increase in Cash\n\u200b\n$\n 247,422\n\u200b\n$\n 5,885\n\u200b\n$\n 21,037\n\u200b\n\u201cCash\u201d consists of Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nOperating Cash Flow Activities\nOperating activities in the year ended December 31, 2021 provided $152,013 of cash, as compared to providing $374 and $63,272 in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During those three year periods, Net Income (Loss) was $77,470, ($3,904) and $46,072, respectively.\nOur operating cash flow is primarily impacted by the following factors:\nSeasonality of Advance Ticket Sales.\n We sell tickets for air travel in advance of the customer's travel date. When we receive a cash payment at the time of sale, we record the cash received on advance sales as deferred revenue in Air Traffic Liabilities. Air Traffic Liabilities typically increase during the fall and early winter months as advanced ticket sales grow prior to the late winter and spring peak travel season and decrease during the summer months.\n98\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFuel.\n Fuel expense represented approximately 25%, 22% and 27% of our total operating expense for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The market price for jet fuel is volatile, which can impact the comparability of our periodic cash flows from operations. Fuel consumption increased during 2021 compared to prior year, consistent with increased passengers as the impact of the pandemic subsides.\nCARES Act.\n During the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2021 we received $71,587 in CARES Act grants. During the\u00a0year ended December\u00a031, 2020 we received $62,312 in CARES Act grants.\nInvesting Cash Flow Activities\nCapital Expenditures.\n Our capital expenditures were $116,369 and $96,298 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2021 were primarily related to the purchases of six existing aircraft previously under operating leases that were financed through draws on the Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility. Overall, we invested $97,388 to purchase seven aircraft (including the six noted above) and three engines in 2021, as compared to investing $88,561 on four aircraft and one engine in the 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we also purchased a flight simulator for $4,909.\nFinancing Cash Flow Activities\nIPO. \nOn March\u00a016, 2021, the Company offered 9,090,909 shares of common stock to the public at $24.00 per share. The underwriters had an option to purchase an additional 1,363,636 shares from the Company at the public offering price, which they exercised. In total, all 10,454,545 shares were issued and the net proceeds to the Company were $225,329 after deducting underwriting discounts\u00a0and commissions,\u00a0and other offering\u00a0expenses.\nDebt.\n In the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred $80,500 in new debt under the $90,000 Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility, primarily to purchase six aircraft, which were previously under operating leases. In 2020 we incurred $220,307 in debt under the 2019-1 EETC, primarily to purchase two aircraft new to the Company, purchase two aircraft which were previously under operating leases, purchase five aircraft which were previously under finance leases, as well as to refinance three other owned aircraft. In October 2020, we received a Cares Act Loan of $45,000 which was repaid in full on March 24, 2021. In addition, during 2021 we repaid $39,951 of other debt. In 2020, we repaid $89,697 toward finance lease obligations, primarily related to the buy-out of five aircraft. In 2020 we repaid $69,906 of outstanding debt, primarily related to the refinancing of three aircraft.\nFor additional information regarding these financing arrangements, see Note\u00a08 of the Notes\u00a0to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIndemnities\n. Our aircraft, equipment and other leases and certain operating agreements typically contain provisions requiring us, as the lessee, to indemnify the other parties to those agreements, including certain of those parties\u2019 related persons, against virtually any liabilities that might arise from the use or operation of the aircraft or such other equipment. We believe that our insurance covers most of our exposure to liabilities and related indemnities associated with the leases described above.\nPass-Through Trusts\n. We have equipment notes outstanding issued under the 2019-1 EETC. Generally, the structure of the EETC financings consists of pass-through trusts created by us to issue pass-through certificates, which represent fractional undivided interests in the respective pass-through trusts and are not obligations of Sun Country. The proceeds of the issuance of the pass-through certificates are used to purchase equipment notes which are issued by us and secured by our aircraft. The payment obligations under the equipment notes are those of Sun Country. We purchased or refinanced 13 aircraft utilizing these certificates and the obligations are listed in Note\u00a08\u00a0\u2013 Debt.\n99\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFuel Consortia\n. We currently participate in fuel consortia at Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport, Las Vegas International Airport, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, San Diego International Airport, Los Angeles International Airport, Seattle Tacoma International Airport, Portland International Airport, Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, Orlando International Airport and Southwest Florida International Airport and we expect to expand our participation with other airlines in fuel consortia and fuel committees at our airports where economically beneficial. These agreements generally include cost-sharing provisions and environmental indemnities that are generally joint and several among the participating airlines. Consortia that are governed by interline agreements are either (i)\u00a0not variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d) because they are not legal entities or (ii)\u00a0are variable interest entities but the Company is not deemed the primary beneficiary. Therefore, these agreements are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. There are no assets or liabilities on our balance sheets related to these VIEs, since our participation is limited to purchasing aircraft fuel.\nWe have no other off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nWe have contractual obligations comprised of aircraft leases and supplemental maintenance reserves, payment of debt and interest and other lease arrangements. As of December\u00a031, 2021, we also have a contractual obligation to pay our pre-IPO stockholders under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nThe agreement provides for the payment by the Company to the pre-IPO stockholders of 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign income tax that the Company realizes as a result of certain tax attributes that existed at the time of the IPO. For additional information regarding this agreement, see Note\u00a013 of the Notes\u00a0to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFor additional information, refer to Note 16 Commitments and Contingencies to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as described herein, there have been no material changes in our contractual obligations and commitments other than in the ordinary course of business since our fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.", "item7a": ">ITEM\u00a07A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are subject to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks include commodity price risk, specifically with respect to aircraft fuel, as well as interest rate risk. The adverse effects of changes in these markets could pose a potential loss as discussed below. The sensitivity analysis provided does not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity, nor does it consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes. Actual results may differ.\nAircraft Fuel\n. Unexpected pricing changes of aircraft fuel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. To hedge the economic risk associated with volatile aircraft fuel prices, we periodically enter into fuel collars, which allows us to reduce the overall cost of hedging, but may prevent us from participating in the benefit of downward price movements. In the past, we have also entered into fuel option and swap contracts. We had no hedges in place at December\u00a031, 2021. We had hedges in place during fiscal\u00a0year 2021, but the last of these hedges expired in September\u00a02021. We do not hold or issue option or swap contracts for trading purposes. We currently do not expect to enter into these types of contracts prospectively, although significant changes in market conditions could affect our decisions. Based on our forecasted scheduled service and charter fuel consumption for 2022, we estimate that a one cent per gallon increase in the average aircraft fuel price would increase aircraft fuel expense by approximately $851 excluding any impact associated with fuel derivative instruments held and reimbursed cargo fuel.\nInterest Rates\n. We have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related to the interest expense from our variable-rate debt. A change in market interest rates would impact interest expense under the Credit Facilities, totaling $115,000 principal capacity. Assuming the Credit Facilities are fully drawn, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a corresponding increase in interest expense of approximately $1,150 annually.\n\u200b\n100\n\n\nTable of Contents", "companyName": "Sun Country Airlines Holdings", "cusip": "866796105"}
