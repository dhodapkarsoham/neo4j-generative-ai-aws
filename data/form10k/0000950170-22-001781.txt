{"item1": ">Item 1. \nBusiness\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company driven by our mission to discover, develop and deliver life-changing treatments that provide hope to underserved patient communities, starting with sickle cell disease, or SCD. Founded in 2011, our goal is to transform the treatment and care of SCD, a lifelong, devastating inherited blood disorder that is marked by red blood cell, or RBC, destruction and occluded blood flow and hypoxia, which leads to anemia, stroke, multi-organ failure, severe pain crises, and shortened patient life span. SCD is also marked by a historical lack of understanding, investment and attention. Although the fundamental cause of SCD has been understood for decades, therapeutic innovation and access to care have historically lagged compared to many other rare diseases. For example, there are approximately three times more individuals in the United States living with SCD than cystic fibrosis. However, since the enactment of the Orphan Drug Act passed in 1983, only four drugs have been approved for SCD compared to at least 15 drugs approved for cystic fibrosis. As a result of the lack of treatment options, patients with SCD suffer serious morbidity and premature mortality.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe continue to make progress on our mission to bring innovative therapies to the SCD community. Our first medicine, Oxbryta, an oral therapy taken once daily, is the first and only FDA-approved treatment that directly inhibits sickle hemoglobin, or HbS, polymerization, the root cause of the sickling and destruction of red blood cells in SCD. Oxbryta was granted accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in November 2019, for the treatment of SCD in adults and children 12 years of age and older, and we have since continued to grow Oxbryta commercially, with the net number of patients taking Oxbryta increasing each quarter. In addition, in October 2021, Oxbryta was recognized by Prix Galien USA with the prestigious Best Biotechnology Product award.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have also been working to expand Oxbryta\u2019s reach to patients at younger ages as we believe early intervention is critically important for SCD patients. Starting a disease-modifying therapy earlier in life could potentially help prevent symptoms and end-organ damage that occurs over time in SCD patients. This could potentially improve the daily lives of children and their families, improve patient outcomes and lead to less utilization of healthcare, reducing healthcare costs for patients and families, and the overall healthcare system. In December 2021, the FDA granted accelerated approval to expand Oxbryta\u2019s indication for the treatment of SCD to children ages 4 to less than 12 years. The FDA also approved Oxbryta tablets for oral suspension, a dispersible, once-daily tablet dosage form suitable for patients ages 4 to less than 12 years as well as for older patients who have difficulty swallowing whole tablets. We will continue to study Oxbryta in patients as young as 6 months old to less than 4 years, as we look to potentially further expand access to Oxbryta.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWorldwide, there are millions of people living with SCD, which occurs predominantly in populations of African, Middle Eastern and South Asian descent and has an estimated global incidence of 250,000 to 300,000 births annually. We are executing what we view as a thoughtful and sustainable approach and will consider distribution and funding approaches to potentially provide access to our products globally, including in sub-Saharan Africa and India. Across our current focus areas of the United States, Europe, the Gulf Cooperation Council, or GCC, region of the Middle East, and Latin America, we believe there is an opportunity to bring Oxbryta to more than 350,000 people living with SCD in the next several years.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn February 2022, the European Commission, or EC, granted marketing authorization for Oxbryta for the treatment of hemolytic anemia (which is low hemoglobin due to red blood cell destruction) due to SCD in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older as monotherapy or in combination with hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea), and such authorization includes all Member States of the European Union, or EU, as well as the additional Member States of the European Economic Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). Prior to such EC approval, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, adopted in December 2021 a positive opinion recommending marketing authorization for Oxbryta, subsequent to which we submitted an application to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, in the United Kingdom for a Great Britain Marketing Authorisation using the EC Decision Reliance Procedure.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo provide early access to patients prior to potentially receiving marketing approval, we established early access and named patient programs for eligible SCD patients outside the United States, and enrollment in these programs has included patients located in the United Kingdom, France and Germany. The United Kingdom and France have the majority of SCD patients in Europe.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnder the exclusive agreement with our distribution partner, Biopharma-Middle East and Africa, or Biopharma-MEA, we continue to advance efforts to expand access to Oxbryta in the six countries that make up the GCC region (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman,\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nQatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, or UAE). In the GCC, the U.S. approval of Oxbryta can be referenced to allow access to the medicine while health authorities conduct their reviews. In the third quarter of 2021, we were granted marketing authorization for Oxbryta by the Ministry of Health and Prevention (MOHAP) in the UAE for the treatment of SCD in adults and children 12 years of age and older, with the UAE being the first country outside of the U.S. to grant regulatory approval of Oxbryta.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have ongoing and planned clinical trials in multiple countries to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of Oxbryta, including trials designed to demonstrate that improving hemoglobin and reducing hemolysis leads to an improvement in organ dysfunction. These trials include the Phase 2a HOPE-KIDS 1 Study, an open-label, single- and multiple-dose trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and exploratory treatment effect of Oxbryta in pediatric patients as young as 6 months of age. These trials also include the HOPE-KIDS 2 Study, a post-approval confirmatory study we initiated in December 2019 as a condition of the accelerated approval of Oxbryta in the United States, that is using transcranial Doppler, or TCD, flow velocity to seek to demonstrate a decrease in stroke risk in children with SCD 2 to 15 years of age.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBeyond Oxbryta, we are engaged in other research and development activities. Our development program includes inclacumab, a P-selectin inhibitor, currently in Phase 3 development to investigate its potential to reduce the incidence of painful vaso-occlusive crises, or VOCs and resulting hospital admissions. In addition, we are advancing GBT601, our next generation hemoglobin polymerization inhibitor that is in Phase 1 development and was discovered by our scientists. Our drug discovery teams continue to work on new targets to potentially develop the next wave of treatments for SCD. As part of our efforts to build our pipeline, we have entered into in-license and collaboration agreements and regularly evaluate opportunities to in-license, acquire or invest in new business, technology or assets or engage in related discussions with other business entities.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn March 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, declared a global pandemic related to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, and the pandemic has impacted our business, including our commercialization of Oxbryta and our research and development activities. For example, we have seen a significant decrease in weekly new patient prescriptions for Oxbryta from a peak in early March 2020, and we expect the rate of new patient prescriptions may remain lower depending on the course of the pandemic. While we have resumed most of our operations that were temporarily paused at the beginning of the pandemic, our approach in some cases has changed to adapt to the new environment, such as the increased use of digital and internet-based education and outreach to engage with healthcare professionals, or HCPs, and payors. We do not know how the adjustments we have made in our operations or the pandemic in general will impact our business in the long term. Notably, the pandemic has not significantly impacted our supply of Oxbryta. We continue to believe we have an adequate supply of Oxbryta to sustain estimated patient need through 2023, and we are continuing to produce Oxbryta tablets.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOverall, our business model is aligned with our social purpose, which is centered on highlighting the disparities and inequalities of people living with SCD. This includes helping to address these issues through education, support of and engagement with the SCD community, as well as charitable giving, such as through The GBT Foundation we established in 2021. We believe that fostering a values-driven culture, developing and supporting our people, and creating a more diverse, equitable and inclusive environment for our employees can help us to better deliver for SCD patients.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nStrategy\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are a dedicated leader in SCD with the goal of making SCD a well-managed chronic condition and to profoundly impact the disparities in healthcare these patients face. We believe that with Oxbryta, along with our innovative patient support program, GBT Source Solutions, we have established a strong track record of execution and have made an even stronger commitment to supporting the SCD community. Looking forward, we are working to build on the commercialization of Oxbryta in the United States, including through our focus on executing the launch of Oxbryta under the recently expanded label for ages 4 to less than 12 years; commercialize Oxbryta in the EU; expand clinical data supporting the use of Oxbryta in the approved population and in potentially younger patients; secure additional regulatory approvals and reimbursement in Europe and the Middle East; and pursue expansion to Latin America. We also have a strong pipeline of potential best-in-class therapies with inclacumab and GBT601, and we actively seek new innovations to complement our SCD portfolio and other rare diseases beyond SCD.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nKey elements of our strategy are as follows:\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBuild on the U.S. launch of Oxbryta\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn 2021, there were approximately 3,500 new prescriptions written for Oxbryta. Launch fundamentals remain strong despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to magnify health and economic disparities for underserved communities like those with SCD. In June 2020, the CDC identified SCD as one of a few underlying medical conditions that place adults of any age at increased risk of severe illness and death from the virus that causes COVID-19. We believe the pandemic continued to negatively impact SCD patient visits to HCPs in 2021, with documented impacts on SCD patient visits to healthcare prescribers and hospital\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\ninpatient admissions for VOCs. In addition, we have also seen a significant decrease in weekly new patient prescriptions for Oxbryta from a peak in early March 2020, and we expect the rate of new patient prescriptions may remain lower depending on the course of the pandemic.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDespite the impact of the pandemic, several positive drivers and dynamics drive our confidence in Oxbryta. The net number of patients taking Oxbryta has increased each quarter since its initial launch, and the growing body of real-world experience suggests that patients have improved overall health while taking Oxbryta. The market research we also conducted in December 2021 and January 2022 shows that physician awareness of Oxbryta is high: following the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting & Exposition in December 2021, half of the HCPs surveyed who attended recalled the presented real-world evidence on Oxbryta, which showed statistically significant reductions in VOCs, transfusions and hospitalization after Oxbryta use. This is important as more than half of the Oxbryta prescribers surveyed mentioned that this real-world evidence would significantly increase usage of Oxbryta, and more than 90% of non-prescribers said these data would motivate them to prescribe Oxbryta. Patient and caregiver awareness is also increasing, and the survey showed the highest awareness level since we began measuring. In addition, more than 70% of current Oxbryta patients said it works extremely well in keeping their SCD under control, and nearly all of current Oxbryta users responded that they are likely to recommend it to others. In addition, we have received positive feedback on education and marketing materials supporting our launch, including a groundbreaking direct-to-consumer advertising campaign launched in August 2021 focused on streaming platforms that are popular with our patients. In addition, GBT Source Solutions, our comprehensive program for patients, provides support for patients throughout their patient journey with a goal of improving overall adherence. In addition, in December 2021 the FDA granted accelerated approval to expand Oxbryta\u2019s indication for the treatment of SCD to children ages 4 to less than 12 years as well as accelerated approval of Oxbryta tablets for oral suspension, a dispersible, once-daily tablet dosage form.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGiven these drivers of momentum, we expect the demand for Oxbryta to continue in 2022:\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nWe deployed a variety of patient and healthcare provider marketing materials in support of the Oxbryta launch. These materials included traditional and digital advertisements, sponsored content, social media campaigns, patient starter kits, guides and brochures. In the third quarter of 2021, we launched a direct-to-consumer marketing campaign centered around a television commercial featuring actual Oxbryta patients and their families. We believe this commercial was the first of its kind in SCD and that it will have a positive impact on patients\u2019 awareness and adoption of Oxbryta.\n\n\n\u2022\nGBT Source Solutions provides support by reviewing insurance coverage options and explaining benefits, working with the specialty pharmacy partner network to coordinate delivery of Oxbryta to wherever the patient chooses, helping with financial and co-pay assistance for eligible patients, and helping patients stay on treatment as prescribed by their treating physicians with a nurse support team. GBT Source Solutions is supported by a team of highly trained professionals and regional, field-based patient navigators that will help patients and provide resources to help HCPs understand insurance requirements and other administrative details when prescribing Oxbryta. In early 2021, we transitioned to exclusively providing the GBT Source Solutions high-touch model, which includes early contact to introduce the program, explain how the patient will interact with team members, and provide patient starter kits and adherence tools. Those tools include a treatment journal, a side effects management tip sheet, and bottle and app-linked reminders for daily dosing. We believe these tools will help patients better navigate the start of their treatments and help overall adherence. In early 2021, we launched a website associated with GBT Source Solutions, www.GBTSource.com, to provide information for patients, caregivers and HCPs about starting and staying on Oxbryta.\n\n\n\u2022\nOur field team, which consists of approximately 55 Sickle Cell Therapeutic Specialists and 10 Regional Business Directors at the end of 2021, is engaging with approximately 4,700 targeted HCPs, including HCPs that focus on pediatric patients with SCD, to educate them on Oxbryta\u2019s broad label. \n\n\n\u2022\nWe update our education materials as new Oxbryta clinical data is presented at medical meetings and/or published into the scientific literature. Most recently, in December 2021, we presented Oxbryta data at the ASH Annual Meeting & Exposition, including results from a large retrospective analysis of 3,128 SCD patients treated with Oxbryta that showed a statistically significant improvement in hemoglobin levels and statistically significant reductions in transfusions, VOCs and hospitalizations. In addition, we presented data from the open-label extension, or OLE, of the Phase 3 HOPE Study and from the Retrospective Study to Evaluate Outcomes in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease Treated with Oxbryta (RETRO) Study that confirmed the safety and efficacy of Oxbryta use, including long-term use, in SCD patients ages 12 and older. \n\n\n\u2022\nIn October 2021, Oxbryta was awarded the prestigious 2021 Prix Galien USA Award for Best Biotechnology Product. The Prix Galien award is among the global health industry's most renowned honors, recognizing outstanding product achievements that improve the human condition. Oxbryta was selected among 19 nominees by a committee of 12 leaders from the biotech industry and academia, including five Nobel Laureates.\n\n\n\u2022\nIn December 2021, the FDA approved our sNDA for the use of Oxbryta for children as young as 4 years of age as well as our NDA for a new dispersible tablet formulation. As a result of the approval of such sNDA, we have increased the \n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\npatient population that could be eligible for a prescription to Oxbryta to greater than 100,000 SCD patients in the United States.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nExpand clinical data and potential approved product labeling supporting Oxbryta\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe accelerated approval of Oxbryta was based on results from our Phase 3 HOPE (Hemoglobin Oxygen Affinity Modulation to Inhibit HbS PolymErization) Study and our open-label Phase 2a HOPE-KIDS 1 Study, which showed that treatment with Oxbryta leads to clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in hemoglobin levels, accompanied by reductions in RBC destruction (hemolysis), in patients age 12 and older and age 4 to less than 12, respectively.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have a comprehensive plan to continue to build clinical evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of Oxbryta. This plan includes clinical trials designed to demonstrate that improving hemoglobin and reducing hemolysis leads to an improvement in organ dysfunction (as assessed in various organs). Our clinical trials include the Phase 2a HOPE-KIDS 1 Study, the Phase 3 HOPE-KIDS 2 Study and other clinical trials of Oxbryta to further study the efficacy and safety profile of Oxbryta for SCD patients in real-world use. The Phase 2a HOPE-KIDS 1 Study, an open-label, single- and multiple-dose trial, is evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and exploratory treatment effect of Oxbryta in pediatric patients as young as 6 months of age. The HOPE-KIDS 2 Study, a post-approval confirmatory study we initiated in December 2019 as a condition of the accelerated approval of Oxbryta in the United States, is using TCD flow velocity to seek to demonstrate a decrease in stroke risk in children with SCD 2 to 15 years of age.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn mid-2021, we initiated the Retrospective Study to Evaluate Outcome in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease Treated with Oxbryta (RETRO) and the Registry to Evaluate Long-Term Safety and Effectiveness of Oxbryta in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease (PROSPECT) data registries to enable deeper understanding of Oxbryta\u2019s long-term efficacy and safety. Initial results from the RETRO study were presented at the European Hematology Association, or EHA, 2021 Virtual Congress in June 2021 and at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting & Exposition in December 2021, showing that Oxbryta treatment was associated with increased hemoglobin levels and decreased hemolytic markers. We expect to present additional findings from the RETRO study and initial results from the PROSPECT study in 2022.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, we are planning a comprehensive program to gather and evaluate real world evidence and historical data to further evaluate the long-term connection between improvements in hemoglobin and organ damage and longer-term outcomes, with an initial focus on stroke and silent infarct. We also plan to study the potential effects of Oxbryta on blood flow within the brain, neurocognitive function and leg ulcer healing. These and other aspects of our overall clinical development program for Oxbryta are also intended to position us to be able to seek potential approval over time for product labeling for Oxbryta for patients younger than the current age limit (4 years old), down to as young as 9 months of age.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nExpand the approved use of Oxbryta in Europe, the Middle East and Latin America\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn Europe, there are approximately 52,000 SCD patients, the majority of whom are in two countries, the United Kingdom and France. In December 2020, we initiated an early access program in Europe and other regions outside the United States, for the treatment of hemolytic anemia in SCD patients ages 12 years and older. Through the program, physicians in countries with an early access regulatory and legal pathway may be able to request voxelotor for eligible SCD patients who do not have access to the medicine as part of a clinical trial. Early access programs are enrolling eligible SCD patients in the United Kingdom, France and Germany, three key European markets in SCD.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn January 2021, the EMA accepted for review our Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, seeking full marketing authorization of Oxbryta to treat hemolytic anemia (which is low hemoglobin due to red blood cell destruction) in SCD patients ages 12 years and older; in December 2021, the CHMP of the EMA adopted a positive opinion recommending marketing authorization for Oxbryta as monotherapy or in combination with hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea); and, in February 2022, the EC granted marketing authorization for Oxbryta for the treatment of hemolytic anemia due to SCD in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older as monotherapy or in combination with hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea). The EC marketing authorization includes all Member States of the European Union, or EU, as well as the additional Member States of the European Economic Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway).\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe MAA was based on data from our Phase 3 HOPE Study and our Phase 2 HOPE-KIDS 1 Study, both of which enrolled patients at clinical sites in Europe. The EMA has included Oxbryta in its Priority Medicines (PRIME) scheme, and the EC has designated Oxbryta as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of patients with SCD. \n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn June 2021, Oxbryta became the first and only SCD treatment to receive the Promising Innovative Medicine (PIM) designation from the MHRA in the United Kingdom. Following the positive opinion from the CHMP, recommending the approval of Oxbryta in the EU, we submitted an application to the MHRA for a Great Britain Marketing Authorisation using the EC Decision Reliance Procedure. In January 2022, the MHRA awarded a positive scientific opinion under the Early Access to Medicines Scheme (EAMS) for Oxbryta, which means that UK patients living with SCD and meeting eligibility criteria may have access to Oxbryta while the MHRA completes its review of the MAA. \n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the GCC region, where there are estimated to be more than 100,000 SCD patients age 12 years and older, we established an exclusive agreement with Biopharma-MEA to potentially secure regulatory approvals and distribute Oxbryta in the region. In the GCC region, the U.S. approval of Oxbryta can be referenced to allow for access to the medicine while health authorities conduct their reviews. In the third quarter of 2021, we were granted marketing authorization for Oxbryta by the MOHAP in the UAE for the treatment of SCD in adults and children 12 years of age and older, with the UAE being the first country outside of the U.S. where Oxbryta was approved.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn Latin America, where there are approximately 100,000 SCD patients, mostly in Brazil, we plan to establish a distribution agreement with a local partner to potentially secure regulatory approvals and distribute Oxbryta in this market.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdvance our innovative pipeline: inclacumab, GBT601 and other next-generation treatments\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur strategy includes the expansion of our product pipeline through the discovery and development of novel therapeutic approaches for SCD and grievous blood disorders, and such efforts include our internal programs of inclacumab and GBT601 and an early-stage research program under our collaboration with Syros Pharmaceuticals, Inc, or Syros. In addition, our internal drug discovery and business development teams actively work on new opportunities to potentially expand our product pipeline. For example, in March 2021, we entered into an agreement with Sanofi S.A., or Sanofi, to exclusively in-license worldwide rights to two early-stage research programs in SCD: one that pursues a novel anti-sickling mechanism and another that leverages a new approach to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress. These mechanisms are distinct and potentially complementary to that of Oxbryta. The following table summarizes our approved product and our most advanced research and development programs:\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHbF, fetal hemoglobin; POC, proof-of-concept.\n \n\n\n*Approval includes EU member states and Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. For the UK, GBT has submitted an application to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for a Great Britain Marketing Authorisation using the EC Decision Reliance Procedure.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur lead development candidate, inclacumab, is a novel fully human monoclonal antibody against P-selectin, which is a clinically validated target in SCD, known to reduce the incidence of VOCs. We licensed inclacumab from F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (together, \u201cRoche\u201d) in August 2018. Prior to licensing inclacumab to us, Roche conducted clinical studies that enrolled more than 700 non-SCD patients and demonstrated an encouraging pharmacokinetic, safety, and tolerability\n \n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nprofile for inclacumab. We are leveraging the safety data from Roche\u2019s prior clinical studies in our development of inclacumab as a potential treatment to reduce the frequency of VOCs in patients with SCD and to reduce the hospital VOC readmission rate for patients that require inpatient treatment for an initial VOC episode. We initiated enrollment of patients in two pivotal clinical trials in the second half of 2021. One study is a chronic prevention study with an endpoint of the reduction in VOCs over a 48-week treatment period, and the other study is focusing on hospital readmissions with an endpoint of the reduction of the rate of readmission to hospitals for VOC within 90 days following an initial hospitalization for VOC.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlso in development is our next generation hemoglobin polymerization inhibitor, GBT601, a molecule discovered and designed by our scientists. GBT601 has the same mechanism of action as Oxbryta, but with the potential for greater efficacy by achieving higher hemoglobin occupancy at significantly lower doses. In December 2021, we presented data from our Phase 1 clinical trials of GBT601 at the 63rd ASH Annual Meeting and Exposition and our R&D Day. The Phase 1 data showed that GBT601 was well tolerated in healthy volunteers and SCD patients and demonstrated average hemoglobin occupancy greater than 30% after three weeks of treatment with a daily maintenance dose of 100 mg in the cohort of six patients with SCD receiving multiple ascending doses of GBT601. During study treatment, all six patients demonstrated improvements in hematologic parameters, including reticulocytes and absolute reticulocytes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and indirect bilirubin. In addition, improvements in red blood cell health were seen in all patients as assessed by Oxygenscan testing. We believe these Phase 1 study results provide proof of concept that a relatively low dose of GBT601 in a once-daily pill may achieve high target Hb occupancies. Incorporation of these data into our pharmacokinetic model predicts that even higher hemoglobin occupancies may be achieved at relatively low doses, thus enabling our further clinical development GBT601. We expect to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial of GBT601 in SCD patients by mid-2022.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWhile still in early stages, we have an ongoing collaboration with Syros, under a License and Collaboration Agreement, or the Syros Agreement, entered into in December 2019, to discover, develop and commercialize novel therapies for SCD and beta thalassemia. We are currently exploring orally available, small molecule drugs designed to upregulate fetal hemoglobin. An increase in fetal hemoglobin by 10% to 30% can dilute the concentration of deoxygenated hemoglobin S, which can participate in polymerization, and prevent hemoglobin polymers from forming. Upregulating levels of fetal hemoglobin could be pharmacologically curative for SCD as well as beta thalassemia. Under the Syros Agreement, we have an option to obtain an exclusive worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize any compounds or products resulting from the collaboration, subject to Syros\u2019 option to co-promote the first product in the United States.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn March 2021, we entered into a license agreement with Sanofi, or the Sanofi Agreement, to exclusively in-license worldwide rights to two early-stage research programs in SCD: one that pursues a novel anti-sickling mechanism and another that leverages a new approach to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress. These mechanisms are distinct and potentially complementary to that of Oxbryta. The programs, from Sanofi\u2019s Bioverativ subsidiary, supplement our existing pipeline and support our strategy to address SCD from multiple approaches. Under the terms of the Sanofi Agreement, we will conduct all research, development, regulatory and commercialization activities worldwide. Sanofi received an upfront payment of $2.25 million and is entitled to payments up to approximately $351.0 million upon achievement of certain development, regulatory, commercial and sales-based milestones and single-digit tiered royalties on worldwide net sales.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nImprove care for SCD patients worldwide\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe majority of the global SCD patient population is outside of the United States, including more than 75% of the global incidence in sub-Saharan Africa and large populations in India, the Middle East and Latin America. Each of these regions represent unique challenges to providing access due to complex healthcare systems and will require a customizable approach that meets the needs of the local community. Our clinical programs include sites outside of the United States, and participants in our clinical trials have an opportunity to continue to receive Oxbryta until it is commercially available in their countries. We are developing strategies to make Oxbryta available to all patients in these regions in a manner that is sustainable for us over the long term. In addition, we believe that the potential profile of GBT601 could further enhance the broad access potential of our medicines not only in the United States, but for patients around the world.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nKey 2021 Highlights\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRegulatory/Commercial\n \n\n\n\u2022\nIn 2021, we continued to execute the commercial launch of Oxbryta in the United States, leveraging our field team and GBT Source Solutions to educate HCPs, payors and other stakeholders on Oxbryta. \n\n\n\u2022\nWe recognized Oxbryta net revenues of $194.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, and recorded approximately 3,500 new prescriptions. \n\n\n\u2022\nIn early 2021, we launched patient starter kits and new sales materials in the United States to provide deeper education on Oxbryta and increase patient adherence, and launched www.gbtsource.com, which provides information for patients, \n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\ncaregivers and health professionals on GBT Source Solutions, our dedicated SCD patient support program that helps eligible patients start and stay on Oxbryta. In early 2021, we transitioned GBT Source Solutions to a 100% high-touch model to support better conversion and adherence rates.\n \n\n\n\u2022\nIn January 2021, we received acceptance for review from the EMA of Oxbryta\u2019s MAA seeking full marketing approval to treat hemolytic anemia in patients with SCD 12 years of age and older. The EMA previously granted Oxbryta PRIME designation, and the EC designated Oxbryta as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of patients with SCD.\n\n\n\u2022\nIn July 2021, we launched the first branded direct-to-consumer television advertising campaign in SCD to educate and empower patients. We also furthered our education and brand commitment efforts with the launch of a video titled \u201cMechanism of Sickle Cell Disease\u201d on SickleCellSpeaks.com, to help people learn about SCD and how it affects the body. \n\n\n\u2022\nIn June 2021, Oxbryta became the first and only SCD treatment to receive the PIM designation from the MHRA in the United Kingdom. \n\n\n\u2022\nIn September 2021, we submitted and received validation of an application for approval of Oxbryta tablets in the UAE and we were granted marketing authorization for Oxbryta by the MOHAP in the UAE for the treatment of SCD in adults and children 12 years of age and older, with the UAE being the first country outside of the U.S. where Oxbryta was approved. \n\n\n\u2022\nIn December 2021, the FDA granted accelerated approval for Oxbryta for the treatment of SCD in children ages 4 to less than 12 years. Concurrently, the FDA approved a new formulation for Oxbryta tablets for oral suspension, a dispersible, once-daily tablet dosage form suitable for patients ages 4 to less than 12 years as well as for older patients who have difficulty swallowing whole tablets.\n\n\n\u2022\nIn December 2021, the CHMP adopted a positive opinion recommending marketing authorization for Oxbryta as monotherapy or in combination with hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea). During 2021, expanded access programs were initiated in France, German and the UK. In France, Oxbryta was granted Temporary Authorization for Use (cATU), providing early access to patients; in Germany, a compassionate use program for Oxbryta was approved by the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM); and in the UK, Oxbryta was provided on a named patient basis.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSCD Community\n \n\n\n\u2022\nIn June 2021, we awarded approximately $450,000 to U.S. community-based organizations and institutions as part of our 2021 Access to Excellent Care for Sickle Cell Patients (ACCEL) Grant Program. The program provides support to accelerate the development of sustainable access-to-care programs for people living with SCD. \n\n\n\u2022\nIn September 2021, we launched The GBT Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization and source of charitable giving that will work to improve the health and well-being of underserved patient communities around the world. Its mission is to fund programs that will support people within the SCD community and beyond through education, empowerment, improved healthcare access and enhanced health equity.\n\n\n\u2022\nIn September 2021, we hosted the 10th Annual SCD Therapeutics Conference, which highlighted the latest advancements and future trends for treating patients with SCD. The event featured sessions on a variety of critical topics, including the impact of the novel COVID-19 vaccines and the experiences of the SCD community with these vaccines.\n\n\n\u2022\nIn October 2021, we supported the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America\u2019s (SCDAA) 49th Annual National Convention as the Diamond sponsor, to help address the multifactorial aspects of SCD and foster the exchange of the latest scientific and clinical information.\n\n\n\u2022\nIn December 2021, we provided a grant of $400,000 to the ASH RC in support of The ASH Research Collaborative (ASH RC) Data Hub Sickle Cell Disease program. With the Data Hub SCD program, the ASH RC seeks to advance research and outcomes for people living with SCD by expanding its current data collection of real-world, research-grade data to include more than half of people living with SCD in the United States. GBT is the first biopharmaceutical company to provide the ASH RC with financial support.\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nMedical Meeting Presentations and Publications\n \n\n\n\u2022\nIn April 2021, the complete 72-week results from the Phase 3 HOPE Study of Oxbryta were published in The Lancet Haematology. The results showed significant and sustained improvement in hemoglobin levels, reduction in hemolysis and improved overall health status in patients treated with Oxbryta.\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nIn April 2021, we presented a poster at the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy 2021 Meeting highlighting a large-scale, longitudinal analysis demonstrating that increased hemoglobin levels in adult patients with SCD significantly reduced the risk of developing new end-organ damage.\n\n\n\u2022\nIn April 2021, results from a single-center analysis including 76 patients (age 12-70) with SCD were presented at the American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Conference, reinforcing the efficacy and safety of treatment with Oxbryta in a real-world setting. In addition, the results demonstrated that when measured by the patient and clinical global impressions of change scale, the majority of patients were rated much improved or very much improved.\n\n\n\u2022\nIn June 2021, we presented six abstracts at the EHA 2021 Virtual Congress, including an oral session presentation on the first reporting of results from the Phase 2a HOPE-KIDS 1 Study in children with SCD ages 4 to 11 years treated with Oxbryta, which showed an improvement in hemoglobin and hemolysis in these patients. In addition, results from two real-world evidence studies of Oxbryta were presented that showed sustained improvements in hemoglobin with Oxbryta treatment, consistent with results from the Phase 3 HOPE Study.\n\n\n\u2022\nIn October 2021, we presented a poster at The Foundation for Sickle Cell Disease Research\u2019s (FSCDR) Inaugural Nursing in Sickle Cell Disease Symposium demonstrating that pediatric patients (aged 4-11 years) experience improvements in health-related quality of life after initiating therapy with Oxbryta.\n\n\n\u2022\nIn December 2021, we presented six abstracts related to our SCD programs at the ASH Annual Meeting & Exposition, including additional data on the real-world experience with Oxbryta, long-term data from the open-label extension of the Phase 3 HOPE trial, initial data from the Phase 1 trials of GBT601 in healthy volunteers and SCD patients, and an analysis of data from the Phase 1 trial of inclacumab in healthy volunteers.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nClinical and Research & Development\n\n\n\u2022\nIn January 2021, we began enrolling patients in our pediatric expanded access protocol (EAP), which provided access to Oxbryta in the United States prior to approval for children ages 4 to 11 years with SCD who had no alternative treatment options and were ineligible to participate in clinical trials of Oxbryta. Later in 2021, we increased the number of patients planned for this EAP from 50 to up to 150 due to strong interest from HCPs, SCD patients and their caregivers. Now that Oxbryta is approved in the United States for SCD patients ages 4 to 11 years, we are working to transition these EAP patients to commercial product.\n\n\n\u2022\nIn March 2021, we entered into an agreement with Sanofi S.A. to exclusively in-license worldwide rights to two early-stage research programs in SCD: one that pursues a novel anti-sickling mechanism and another that leverages a new approach to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress.\n\n\n\u2022\nIn the second quarter of 2021, we initiated the RETRO and PROSPECT data registries to enable deeper understanding of Oxbryta\u2019s long-term efficacy and safety. Initial results from the RETRO study were presented at the EHA 2021 Virtual Congress in June and at the ASH Annual Meeting & Exposition in December 2021, and initial results from the PROSPECT study are anticipated in 2022.\n\n\n\u2022\nIn July 2021, we initiated two global, randomized, placebo-controlled, pivotal Phase 3 trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of inclacumab, our P-selectin inhibitor, for the reduction of VOC frequency and VOC-related hospital readmissions, respectively. By the end of 2021, each study had enrolled its first patient and enrollment is expected to continue in 2022. \n\n\n\u2022\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we announced results from the Phase 1 trials of GBT601 in healthy volunteers and SCD patients. We believe such results provide proof of concept that we can achieve average hemoglobin occupancy greater than 30% in SCD patients with a daily dose less than 500 mg and support further development of GBT601. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCorporate\n \n\n\n\u2022\nIn March 2021, Alexis A. Thompson, M.D., M.P.H., a world-renowned hematologist and SCD expert, was appointed to our board of directors. Dr. Thompson, who brings decades of experience in clinical research, patient care, leadership and advocacy in hematology, serves on the board\u2019s research and development committee.\n\n\n\u2022\nIn May 2021, Kim Smith-Whitley, M.D., a global SCD thought leader and advocate, joined GBT as executive vice president and head of research and development and a member of our senior management team. Dr. Smith-Whitley is a board-certified pediatric hematologist and was most recently clinical director of hematology and director of the Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\n\n\u2022\nIn August 2021, Carrie Krehlik, a results-oriented leader with experience leading teams in large-, mid-, and small-market multi-national companies, joined GBT as chief human resources officer. Prior to GBT, she most recently served as senior \n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nvice president and chief human resources officer for Adicet Bio, Inc., where she established the people strategy for the company.\n\n\n\u2022\nIn September 2021, we launched The GBT Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization and source of charitable giving that will work to improve the health and well-being of underserved patient communities around the world. We established The GBT Foundation to fund programs that will support people within the SCD community and beyond through education, empowerment, improved healthcare access and enhanced health equity.\n\n\n\u2022\nIn October 2021, GBT and Oxbryta received the prestigious 2021 Prix Galien USA award for \u201cBest Biotechnology Product\u201d from The Galien Foundation. Oxbryta was selected among 19 nominees by a committee of 12 leaders from the biotech industry and academia, including five Nobel Laureates.\n\n\n\u2022\nIn December 2021, we issued an aggregate of $345.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.875% convertible senior notes due 2028 in a private placement and we entered into an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement with funds managed by Pharmakon Advisors LP, under which we increased our previous loan by $100 million to a total of $250 million. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSickle Cell Disease Overview\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSCD is a devastating and rare inherited blood disorder that impacts hemoglobin, a protein carried by RBCs that delivers oxygen to tissues and organs throughout the body. It attacks every organ in the body and causes a wide range of complications, including inflammation, multi-organ damage and failure and early death. Many of these start with anemia and hemolysis. Beginning in childhood, patients can suffer unpredictable and recurrent episodes or crises of severe pain due to blocked blood flow to organs, which often lead to physical and psychosocial disability. In addition, the constant destruction of RBCs and the release of their contents into the blood often leads to damaged or diseased blood vessels, which further exacerbate blood flow obstruction and multi-organ damage. Consequences of SCD can manifest in early childhood and may include stroke, spleen failure, pulmonary hypertension, acute chest syndrome, liver disease, kidney failure, leg ulcers, priapism, which is a medical emergency due to refractory penile erection, and premature death. In the United States, SCD has been estimated to shorten patient life expectancy by approximately 30 years even with available medical care.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSCD is a genetic blood disorder caused by a single gene mutation in the beta-chain of hemoglobin, which results in mutant hemoglobin known as HbS. Hemoglobin is the protein in RBCs that carries oxygen from the lungs to the body\u2019s tissues, releases oxygen at the tissues, and returns carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs. Hemoglobin accomplishes this by binding and then releasing oxygen through allosterism, which means the hemoglobin molecule changes its shape to have a high affinity for oxygen in the lungs, where oxygen is abundant, and to have a low affinity for oxygen in the tissues, where oxygen must be released. Oxyhemoglobin, the high oxygen affinity form of hemoglobin, is formed in the lungs during respiration, when oxygen binds to the hemoglobin molecule. Deoxyhemoglobin, the low oxygen affinity form of hemoglobin, is formed when oxygen molecules are removed from the binding site as blood flows from the lungs to the tissues in the body. In patients with SCD, deoxygenated HbS molecules polymerize to form long, rigid rods within an RBC, much like a \u201csword within a balloon.\u201d As a consequence, the normally round and flexible RBC becomes rigid and elongates into a \u201csickled\u201d shape. Sickled RBCs do not flow properly in the bloodstream; they clog small blood vessels and reduce blood flow to the organs. This results in inadequate oxygen delivery, or hypoxia, to all body tissues, which can lead to multi-organ failure and premature death.\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nThe following graphic illustrates the process by which sickling occurs in SCD patients as a result of the polymerization of deoxygenated HbS in an RBC, leading to the breakdown of RBCs, which can cause anemia, and/or occluded blood flow. Both anemia and occluded blood flow can lead to multi-organ dysfunction.\n \n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRBC, red blood cell; GU, genitourinary\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSCD manifests in individuals who inherit at least one HbS gene from a parent and an additional mutation on the second beta globin gene from the other parent. There are several different genotypes of SCD, including the following major genotypes:\n \n\n\n\u2022\nHbSS, or sickle cell anemia, where both genes are HbS; \n\n\n\u2022\nHbSC, where one gene is HbS, and the other is HbC (inherited from a non-SCD impacted parent); and \n\n\n\u2022\nHbS/\u00dfthal, where one gene is HbS, and the other is Beta thalassemia. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSCD Patient and Community Impact\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe CDC has estimated the prevalence of SCD at more than 100,000 individuals in the United States. The incidence of SCD is estimated at approximately 1 in 2,000 to 2,500 newborns in the United States. In addition, there are an estimated 52,000 individuals in Europe, more than 100,000 people age 12 years and older in the GCC region and approximately 100,000 individuals in Latin America, primarily in Brazil, living with the disease. SCD occurs predominantly in populations of African, Middle Eastern and South Asian descent, and the global incidence of is estimated to be 250,000 to 300,000 births annually. While newborn screening is mandatory in the United States, Brazil, Costa Rica, France, United Kingdom, Spain and Netherlands, it remains inconsistent in countries throughout other regions of the world including Europe, Latin America, Middle East, South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOf SCD patients in the United States, approximately 45% are under the age of 18, and approximately 60% to 65% have the HbSS genotype, which is often referred to as sickle cell anemia, with the remaining 35% to 40% having other genotypes. In all genotypes of SCD, the mechanism that leads to the consequences of the disease involves the polymerization of HbS in its deoxygenated state, which results in RBC sickling. Our Phase 3 HOPE Study included SCD patients with all genotypes of SCD, and showed Oxbryta is active across all SCD genotypes. As a result, Oxbryta is approved for use with all SCD genotypes.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSCD is associated with a high healthcare utilization and economic burden. It is estimated that in the United States, the annual cost of medical care for an SCD patient with complications is up to $286,000 and that end-organ damage drives major healthcare utilization, with an average SCD patient receiving healthcare services for 30 to 54 days per year. In addition, there is potential for a significant financial burden on patients and society: it is estimated that SCD patients are deprived of approximately $700,000 in lost lifetime income, not including the impact on caregiver productivity. As a result, we believe that safe, effective and convenient oral treatments for SCD have the potential to be well received by patients, physicians and payors.\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nNearly 50% of SCD patients will experience one or more VOCs in a year. At least 80% of all hospitalizations of SCD patients are for a VOC, and in around 50% of these cases, the patient will be readmitted within 90 days for another VOC, adding to the cost of the index hospitalization. As a result, we believe that a safe, effective and convenient treatment that can reduce the frequency of VOCs and related hospital readmissions has the potential to be well received by patients, physicians and payors.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOther Current Treatment Options\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThere has historically been limited innovation in the development of SCD therapies and there remains a significant unmet medical need for SCD patients. In recent years this has begun to change, including the FDA approval of Oxbryta in November 2019, and a significant increase in orphan drug approvals by the FDA. However, there are limitations to other currently approved treatment options.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe first drug approved to treat SCD, known as hydroxyurea, which was initially approved as a chemotherapy drug, was approved by the FDA in 1998 for the treatment of sickle cell anemia in adults with three or more painful crises per year. The use of hydroxyurea is significantly limited by its side effect profile, variable patient responses and concerns regarding long-term toxicity. Hydroxyurea\u2019s side effects include impairment of fertility, suppression of white blood cells, or neutropenia, and suppression of platelets, or thrombocytopenia, which place patients at risk for infection and bleeding.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn July 2017, the FDA approved L-glutamine oral powder for patients age five and older with SCD to reduce severe complications associated with the disorder. In January 2018, Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc., the marketer for Endari\n\u00ae\n(L-glutamine oral powder) announced the availability of the product to patients. Endari is supplied to patients as powder that requires a large volume administration (5 grams\u201415 grams) mixed with liquid or food twice a day.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn November 2019, the FDA approved Adakveo\n\u00ae\n (crizanlizumab) to reduce the frequency of VOCs, or pain crises, in adult and pediatric patients aged 16 years and older with SCD, and it was made available to patients before the end of 2019. Crizanlizumab is administered via a 30-minute intravenous, or IV, infusion given once per month by a health care provider.\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition to treatment with hydroxyurea, L-glutamine and crizanlizumab, transfusions with normal blood are an option to help alleviate anemia, which is a common symptom of SCD, and reduce sickling of RBCs. Blood transfusions have a number of limitations, including the expense of treatment, lack of uniform accessibility and risks ranging from allergic reactions to serious complications such as blood-borne infection and iron overload, which can cause organ damage. The only potentially curative treatment currently available for SCD patients is bone marrow transplantation, which requires a suitable matching donor and carries significant risks, including an approximately 5% mortality rate. Despite these other current treatment options, blood transfusion and palliative therapy for acute pain attacks, patients with SCD continue to suffer serious morbidity and premature mortality.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn light of the devastating effects of SCD on patients and the high costs of care for these patients, there has been a significant unmet need for a treatment that:\n \n\n\n\u2022\ninhibits abnormal hemoglobin polymer formation, the underlying mechanism of RBC sickling; \n\n\n\u2022\nstops inappropriate RBC destruction and improves blood flow and oxygen delivery to tissues; \n\n\n\u2022\nreduces hemolytic anemia that leads to chronic organ damage and early mortality in patients with SCD; \n\n\n\u2022\nprevents or reduces the episodes or crises of severe pain associated with SCD; \n\n\n\u2022\nmodifies the long-term course of the disease; \n\n\n\u2022\nis effective in all SCD genotypes and in both children and adults; \n\n\n\u2022\nhas a more favorable side effect profile than currently available therapies; and \n\n\n\u2022\nis available as a convenient, oral therapy. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, while there have been therapies approved to treat patients with VOCs, or pain crises, there remains an opportunity to improve care with a treatment that:\n \n\n\n\u2022\nsimilar to crizanlizumab, reduces the frequency of VOCs, but with a more convenient dosing schedule; and \n\n\n\u2022\nreduces the hospital re-admission rate due to VOCs in patients that are admitted to the hospital for a VOC. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOxbryta \u2013 A First-in-Class, Once-Daily Oral Therapy\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn November 2019, we received FDA accelerated approval for Oxbryta for the treatment of SCD in adults and children 12 years of age and older, and in December 2021, we received FDA accelerated approval for Oxbryta for the treatment of SCD in children ages 4 to less than 12 years. Concurrently with the approval of the expanded label, the FDA approved a new formulation for Oxbryta: tablets for oral suspension, a dispersible, once-daily tablet dosage form suitable for patients ages 4 to less than 12 years as well as for older patients who have difficulty swallowing whole tablets. Oxbryta, an oral, once-daily therapy, is the first FDA-approved treatment that directly inhibits sickle hemoglobin polymerization, the root cause of SCD. In addition, Oxbryta was recently approved for\n \n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nmarketing in the EU for the treatment of hemolytic anemia due to SCD in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older as monotherapy or in combination with hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea), and in the UAE for the treatment of SCD in adults and children 12 years of age and older.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe believe the U.S. label for Oxbryta highlights several important attributes for physicians and patients, including:\n \n\n\n\u2022\nA broad indication for use with no hemoglobin level restrictions and no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics based on age, sex, body weight or mild to severe renal impairment; \n\n\n\u2022\nA specific description of Oxbryta as a hemoglobin S polymerization inhibitor that may inhibit RBC sickling, improve RBC deformability, and reduce whole blood viscosity; \n\n\n\u2022\nNo restriction on use with or without hydroxyurea; and \n\n\n\u2022\nClinical data highlights from the Phase 3 HOPE Study, including the subject-level change from baseline in hemoglobin at week 24 in patients who completed 24 weeks of treatment with Oxbryta 1500 mg dose or placebo, and data from the open-label Phase 2a HOPE-KIDS 1 Study. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOverview of Hemoglobin Biology and Oxbryta\u2019s Mechanism of Action\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHemoglobin transports oxygen from the lungs to the body\u2019s tissues, releases oxygen into the tissues, and returns carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs by changing its shape to be high affinity for oxygen in the lungs, where oxygen is abundant, and low affinity for oxygen in the tissues, where oxygen must be released. An important tool for assessing how readily hemoglobin acquires and binds oxygen in the lungs and releases oxygen into the tissues is the oxygen equilibrium curve, or OEC. The OEC represents the proportion of oxyhemoglobin, measured as the percentage of oxygen saturation (O2 % saturation) on the vertical axis relative to the amount of oxygen dissolved in blood, indicated as the oxygen tension, or partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), on the horizontal axis.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have demonstrated in preclinical models that our novel hemoglobin modifiers, including Oxbryta, bind to hemoglobin, resulting in increased oxygen affinity. The effect of Oxbryta on the measured OEC is a shift of the curve to the left. In other words, at a given prevailing oxygen tension in the blood, we have observed a higher percentage of oxygen saturation, or a higher proportion of oxyhemoglobin in the blood, following the administration of Oxbryta.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn several preclinical studies of SCD, scientists have demonstrated that hemoglobin in the oxygenated state is a potent inhibitor of HbS polymerization. Since HbS polymerization occurs in the deoxygenated state, we believe that increasing the proportion of oxyhemoglobin, or \u201cleft-shifting\u201d the OEC, should delay the polymerization of HbS and prevent the sickling of RBCs, which may ameliorate many of the clinical manifestations of SCD. Importantly, we are able to measure the proportion of hemoglobin modification (%HbMOD), which is expressed as the percentage of hemoglobin molecules occupied or bound by Oxbryta.\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nHbF, which is present during fetal development and persists for up to six to nine months in infants until it is replaced by adult hemoglobin, has an inherent high affinity for oxygen, which is critical for a developing fetus to capture oxygen from the mother\u2019s blood. Newborns with SCD do not experience RBC sickling until approximately six to nine months of age, after which HbF is no longer expressed. Additionally, it has been observed that rare individuals who have inherited the HbS mutation and a gene modification that allows them to continue to express 10% to 30% HbF in their RBCs into adulthood do not exhibit the clinical manifestations of SCD, despite expressing up to 90% HbS in their blood. HbF dilutes the concentration of deoxygenated HbS that can participate in polymerization, and, thereby, prevents hemoglobin polymer from forming.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBased on these observations, during our development of Oxbryta we posited that to delay polymerization of HbS, Oxbryta would need to bind to only approximately 10% to 30% of the total hemoglobin in a patient\u2019s blood. One theoretical concern regarding increasing the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen is that excessive oxygen affinity could prevent hemoglobin from releasing oxygen into the tissues, thus causing hypoxia. However, we have not observed any findings from our clinical programs that demonstrated any evidence of such tissue impairment. Based on HbF data, our animal toxicology studies, and our clinical studies, we believe we have demonstrated that our target modification of the total hemoglobin in a patient\u2019s blood does not adversely compromise oxygen delivery to the tissues. This is supported by exercise testing we have performed in SCD patients and healthy volunteers showing normal oxygen consumption and the absence of a dose level or exposure related increase in erythropoietin levels in patients enrolled in the HOPE Study.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOxbryta increases hemoglobin\u2019s affinity for oxygen by binding to the alpha-chain of hemoglobin. Oxbryta has been demonstrated to keep a proportion of HbS in its oxygenated state so it cannot participate in polymerization. Similar to HbF, by diluting total HbS with a proportion of Oxbryta-bound hemoglobin, Oxbryta prevents hemoglobin polymer formation. Based on its mechanism of action, we believe that Oxbryta can reduce the physical and clinical manifestations of SCD.\n \n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOverview of Phase 3 and Other Oxbryta Clinical Trials\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPhase 3 HOPE Study\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-national Phase 3 clinical trial of Oxbryta in adult and adolescent patients with SCD that we refer to as the HOPE (Hemoglobin Oxygen Affinity Modulation to Inhibit HbS PolymErization) Study, the interim results of which we used as the basis for our accelerated approval under Subpart H of FDA\u2019s NDA regulations. Data from the Phase 3 HOPE Study of 274 patients 12 years of age and older with SCD showed that the HOPE Study met its primary endpoint of an improvement in hemoglobin greater than 1 g/dL at 24 weeks with Oxbryta 1500 mg compared with placebo: After 24 weeks of treatment, 51.1% of patients receiving Oxbryta achieved a greater than 1 g/dL increase in hemoglobin compared with 6.5% receiving placebo (p<0.001). In addition, the data demonstrated corresponding improvements in other markers of hemolysis as well as a favorable safety and tolerability profile for Oxbryta. These interim Phase 3 HOPE Study data were published in the June 2019 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn connection with the accelerated approval of Oxbryta, we submitted the final study report for the Phase 3 HOPE Study to the FDA in September 2020. This report included completed long-term results from the Phase 3 HOPE Study, which demonstrated that Oxbryta at 1500 mg resulted in durable improvements in hemoglobin levels and markers of hemolysis up to 72 weeks of treatment. As shown in the following graph, a large majority of patients (approximately 90%) achieved a Hb improvement of >1 g/dL from baseline at one or more time points during the study as compared to placebo (approximately 25%). The study also found significant improvements in markers of hemolysis in indirect bilirubin and reticulocyte percentage. Consistent with the 24-week data, treatment with Oxbryta remained well tolerated. The most common side effects reported were headache, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, arthralgia, rash and pyrexia. The final Phase 3 HOPE Study data were published in the May 2021 issue of \nThe Lancet Haematology\n.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHb, hemoglobin\n \n\n\nSource: Long-Term Efficacy and Safety of Voxelotor in Adolescents and Adults with Sickle Cell Disease: HOPE Trial 72-Week Analysis, ASH 2020 Poster #1716\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs presented at the ASH Annual Meeting & Exposition in December 2020, the annualized incidence rates of VOCs were numerically lower in patients receiving Oxbryta 1500 mg (2.4) than placebo (2.8); and this numerical difference was greater in patients who had experienced two or more VOCs in the year prior to the study. In addition, a post-hoc analysis of the long-term results from the Phase 3 HOPE Study found that higher hemoglobin levels achieved with Oxbryta were associated with a lower incidence of VOCs over 72 weeks. Patients with the highest average hemoglobin levels over 72 weeks experienced the fewest VOCs with Oxbryta, with a stepwise reduction in VOC rate as hemoglobin levels increased. While the Phase 3 HOPE Study was not designed or powered to show an effect on VOCs, these results suggest the importance of reducing hemolysis and raising hemoglobin in individuals with SCD through inhibition of polymerization.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAnother analysis of the long-term results from the Phase 3 HOPE Study used the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) scale, a validated outcomes measure that provides a holistic assessment of the effect of treatment. Results showed that treatment with Oxbryta compared to placebo resulted in a statistically significant higher rating of improved overall patient health status after 72 weeks by the treating physician.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs part of the accelerated approval for Oxbryta, we agreed with the FDA to complete at least five years of follow-up for all patients on treatment and submit to the FDA interim reports each year in June from 2021 to 2025. We reported the first results from this open-label extension (OLE) of the HOPE Study at the ASH Annual Meeting & Exposition in December 2021. As shown in the following graph, these data confirmed the durable efficacy of long-term Oxbryta use in SCD patients ages 12 and older as demonstrated by the sustained improvements in hemoglobin and markers of hemolysis during the OLE for patients who previously received 900 mg and 1,500 mg of Oxbryta. In addition, patients who switched from placebo to Oxbryta saw improvements in hemoglobin levels and measures of hemolysis from the start of the OLE through week 120, consistent with the Phase 3 HOPE Study results. Safety data from the HOPE Study OLE were consistent with those from the Phase 3 HOPE Study of SCD patients ages 12 years and older.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nReal-World Use Studies\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nData and analyses from real-world experience with Oxbryta were presented at medical meetings in 2020 and 2021, including most recently at the ASH Annual Meeting & Exposition in December 2021. Highlights from these medical meeting presentations include:\n \n\n\n\u2022\nAn analysis evaluating Symphony Health claims data from a subset of 3,128 SCD patients ages 12 and older treated with Oxbryta, which showed statistically significant reductions in transfusions, VOCs and hospitalizations in patients treated with Oxbryta. \n\n\n\u2022\nAn analysis of real-world outcomes in 77 patients with SCD treated in a single-center case series showed that hemoglobin levels increased by an average of 2 g/dL after treatment with Oxbryta along with corresponding improvements in markers of hemolysis. A hemoglobin response greater than 1 g/dL with Oxbryta was observed in 62% of patients without the use of hydroxyurea and 87% of patients treated with hydroxyurea and Oxbryta. The robust hematologic response was associated with improved clinical status, as measured by the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) scales, validated outcomes measures that provide holistic assessments of the effect of treatment by the physicians and patients, respectively. Few adverse events were recorded, and all were resolved with dose modification. The safety profile observed in this analysis was consistent with the approved label for Oxbryta.\n \n\n\n\u2022\nIn the second quarter of 2021, we initiated the RETRO and PROSPECT data registries to enable deeper understanding of Oxbryta\u2019s long-term efficacy and safety. Initial results from the RETRO study showed Oxbryta treatment was associated with increased hemoglobin levels and decreased hemolytic markers; safety data was consistent with the Phase 3 HOPE Study of SCD patients ages 12 years and older. Final results from the RETRO study and initial results from the PROSPECT study are anticipated in 2022.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdditional Studies\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are conducting and plan to conduct additional clinical trials of Oxbryta, including our Phase 2a HOPE-KIDS 1 Study, our Phase 3 HOPE-KIDS 2 Study, our ActIVe Study and studies focused on sleep quality, blood flow within the brain, neurocognitive functions and leg ulcer healing. The HOPE-KIDS 1 Study, the HOPE-KIDS 2 Study and other aspects of our overall clinical development program for Oxbryta are also intended to position us to be able to seek approval over time for product labeling for Oxbryta for patients younger than the current age limit (4 years old), down to as young as 9 months of age.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPhase 2a HOPE-KIDS 1 Study\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are continuing to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of Oxbryta in adolescent and pediatric patients with SCD in an ongoing Phase 2a clinical trial, which we call the HOPE-KIDS 1 Study. Initiated in August 2016, our ongoing HOPE-KIDS 1 Study is an open-label, single- and multiple-dose Phase 2a study that is evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and exploratory treatment effect of Oxbryta in pediatric patients aged 4 to 17 years with SCD. Part A of the study evaluated a single 600 mg dose of Oxbryta in 13 patients aged 6 to 17 years, while Part B was designed to explore Oxbryta at doses of 900 mg and 1500 mg per day administered to 40 patients ages 12 to 17 for 24 weeks. Part C of the study is evaluating Oxbryta at a single 1500 mg dose (or weight-based equivalent) in patients age 4 to 17 years for up to 48 weeks, and Part D of the study is evaluating the safety of Oxbryta at the weight based equivalent of 1500 mg in patients age 6 months to under 4 years as measured by Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, or TEAEs, and Serious Adverse Events, or SAEs.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPart A pharmacokinetics, or PK, data in adolescents (12 to 17 years) demonstrated that the PK and half-life of Oxbryta were similar in adolescents and adults with results supporting once-daily dosing. Part A data for pediatric patients (6 to 11 years) demonstrated that PK exposures were higher in children compared with adolescents and adults, which informed dose selection for future pediatric studies in children under 12 years of age.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe primary objective of Part B was to assess the effect of Oxbryta on anemia. Secondary objectives include effect on clinical measures of hemolysis and PK profile. Additionally, we were able to assess the exploratory endpoint of TCD flow velocity measures in this study as TCD is a measure of stroke risk in pediatric and adolescent SCD patients. TCD measurement was not a primary or secondary endpoint or eligibility criteria in the HOPE KIDS-1 Study. Part B demonstrated a hematologic response to Oxbryta therapy, as evidenced by improvements in one or more markers of hemolysis and anemia (hemoglobin, unconjugated bilirubin and percentage reticulocyte counts).\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe primary objective of Part C is to assess change in cerebral blood flow as measured by TCD flow velocity, and it has completed enrollment with patients age 4 to 17 years. Secondary measures of Part C include effect on clinical measures of hemolysis, change in cerebral blood flow and PK profile. An interim analysis of data from 45 children with SCD ages 4 to 11 years enrolled in Part C showed that treatment with Oxbryta (1,500 mg or weight-based equivalent dispersed in a pediatric-appropriate formulation) resulted in rapid and sustained improvements in hemoglobin. An increase in hemoglobin of greater than 1 g/dL from baseline was observed in 47% of patients as early as two weeks and sustained through 24 weeks, consistent with results in patients ages 12 years and older in the Phase 3 HOPE Study. Concurrent improvements in markers of hemolysis were also observed.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPart D began enrolling patients age 6 months to under 4 years in 2020, and will assess, as its primary endpoint, the safety of a weight based equivalent of 1500 mg. Secondary measures include effect on clinical measures of hemolysis and PK profile.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPhase 3 HOPE-KIDS 2 Study\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs a condition of accelerated approval of Oxbryta in the United States, and to potentially obtain full regulatory approval for Oxbryta, we will continue to study Oxbryta in the HOPE-KIDS 2 Study, a post-approval confirmatory study we initiated in December 2019 that is using TCD flow velocity to seek to demonstrate a decrease in stroke risk in children 2 to 15 years of age. HOPE-KIDS 2 is a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial that will enroll approximately 220 patients with conditional TCD flow velocity (170-199 cm/sec) at about 50 sites in the United States, Europe and Africa. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of Oxbryta on reducing the risk of stroke in children with SCD at 24 weeks months using mean change in TCD levels. Key secondary measures include conversion to normal or abnormal TCD at 96 weeks, change in hemoglobin over time and effect on clinical measures of hemolysis.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHOPE-KIDS 2 trial activities are ongoing and screening and enrollment of participants has begun in the United States, as well as various countries in Africa and in the Middle East and North Africa region. The overall treatment period will be 96 weeks, and, in connection with the accelerated approval of Oxbryta, we have agreed with the FDA to submit the interim study report by July 2025, complete the trial by March 2026 and to submit the final study report by September 2026.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nActIVe Study\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nOur ongoing Phase 4 ActIVe (Actigraphy Improvement with Voxelotor) Study, an open-label, single-arm study, aims to evaluate daily physical activity and sleep quality in SCD patients 12 to 55 years of age who are on Oxbryta therapy.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSales and Marketing\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur commercial footprint includes a field force of approximately 100 customer-facing personnel. This includes our sales resources, payer account management and patient and distribution support. In addition, our infrastructure includes home office based commercial marketing, patient support and distribution teams. The launch of Oxbryta has continued throughout the pandemic and, until recently, has been solely focused on patients who are 12 years of age and older. Our commercial efforts have been geographically targeted in the 17 states where approximately 80% of the SCD patients reside in the United States. Our commercial footprint allows us to call on the key SCD healthcare providers and centers in the United States, including hematologists, pediatric hematologists and primary care physicians who see SCD patients.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWith the recent expansion of Oxbryta\u2019s label to include children ages 4 to less than 12 years, we are actively launching this product line extension. We are continuing to call on the majority of the SCD pediatric HCPs, many of whom have experience with Oxbryta in their pediatric patients ages 12 and older, which we believe will lead to a more efficient launch. In addition, we have added some additional HCPs to our target list upon approval of the expanded label to ensure education will occur across the majority of pediatric specialists.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are also providing a comprehensive patient support program, called GBT Source Solutions, to support our commercialization in the United States. This high-touch support program helps patients through the entire process by (i) reviewing insurance coverage options and explaining benefits; (ii) working with the specialty pharmacy partner network to coordinate delivery of Oxbryta to wherever the patient chooses; (iii) helping with financial and copay assistance for eligible patients; and (iv) helping patients stay on treatment as prescribed by their treating physicians with a nurse support team.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWith respect to commercializing Oxbryta outside of the United States, we have established in Europe strategically located subsidiaries and are building a small team and additional capabilities that may be necessary to effectively support such potential commercialization, subject to any required approval. With the recent approval of Oxbryta in the EU (and our recent application with the MHRA for a potential Great Britain Marketing Authorisation), we are currently focusing these capabilities on a limited number of core European markets that have the largest numbers of SCD patients, where we expect to launch Oxbryta with a small internal sales force. Where appropriate, we may also utilize strategic partners, distributors or contract sales forces to expand the commercial availability of Oxbryta. For example, we have established a distribution agreement with Biopharma-MEA for the distribution of Oxbryta in the GCC region.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe currently do not expect that we will require large pharmaceutical partners for the commercialization of Oxbryta or our product candidates, although we may consider partnering in certain territories for certain New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, or indications for other strategic purposes. We regularly evaluate our commercialization strategy as we advance our programs.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nCompetition\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. There are many public and private biopharmaceutical companies, universities, governmental agencies and other research organizations actively engaged in the research and development of products that may be similar to our product candidates or address similar markets. In addition, the number of companies seeking to develop and commercialize products and therapies similar to Oxbryta and our product candidates is likely to increase.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWith respect to Oxbryta, inclacumab and GBT601, we face competition from the three currently FDA-approved treatments: hydroxyurea (marketed under several brand names, including Siklos\n\u00ae\n by Medunik USA, Inc., and Droxia\n\u00ae\n by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, as well as in generic form), approved to reduce the frequency of painful crises and need for blood transfusions in patients with sickle cell anemia for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients age two years and older with SCD; Endari\n\u00ae\n (marketed by Emmaus Medical, Inc.), approved to reduce acute complications of SCD in patients age five years and older; and Adakveo (marketed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation), approved to reduce the frequency of VOCs in adult and pediatric patients age 16 years and older with SCD. Multiple companies are developing product candidates for chronic treatment in SCD, and several other companies are in early clinical trials to investigate new mechanisms of action for the chronic treatment of SCD. For example, Forma Therapeutics Holdings, LLC, with etavopivat, and Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. with mitapivat, are separately evaluating pyruvate kinase-R, or PKR, activators in clinical development for the potential treatment of SCD. Another example is Fulcrum Therapeutics, Inc., with FTX-6058, an oral fetal hemoglobin (HbF) inducer, in clinical development in SCD patients. We may also face competition from one-time therapies for patients with severe SCD, including hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, gene therapy and gene editing. For example, bluebird bio, Inc., is currently engaged in the clinical development of lovo-cel, which aims to treat SCD by inserting a functional human beta-globin gene into the patient\u2019s own hematopoietic stem cells, or HSCs, ex vivo and then transplanting the modified stem cells into the patient\u2019s bloodstream. Bluebird has indicated its plans to pursue an accelerated development and approval pathway for its gene therapy product in SCD. In addition, gene editing, which is the process of altering specific sequences of genomic DNA, is being investigated by multiple companies for the potential treatment of SCD. For example, CRISPR Therapeutics AG and Vertex\n \n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., are currently engaged in the clinical co-development of CTX001 for the potential treatment of SCD, under a collaboration focused on the use of CRISPR\u2019s CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology to discover and develop potential new treatments aimed at the underlying genetic causes of human disease. In addition, several agents are in development for the treatment of VOC in patients with SCD.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSome of our potential competitors, alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and the commercialization of those treatments. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRegulatory Path for Oxbryta in International Markets\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn February 2022, the EC granted marketing authorization for Oxbryta for the treatment of hemolytic anemia due to SCD in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older as monotherapy or in combination with hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea), and such authorization includes all Member States of the EU as well as the additional Member States of the European Economic Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). Prior to such EC approval, the CHMP adopted a positive opinion recommending marketing authorization for Oxbryta.\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nNow that the UK (which includes Great Britain and Northern Ireland) has exited the EU, often referred to as Brexit, Great Britain will no longer be covered by centralized MAs granted by the EC, and Great Britain is, therefore, not covered by the centralized marketing authorization issued by the EC for Oxbryta (while, under the Northern Ireland Protocol, centralized MAs will continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). As such, potential regulatory approval of Oxbryta in Great Britain will now require an application to the UK medicines regulator, the MHRA. For a period of two years from January 1, 2021, the MHRA may rely on a decision taken by the EC to grant an MA under the Centralized Procedure to potentially more quickly grant a new Great Britain MA. Following the positive opinion from the CHMP, recommending the approval of Oxbryta in the EU, we submitted an application to the MHRA for a Great Britain MA using such EC Decision Reliance Procedure.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPrior to filing our MAA, in November 2016, the EC granted Orphan Drug Designation status in the EU for Oxbryta for the treatment of SCD, and, in June 2017, the EMA granted PRIME designation for Oxbryta for the treatment of SCD. The PRIME scheme is a regulatory mechanism that provides for early and proactive EMA support to medicine developers to help patients benefit as early as possible from innovative new products that have demonstrated the potential to significantly address an unmet medical need, and in January 2022, the MHRA awarded Oxbryta a positive scientific opinion under the EAMS. In addition, we have initiated an early access program in Europe for patients and physicians who may need access to Oxbryta prior to potential marketing authorization.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn September 2020, we entered into an exclusive agreement with Biopharma-MEA to distribute Oxbryta in the GCC region. Biopharm-MEA is responsible for registering Oxbryta with the relevant regulatory authorities in each of the countries to potentially make it broadly available. While this process is ongoing, the U.S. approval of Oxbryta can be referenced to allow for access to the medicine in the GCC region while regulatory authorities conduct their reviews.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManufacturing\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are commercializing solid oral formulations of Oxbryta in a tablet form and a new tablet for oral suspension form , recently approved by the FDA. We believe we have obtained an adequate supply of both formulations to satisfy our immediate commercial, clinical and nonclinical demands.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWith respect to manufacturing, we do not own or operate or have any plans to establish any manufacturing facilities. We currently depend on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for all of our requirements of raw materials, drug substance and drug product for our commercial, clinical and nonclinical activities for our portfolio, and we have entered into commercial manufacturing agreements with some of our CMOs to support Oxbryta commercialization. We intend to continue to rely on CMOs for the commercialization as well as continued development of Oxbryta, as well as the development and commercialization of any other product candidates, including inclacumab and GBT601. Although we rely on CMOs, we have personnel and third-party consultants with extensive manufacturing experience to oversee the relationships with our contract manufacturers.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo decrease the risk of an interruption to our drug supply, when we believe it is reasonable for us to do so, we source materials from multiple suppliers so that, in general, the loss of any one source of supply should not have a material adverse effect on commercial production, project timelines or inventory of supplies for our studies or clinical trials. For example, we have established a\n \n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nsecond source for commercial drug substance and a second source for finished drug product for Oxbryta commercial supply. However, currently we have only one or a limited number of suppliers for some of these materials for Oxbryta and for other programs, and the loss of a primary source of supply could potentially delay the availability of Oxbryta or delay our development programs. We maintain a safety stock of certain materials to help avoid delays in production, but we do not know whether such stock will be sufficient. There is no guarantee as to if or when we may establish the additional sources or whether they will be adequate in all circumstances we may encounter.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDrug Discovery and Development\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur goal is to build a robust product pipeline focused on the discovery and development of novel therapeutic approaches for SCD and grievous blood disorders. Our research and development pipeline targets multiple pathologies, including vascular occlusion and hemoglobin polymerization, and our most advanced development programs are for inclacumab and GBT601.\n \n\n\nWe have an active business development strategy that may provide new opportunities to expand our product pipeline with next-generation treatments for SCD. To this end, we have entered into agreements with Roche, Syros and Sanofi S.A.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLicense Agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn August 2018, we entered into the License Agreement, or Roche Agreement, with Roche pursuant to which Roche granted us an exclusive and sublicensable worldwide license under certain patent rights and know-how to develop and commercialize inclacumab, including any modified compounds targeting P-selectin and derived from inclacumab, for all indications and uses, except diagnostic use. Roche retained a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free license to inclacumab solely for any diagnostic use.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are developing inclacumab as a treatment for VOCs in patients with SCD, and we expect to be able to leverage the safety data from Roche\u2019s prior clinical studies, which were not in patients with SCD, as we proceed with our development of inclacumab. We have initiated two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials of inclacumab. One study is designed to measure the reduction in frequency of VOCs over one year in patients with SCD when treated with inclacumab (30 mg/kg) or placebo every 12 weeks. The second study will evaluate inclacumab based on a primary endpoint of 90-day hospital readmission rates for VOC following an initial VOC hospitalization. Participants in that trial will receive either a single dose of inclacumab (30 mg/kg) or placebo, peri-discharge following a VOC hospitalization.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnder the Roche Agreement, we have paid Roche an upfront payment of $2.0 million and a total of $7.3 million in clinical development milestone payments. Under such agreement, we are obligated to pay Roche up to an aggregate of $125.5 million in milestone payments for the SCD indication, including up to $40.5 million based on achievement of certain clinical development and regulatory milestones for inclacumab in the SCD indication and up to $85.0 million based on achievement of certain thresholds for annual net sales of inclacumab. In addition, we are obligated under such agreement to pay Roche up to an aggregate of $6.4 million in milestone payments that are owed to third parties based on achievement of such clinical development and regulatory milestones for inclacumab. We will also pay Roche up to $19.25 million in milestone payments based on achievement of certain clinical development and regulatory milestones for inclacumab for any other indication than the SCD indication. We have the right to sublicense our rights under the Roche Agreement to our affiliates without Roche\u2019s consent. Subject to certain conditions and limitations, including Roche\u2019s right of first negotiation described below, we will also have the right to sublicense our rights under the Roche Agreement to non-affiliates pursuant to partner agreements with Roche\u2019s prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If at any time prior to the expiration of royalty or other payment obligations under the Roche Agreement, or the earlier termination of the Roche Agreement, we intend to enter into a partner agreement to sublicense rights to inclacumab, then Roche will have a right of first negotiation during an exclusivity period to negotiate in good faith with us the terms and conditions of such proposed transaction.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCollaboration with Syros Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn December 2019, we entered into the Syros Agreement to discover, develop and commercialize novel therapies for SCD and beta thalassemia. Under the agreement, Syros will use its leading gene control platform to identify therapeutic targets and discover small molecule drugs that potentially induce fetal hemoglobin, and we have an option to obtain an exclusive worldwide license, with the right to sublicense, under relevant intellectual property rights and know-how of Syros arising from the collaboration, to develop, manufacture and commercialize any compounds or products resulting from the collaboration, subject to Syros\u2019 option to co-promote the first product in the United States. If we exercise the option, we will be responsible for all development, manufacture, regulatory activities and commercialization of the compound or product. Syros and we will be responsible for our own costs incurred to conduct research activities, except that we will fund up to a total of $40.0 million in preclinical research for at least three years. Unless earlier terminated or extended, the research program under the agreement will end on the third anniversary of the agreement.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnder the Syros Agreement, we paid Syros an upfront payment of $20.0 million, and, if we exercise the option, we may be obligated to pay Syros up to $315.0 million in option exercise, development, regulatory, commercialization and sales-based milestones per product candidate and product resulting from the collaboration. We will also be obligated to pay Syros, subject to certain reductions, tiered mid- to high-single digit royalties as percentages of calendar year net sales on any product resulting from the collaboration.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLicense Agreement with Sanofi S.A.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn March 2021, we entered into the Sanofi Agreement, pursuant to which Sanofi granted us an exclusive and sublicensable license under certain patent rights and know-how controlled by Sanofi to use, develop, manufacture, commercialize and otherwise exploit certain compounds, including compounds directed against or that modulate one of two specified targets and any product containing a licensed compound for the diagnosis, prevention and/or treatment of human diseases worldwide. Sanofi retains rights to use its know-how to conduct non-clinical development of, and to manufacture, compounds other than the licensed compounds or licensed products under the Sanofi Agreement.\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nUnder the Sanofi Agreement, we paid to Sanofi an upfront payment of $2.25 million and have agreed to pay up to an aggregate of $351.0 million in milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, commercial and sales-based milestones relating to the licensed products. We also agreed to pay Sanofi royalties in the low single-digit to mid-single-digit percentages of annual net sales of licensed products, which are payable on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis commencing on the first commercial sale of a licensed product in such country and continuing until the latest of (i) ten years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country, (ii) the expiration of the last valid claim under the licensed patent rights or certain derived patent rights that cover such licensed product in such country, and (iii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such licensed product in such country. The royalty rate is subject to reduction under certain circumstances.\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are solely responsible, at our own expense, for all development, manufacturing, regulatory activities and commercialization of the licensed products worldwide. Under the Sanofi Agreement, we have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize one or more licensed products in certain territories.\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Sanofi Agreement will expire on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis on the date of the expiration of all applicable royalty terms, unless earlier terminated. Upon expiration of the Sanofi Agreement with respect to a licensed product and country, our license with respect to the applicable licensed product in the applicable country will become a fully paid-up, perpetual and irrevocable license. Either party may terminate the Sanofi Agreement for the other party\u2019s material breach following a cure period or upon certain insolvency events. We may terminate the Sanofi Agreement, for any or no reason, upon 90 days\u2019 prior written notice to Sanofi, and Sanofi may terminate the Sanofi Agreement in the event we challenge the validity or enforceability of Sanofi\u2019s patent rights. Upon any termination of the Sanofi Agreement before its expiration, all rights and licenses granted by Sanofi to us under the Sanofi Agreement or with respect to the specific terminated licensed product, as applicable, will terminate and revert to Sanofi.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSocial, Governance, Human Capital and Environment\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSocial\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are committed to addressing longstanding disparities in care faced by the SCD community and fighting injustice within the healthcare system and beyond. In March 2021, we established the GBT Social Empowerment Council, a group of independent advisors, including minority activists, physicians, public health experts and civic leaders, to provide diverse perspectives and counsel on how we can apply our expertise and resources going forward to positively impact the SCD community and the communities where we live and work. In September 2021, we established The GBT Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, primarily funded by our company. The GBT Foundation seeks to improve the health and well-being of underserved communities around the world, particularly for people living with SCD, and will fund organizations focused on health, gender and racial equity through education, empowerment, and innovation for people living with serious disorders.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDiversity & Inclusion\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSince our founding, we have recognized that having a more diverse, equitable and inclusive environment can help us to better deliver for patients through increased performance, better decision making, increased productivity, and greater motivation. Our belief is that to foster innovation, increase access and reduce disparities, our workforce needs to be reflective of the patients and communities we serve and to be compensated in line with the value brought to patients, caregivers and communities. Beginning with our proxy statement filing in 2021, we began to release annual workforce data as part of our commitment to transparency, and these data have shown that our team represents a broad range of cultural and professional backgrounds, which we believe enrich our culture\n \n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nand will drive our future growth and success. In 2021 and 2022, we were included in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index, which includes public companies committed to disclosing their efforts to support gender equality through policy development, representation and transparency. In 2022, the index included 418 companies, including only 23 in healthcare.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are committed to fostering workplace development, diversity, and inclusion, or WDDI, at our company and across the biotechnology industry and have adopted the WDDI Principles created by the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO). We are dedicated to being at the forefront of efforts to develop a diverse and talented global workforce. We pledge to do our part to foster diversity and inclusion among our employees, customers and patients.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHuman Capital Resources\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we employed 457 full-time employees globally, including 153 in research and development and 304 in selling, general and administrative, which includes our commercial team. We have and expect to continue to retain consultants from time to time if required in connection with our business.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe consider our employees to be an essential factor in our ability to serve our customers and achieve our goal to transform the treatment of SCD, which depends on our ability to continue to attract, hire, and retain qualified personnel. We believe our employee turnover has historically been relatively low and below the average for life science companies, but with our recent headcount growth and evolution into a commercial-stage company, as well as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced an increase in the number of employees leaving the company. Given our financial resources and our track record, we continue to be able to fill the vacated positions and grow our headcount in support of our mission.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo help attract, hire and retain skilled personnel, we offer a stimulating work environment, regular performance feedback, development opportunities, potential for career advancement, and a workplace culture focused on our mission and the wellbeing of our employees. We provide learning and development opportunities to grow leadership and management capability and career growth for all employees, provide technical and functional training and support diversity and inclusion goals. In addition, we also monitor and periodically adjust our compensation programs with the goal of providing a competitive mix of compensation (including salary, incentive bonus and equity) and benefits packages. Beginning in 2020, we confirmed through an annual independent assessment that there is no evidence of significant discrepancies in our overall pay practices based on gender and ethnicity.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees is represented by a labor organization or under any collective-bargaining arrangements. We consider our employee relations to be good.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEnvironment and Climate Change\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe seek to build a sustainable, vibrant company to develop medicines with optimized efficacy and safety for patients globally. We recognize that the sustainability of our company is linked to our ability to understand and engage all our stakeholders in a consistent and in meaningful manner. Starting with our Board of Directors and our leadership team, we are committed to long-term value driven by the pillars of governance, social responsibility, and integrity across all we do, including employee engagement, research and development, operations, commercialization and access to medicines for patients. Our efforts to help preserve the environment and reduce our impact on climate change include, among other things, moving to our new headquarters location with LEED Silver certification; utilizing technology to reduce energy and water consumption; reducing, recycling and reusing our resources when practicable; promoting employee commuting programs; and partnering with third-party organizations for the ethical treatment of animals in research.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIntellectual Property\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents and patent applications intended to cover Oxbryta and our product candidates and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, and any other aspects of inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe plan to continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio. We endeavor to promptly file domestic and international patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions, including applications directed to compositions and methods of treatment created or identified from our ongoing development of our product candidates. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary rights protecting our commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our current and future issued patents, if any, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on\n \n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nknow-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our intellectual property portfolio.\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nThe patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent, if any, is issued, and patent scope can be reinterpreted by the courts after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any patents, if issued, will provide sufficient protection from competitors for our business.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBecause patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially even longer, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings or derivation proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine the priority of inventions.\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nPatents\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur patent portfolio includes multiple issued U.S. and foreign patents, as well as multiple U.S. and foreign patent applications in various stages of prosecution or allowance. Our primary patents and patent applications relate to our general HbS intellectual property portfolio, which includes Oxbryta and its analogs.\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nOur HbS intellectual property portfolio is comprised of multiple patent families of patents and patent applications relating to Oxbryta and/or analogs that inhibit Hb polymerization. These patent families include patents and patent applications specifically related to Oxbryta, covering certain compositions of matter, methods of use, method of manufacture, commercial formulations, and polymorphs of Oxbryta and analogs. The pending patent applications are in a variety of jurisdictions, including the United States, jurisdictions under the Patent Cooperation Treaty and other countries.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWith regard to Oxbryta specifically, we are the sole owner of issued U.S. patents covering Oxbryta, including its composition of matter, methods of use, formulations and polymorphs of Oxbryta. These issued U.S. patents covering Oxbryta are listed in the FDA Orange Book and will expire between 2032 and 2037, absent any applicable patent term extensions. Also with regard to Oxbryta specifically, we are the sole owner of issued composition of matter patents in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions. Any patents that may issue from our pending patent applications relating to Oxbryta in the United States or from corresponding foreign patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire between 2032 and 2037, absent any applicable patent term extensions. Some of these pending patent applications are jointly owned by us and Regents of the University of California, or the Regents, as described below.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur other patents in our HbS intellectual property portfolio are comprised of additional issued U.S. patents covering Oxbryta analogs. These patents, and any patents that may issue from our pending patent applications relating to Oxbryta analogs in the United States or from corresponding foreign patent applications, if issued, are currently expected to expire between 2032 and 2039, absent any applicable patent term extensions. Some of these pending patent applications are jointly owned by us and the Regents, as described below.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor those patents and pending applications jointly owned by us and the Regents, we have exclusively licensed from the Regents worldwide patent rights covering Oxbryta and certain Oxbryta analogs, some of which patent rights we jointly own with the Regents. In exchange for our exclusive license, we have agreed to pay a royalty to the Regents of less than 1% on future net sales and to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture, market and sell the products covered by the licensed patents. The risks associated with joint ownership of patent rights are more fully discussed under \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWith regard to GBT601 specifically, we are the sole owner of an issued U.S. patent covering its composition of matter, which will expire in 2039, absent any applicable patent term extensions, and we are also the sole owner of an issued composition of matter patent in Europe as well as pending applications in the same patent family in other foreign jurisdictions. The European patent, as well as any other foreign patents that issue from this same patent family, will expire in 2039, absent any applicable patent term extensions.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWith regard to inclacumab, we are the exclusive worldwide licensee of Roche\u2019s patent portfolio relating to inclacumab, which includes issued U.S. and foreign patents and pending applications covering the composition of matter of inclacumab. We expect inclacumab, if approved, to be eligible for regulatory exclusivity (e.g., data exclusivity for biologics and orphan drug exclusivity) in various jurisdictions such as the U.S. and Europe, which exclusivities are likely to extend beyond patent expiry.\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBeyond our HbS and inclacumab intellectual property portfolios, we own other issued U.S. and foreign patents, seek to obtain additional issued patents, and file patent applications relating to our other research and development programs over time. \n\u00a0\n\n\nPatent term\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nThe base term of a U.S. patent is 20 years from the filing date of the earliest-filed non-provisional patent application from which the patent claims priority, assuming that all maintenance fees are paid. The term of a U.S. patent can be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates the owner of the patent for administrative delays at the USPTO, the extent of which is offset by delays by the patent owner before the USPTO in obtaining the patent. In some cases, the term of a U.S. patent is shortened by a terminal disclaimer that reduces its term to that of an earlier-expiring patent. The term of a U.S. patent may be eligible for patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act, to account for at least some of the time the drug is under development and regulatory review after the patent is granted. With regard to a drug for which FDA approval is the first permitted marketing of the active ingredient, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows for extension of the term of one U.S. patent that includes at least one claim covering the composition of matter of an FDA-approved drug, an FDA-approved method of treatment using the drug and/or a method of manufacturing the FDA-approved drug. The extended patent term cannot exceed the shorter of five years beyond the non-extended expiration of the patent or 14 years from the date of the FDA approval of the drug. Some foreign jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan, have analogous patent term extension provisions, which allow for extension of the term of a patent that covers a drug approved by the applicable foreign regulatory agency. Following the FDA approval of Oxbryta, we applied for patent term extension on the Oxbryta composition-of-matter patent, and we would expect to apply for patent term extension for any other eligible product candidate that receives FDA approval in the future, as well as in other jurisdictions where patent term extension is available.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTrade secrets\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We typically rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We protect trade secrets and know-how by establishing confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of an individual\u2019s or entity\u2019s relationship with us must be kept confidential during and after the relationship. These agreements also typically provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, shall be our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGovernment Regulation\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGovernment authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products. Pricing of such products is also subject to regulation in many countries. Generally, before a new product can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nU.S. drug and biological product development\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and biological products under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, and their implementing regulations. Drugs and biological products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA\u2019s refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, withdrawal of an approval, revocation of a license, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, voluntary or mandatory product recalls, withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA or biologics license application, or BLA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following:\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\ncompletion of extensive nonclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA\u2019s GLP regulations; \n\n\n\u2022\nsubmission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; \n\n\n\u2022\napproval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated; \n\n\n\u2022\nperformance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practices, or GCPs, and other clinical-trial related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug or biological product for each proposed indication; \n\n\n\u2022\nsubmission to the FDA of an NDA for a new drug or a BLA for a biological product; \n\n\n\u2022\na determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA whether to accept it for filing and review; \n\n\n\u2022\nsatisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product\u2019s identity, strength, quality and purity; \n\n\n\u2022\npotential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and \n\n\n\u2022\nFDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product in the United States. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe nonclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for any of our product candidates, will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. The data required to support an NDA or BLA are generated in two distinct development stages: nonclinical and clinical. The nonclinical development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation and determining the manufacturing process, as well as carrying out non-human toxicology, pharmacology and drug metabolism studies in the laboratory, which support subsequent clinical testing in humans. As the product candidate sponsor, we must submit the results of the nonclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trial and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. The FDA also may place a clinical hold after a trial has begun. When a clinical hold has been placed, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin or resume. The FDA also may impose a partial clinical hold that would limit a trial, for example, to certain doses or for a certain length of time or to a certain number of subjects.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe clinical stage of development involves the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor\u2019s control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nClinical trials\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nClinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials, which may overlap.\n \n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nPhase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the product candidate. \n\n\n\u2022\nPhase 2 clinical trials typically involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose of the product candidate required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified, and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted. \n\n\n\u2022\n \n\n\n\u2022\nPhase 3 clinical trials generally involve large numbers of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product candidate for its intended use, its safety in use, and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product approval. Phase 3 clinical trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPost-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval, to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA. In addition, as part of an accelerated approval, such as we received for Oxbryta under the FDA\u2019s Subpart H regulations, at least one post-marketing study to verify clinical benefit is required.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs the product candidate sponsor, we must submit progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials and other information at least annually to the FDA, as well as written IND safety reports to the FDA and the study investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the product candidate and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor\u2019s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB\u2019s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must include methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA manufacturer of a product candidate for a serious disease or condition is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such product candidate. This requirement applies on the earlier of the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the product candidate or, as applicable, 15 days after the product candidate receives a designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product or regenerative advanced therapy.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNDA, BLA and FDA review process\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe results of nonclinical studies and clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the product candidate and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the drug or biological product for one or more specified indications. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine whether a drug is safe and effective for its intended use and a BLA to determine whether a biological product is safe, pure and potent for its intended use, along with whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP requirements to assure and preserve the product\u2019s identity, strength, quality and purity. FDA approval of an NDA or BLA must be obtained before a drug or biological product may be legally marketed in the United States.\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nUnder PDUFA, each NDA and BLA is typically accompanied by a user fee (adjusted on an annual basis). According to the FDA\u2019s fee schedule, effective through September 30, 2022, the user fee for an NDA or BLA is $3,117,218. PDUFA also imposes an annual prescription drug product program fee for human drugs and biological products ($369,413). Fee waivers or reductions are\n \n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\navailable in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business having fewer than 500 employees. Additionally, an application for a product that has been designated as a drug or biological product for a rare disease or condition (referred to as an orphan drug) under section 526 of the FDCA is not subject to an application fee unless the application includes an indication for other than a rare disease or condition. Oxbryta for the treatment of SCD has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA and by the EC.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA or BLA for filing. The FDA is supposed to make a decision on accepting an NDA or BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt of the submission. Once the NDA or BLA is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA or BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA is supposed to complete its initial review of an NDA or BLA that it has accepted for review and respond to the applicant within stated periods (within 10 months for a standard NDA or BLA and six months for an NDA or BLA designated by the agency for priority review). However, the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs and BLAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBefore approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product (including the facilities of contract manufacturers, if applicable) to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel product candidates or product candidates that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. There are likely to be extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. The review and evaluation of an NDA and BLA by the FDA is very comprehensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, under Subpart H of the FDA\u2019s NDA regulations, which governs accelerated approval, the FDA may approve an NDA for a new drug product on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. The corresponding accelerated approval provisions for biological products are in Subpart E of the FDA\u2019s biological product regulations. The FDA grants accelerated approval under Subpart H for new drugs that address serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments, and the NDA for Oxbryta was approved by the FDA under Subpart H. Drugs approved under Subpart H, such as Oxbryta, are required to be further evaluated in at least one post-marketing study to verify clinical benefit. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA may also impose marketing restrictions to limit distribution or use to assure safe use of the drug, although the FDA did not impose any such requirements for the accelerated approvals of Oxbryta tablets in 2019 or Oxbryta tablets for oral suspension in 2021. Pursuing accelerated approval under Subpart H does not ensure faster development timelines or ensure regulatory approval.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAfter the FDA evaluates an NDA or BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form, and usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA. The complete response letter may require additional clinical data and/or additional clinical trial(s), and/ or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, withdraw the application, or request a hearing. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnited States Orphan drug designation\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe were granted orphan drug designation by the FDA in 2015 for Oxbryta for the treatment of SCD. Under the Orphan Drug Act in the United States, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States (or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a product for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States of such product). Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, but does confer other potential development and commercialization benefits as described below.\n \n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur NDA seeking approval for Oxbryta for the treatment of SCD qualified for the orphan user fee exemption from the PDUFA application fee. In addition, we should qualify for additional incentives, including tax credits for qualifying clinical trials of Oxbryta, and Oxbryta also qualified for a substantial period of regulatory market exclusivity, which will expire in November 2026. If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or by providing a major contribution to patient care. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity. A competitor could also block the approval of one of our products for seven years by obtaining orphan product exclusivity for the same product (or a competitor product that contains our product candidate) for the same indication we are seeking. If a product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the EU has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nExpedited development and review programs\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition to the US orphan drug designation, Oxbryta received a Fast Track designation from the FDA for the potential treatment of SCD. The FDA\u2019s Fast Track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs or biological products that are intended to treat a serious or life threatening condition, where nonclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to both the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. For product candidates with Fast Track designation, sponsors may have more frequent interactions with the FDA. The FDA also may initiate review of sections of a product candidate\u2019s marketing application before the application is complete if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a product candidate with Fast Track designation may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA\u2019s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAny product candidate submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product candidate is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a product candidate designated for priority review. Our NDA for Oxbryta was reviewed by the FDA pursuant to priority review and received accelerated approval under Subpart H.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, Oxbryta also received a breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA for the potential treatment of SCD. Under the FDA\u2019s breakthrough therapy designation program, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biological products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as a Fast Track designation, in addition to intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPediatric information\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnder the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, as amended, an NDA or BLA, or supplement to an NDA or BLA, must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a product candidate that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration is required to submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no end-of-Phase 2 meeting as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to\n \n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nan agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. Generally, a product candidate that has an indication for which orphan drug designation has been granted is exempt from the requirement to contain an assessment of the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indication in pediatric patients. Thus, our NDA for Oxbryta was not required to have this PREA assessment.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPost-marketing requirements\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFollowing approval of a new product, a company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, submission of an NDA or BLA annual report, reporting of adverse experiences, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with complex promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or for patient populations for which the product was not approved (known as \u201coff-label use\u201d), and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and on interactions with healthcare providers. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with the first use of these materials, and may be required to be reviewed in advance in certain circumstances such as a new product launch, including for drugs such as Oxbryta that are approved pursuant to the FDA\u2019s Subpart H accelerated approval regulations. After 120 days following marketing approval, promotional materials for accelerated approval drugs must be submitted 30 days prior to use. Further, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the company may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or BLA, or NDA or BLA supplement, which may require additional data or the conduct of additional nonclinical studies and clinical trials. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product\u2019s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures, including a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, or the conduct of post-marketing studies to assess a newly discovered safety issue. The FDA has authority to require post-market studies, in certain circumstances, on reduced effectiveness of a product and the FDA may require labeling changes related to new reduced effectiveness information.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAny distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. The Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, was enacted in 2013 with the aim of building an electronic system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs, including biological products, distributed in the United States. The DSCSA mandates phased-in and resource-intensive obligations for manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers over a 10-year period that is expected to culminate in November 2023. The law\u2019s requirements include the quarantine and prompt investigation of a suspect product, to determine if it is illegitimate, and notifying trading partners and the FDA of any illegitimate product. Manufacturers and their collaborators are also required to place a unique product identifier on prescription drug packages. This identifier consists of the National Drug Code, serial number, lot number and expiration date, in the form of a two dimensional data matrix barcode that can be read by humans and machines.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP requirements. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP requirements. Our third party manufacturers must comply with cGMP requirements that require among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation, and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP requirements, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including recall.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOrange Book Listing\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSection 505 of the FDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA is an application in which the applicant, in part, relies on investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a\n \n\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\ngeneric drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product. Limited changes must be preapproved by the FDA via a suitability petition. ANDAs are termed \u201cabbreviated\u201d because they are generally not required to include nonclinical and clinical data to establish safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo, or other testing. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a subject\u2019s bloodstream in the same amount of time as the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents having claims that cover the applicant\u2019s product and method of use. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, also known as the Orange Book. These products may be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAny applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must make patent certifications to the FDA relating to patents submitted to the FDA for the reference product: (1) that no patent information on the reference drug or method of use that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) that any and all such patents submitted to the FDA have expired; (3) the date on which any such patent will expire and that ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA approval will not be sought until after such patent expiration; or (4) that any such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug product for which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA is submitted. The last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except where the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent through a paragraph IV certification or if the applicant is not seeking approval of a patented method of use. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or does not indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all of the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf the competitor has provided a paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the competitor must also send notice of the paragraph IV certification to the holder of the NDA for the reference listed drug and the patent owner within 20 days after the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA holder or patent owner may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a paragraph IV certification notice prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of 30 months from the date of the lawsuit, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn instances where an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant files a paragraph IV certification, the NDA holder or patent owners regularly take action to trigger the 30-month stay, recognizing that the related patent litigation may take many months or years to resolve. Thus, approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA could be delayed for a significant period of time depending on the patent certification the applicant makes and the reference drug sponsor\u2019s decision to initiate patent litigation.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWith respect to our approved NDA for the original formulation of Oxbryta tablets, we have listed nine patents in the Orange Book, and, with respect to our approved NDA for Oxbryta tablets for oral suspension, we have listed eight patents in the Orange Book.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nU.S. patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity and biosimilars in the United States and EU\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of Oxbryta and any of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension (also referred to as patent term restoration) under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term restoration of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product\u2019s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the patent term extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves any application for patent term extension. Following the FDA approval of Oxbryta, we applied for restoration of patent term for Oxbryta.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMarketing exclusivity provisions under the FDCA provide a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the\n \n\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator who holds the NDA for the active agent. The FDA has granted Oxbryta five-year marketing exclusivity, which will expire in November 2024.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA for a drug product that contains an active moiety that has been previously approved if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFive-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA by a competitor. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States which, if granted, adds six months to the end of existing exclusivity periods and patent terms, and may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued pre-approval written request for such a pediatric trial where information relating to the use of the product candidate in a pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, in the United States, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be \u201chighly similar\u201d or \u201cbiosimilar\u201d to or \u201cinterchangeable\u201d with an FDA approved biological product. This pathway allows competitors to reference the FDA\u2019s prior approvals regarding innovative biological products and data submitted with a BLA to obtain approval of a biosimilar application twelve years after the time of approval of the innovative biological product. The twelve-year exclusivity period runs from the initial approval of the innovator product and not from approval of a later new indication, if any. In addition, the twelve-year exclusivity period does not prevent another company from independently developing a product that is highly similar to the innovative product, generating all the data necessary for and seeking approval under a full BLA. Further, it is possible that a biosimilar applicant could obtain approval for one or more of the indications approved for the innovator product by extrapolating clinical data from one indication to support approval for other indications. In the EU, the EC has similarly granted marketing authorizations for biosimilars once the marketing exclusivity rights for the innovator product have expired. The EMA has published general and product class-specific guidelines to assist biosimilar developers in preparing marketing authorization applications for biosimilars. An applicant for a marketing authorization for a biosimilar in the EU is required to demonstrate through comparability studies with the \u2018reference\u2019 biological medicine that: (i) their biological medicine is highly similar to the reference medicine, notwithstanding natural variability inherent to all biological medicines; and (ii) there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar and the reference medicine in terms of safety, quality and efficacy. Both the United States and the EU provide pathways for biologics competitors to seek approval for biosimilar products at the end of the relevant exclusivity period or, in some circumstances, before such period expires (for example, if a biosimilar applicant obtains approval for one or more of the indications approved for the innovator product by extrapolating clinical data from one indication to support approval for other indications). We are aware of many pharmaceutical and biotechnology and other companies that are actively engaged in research and development of biosimilars or interchangeable products.\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFederal, state and foreign healthcare laws, including anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nManufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, the United States Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough we do not provide healthcare services, submit claims for third-party reimbursement, or receive payments directly from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors for our products, we are subject to broadly applicable healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by federal and state governments. Additionally, healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation of drugs and other medical items and services. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, reporting of payments to physicians and teaching hospitals and patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws.\n \n\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHealthcare fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws potentially applicable to our operations include:\n \n\n\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Law, which makes it illegal for any person to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or certain rebates), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, or in return for, that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. A person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations are subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus imprisonment and exclusion from government healthcare programs. In addition, the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act, or FCA. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. This law applies to our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies and relationships with healthcare providers, by prohibiting, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare or Medicaid programs; \n\n\n\u2022\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the FCA, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment or approval that are false, fictitious or fraudulent; knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false statement or record material to a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to \u201ccause\u201d the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The government may deem manufacturers to have \u201ccaused\u201d the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Companies that submit claims directly to payors may also be liable under the FCA for the direct submission of such claims. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery. When an entity is determined to have violated the FCA, the government may impose civil fines and penalties for each false claim, plus treble damages, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe federal civil monetary penalties laws, which impose civil fines for, among other things, the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and its implementing regulations, which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity can be found guilty of violating HIPAA without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it; \n\n\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, there may be additional federal, state and non-U.S. laws which govern the privacy and security of health and other personal information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts; \n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nfederal \u201csunshine\u201d requirements imposed by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, on drug, device, biological and medical supply manufacturers when payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to HHS under the Open Payments Program, information regarding any payment or other \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately, and completely reported in an annual submission. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners; \n\n\n\u2022\n \n\n\n\u2022\nfederal price reporting laws, which require manufacturers to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs, where such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and/or discounts on approved products; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any United States individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party, or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts; and \n\n\n\u2022\nanalogous state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers or patients; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state and local laws that require the licensure of sales representatives; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information; data privacy and security laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions that may be more stringent than those in the United States (such as the EU, which adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective in May 2018); state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect; and state laws related to insurance fraud in the case of claims involving private insurers. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nChanges in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the voluntary recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the United States, to help patients afford our approved product, we may utilize programs to assist them, including patient assistance programs and co-pay coupon programs for eligible patients. Government enforcement agencies have shown increased interest in pharmaceutical companies\u2019 product and patient assistance programs, including reimbursement support services, and a number of investigations into these programs have resulted in significant civil and criminal settlements. In addition, at least one insurer has directed its network pharmacies to no longer accept co-pay coupons for certain specialty drugs the insurer identified. Our co-pay coupon programs could become the target of similar insurer actions. In addition, in November 2013, CMS issued guidance to the issuers of qualified health plans sold through the ACA\u2019s marketplaces encouraging such plans to reject patient cost-sharing support from third parties and indicating that CMS intends to monitor the provision of such support and may take regulatory action to limit it in the future. CMS subsequently issued a rule requiring individual market qualified health plans to accept third-party premium and\n \n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\ncost-sharing payments from certain government-related entities. In September 2014, the Office of Inspector General, or OIG, of the HHS issued a Special Advisory Bulletin warning manufacturers that they may be subject to sanctions under the federal anti-kickback statute and/or civil monetary penalty laws if they do not take appropriate steps to exclude Part D beneficiaries from using co-pay coupons. Accordingly, companies exclude these Part D beneficiaries from using co-pay coupons.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThird-party patient assistance programs that receive financial support from companies have become the subject of enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny. The OIG has established guidelines that suggest that it is lawful for pharmaceutical manufacturers to make donations to charitable organizations who provide co-pay assistance to Medicare patients, provided that such organizations, among other things, are bona fide charities, are entirely independent of and not controlled by the manufacturer, provide aid to applicants on a first-come basis according to consistent financial criteria, and do not link aid to use of a donor\u2019s product. However, donations to patient assistance programs have received some negative publicity and have been the subject of multiple government enforcement actions, related to allegations regarding their use to promote branded pharmaceutical products over other less costly alternatives. Specifically, in recent years, there have been multiple settlements resulting out of government claims challenging the legality of their patient assistance programs under a variety of federal and state laws.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions, and settlements in the healthcare industry. In November 2020, the OIG issued a Fraud Alert highlighting its view that pharmaceutical promotional speaker programs can pose a high risk of fraud and abuse. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRegulations governing data collection and the use, processing and cross-border transfer of personal information\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have subsidiaries, employees and operations in Europe, which subject us to additional privacy restrictions, including in relation to employee information. We have also conducted, and expect to continue to conduct, clinical trials or continue to enroll subjects in our ongoing or future clinical trials in certain jurisdictions in which we may be subject to additional privacy restrictions. The collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EU, including personal health data, is subject to the GDPR, which became effective in May 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, ensuring certain accountability measures are in place and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EU, including the United States, and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. In addition, the GDPR includes restrictions on cross-border data transfers. The GDPR has increased our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process where such processing is subject to the GDPR, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, including as implemented by individual countries. Compliance with the GDPR will continue to be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation, and reputational harm in connection with our European activities. Furthermore, the Data Protection Act 2018 in the UK \u201cimplements\u201d and complements the EU\u2019s GDPR, and is effective in the UK. In June 2021, the EC adopted an adequacy decision in respect of transfers of personal data to the UK for a four-year period (until June 2025). Similarly, the UK has determined that it considers all of the European Economic Area, or EEA (which consists of the EU Member States, plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) to be adequate for the purposes of data protection. This ensures that data flows between the UK and the EEA remain unaffected.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCalifornia recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which creates new individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. Effective as of January 2020, the CCPA requires covered companies to provide certain disclosures to consumers about its data collection, use and sharing practices, and to provide affected California residents with ways to opt out of certain sales or transfers of personal information, and also regulates employee information. Further, a new California privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, was passed by California voters in November 2020. The CPRA will create additional obligations with respect to processing and storing personal information that are scheduled to take effect in January 2023 (with certain provisions having retroactive effect to January 2022). While there is currently an exception in the CCPA and CPRA for protected\n \n\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nhealth information that is subject to HIPAA, the CCPA and CPRA do and will impact our business activities. Other U.S. states also are considering omnibus privacy legislation and industry organizations regularly adopt and advocate for new standards in these areas.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEU drug development, orphan drug and PRIME designations\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the EU, our product candidates may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory authorities has been obtained.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSimilar to the United States, the various phases of nonclinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, or Directive, has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the Member State regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and Ethics Committees of the Member State where they occurred.\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nIn April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, or Regulation, which replaced the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC in January 2022, overhauling the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU. Specifically, the new Regulation, which is directly applicable in all Member States (meaning that no national implementing legislation in each EU Member State is required), aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU. For instance, the new Regulation provides for a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn November 2016, the EC, acting on a positive recommendation from the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, of the EMA, designated Oxbryta as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of SCD. Orphan drug status in the EU has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits to US orphan drug status, including 10 years of marketing exclusivity from the approval of the marketing authorization, designated product-specific consultation by the EMA, and certain reductions or exemptions in regulatory fees.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn June 2017, the EMA granted PRIME designation for Oxbryta for the treatment of SCD. The PRIME scheme is a regulatory mechanism that provides for early and proactive EMA support to medicine developers to help patients benefit as early as possible from innovative new products that have demonstrated the potential to significantly address an unmet medical need, where there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment in the EU or, if there is, the new medicine will bring a major therapeutic advantage. It is intended to build upon the scientific advice scheme and accelerated assessment procedure offered by EMA. The scheme is voluntary, and eligibility criteria must be met for a medicine to qualify for PRIME. The PRIME scheme is open to medicines under development and for which the applicant intends to make an initial MAA through the Centralized Procedure. If a medicine is selected for the PRIME scheme, the EMA:\n \n\n\n\u2022\nappoints a rapporteur from the CHMP, or from the Committee for Advanced Therapies, or CAT, to provide continuous support and to build up knowledge of the medicine in advance of the filing of a marketing authorization application; \n\n\n\u2022\nissues guidance on the applicant\u2019s overall development plan and regulatory strategy; \n\n\n\u2022\norganizes a kick-off meeting with the rapporteur and experts from relevant EMA committees and working groups; \n\n\n\u2022\nprovides a dedicated EMA contact person; and \n\n\n\u2022\nprovides scientific advice at key development milestones, involving additional stakeholders, such as health technology assessment bodies and patients, as needed. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMedicines that are selected for the PRIME scheme are also expected to benefit from the EMA\u2019s accelerated assessment procedure at the time of application for a marketing authorization. Where, during the course of development, a medicine no longer meets the eligibility criteria, support under the PRIME scheme may be withdrawn.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEU drug review and approval\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the EU, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of MAs:\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe centralized MA is issued by the EC through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the CHMP, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as\n \n\n\n33\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nbiotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines (gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines), and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions, and viral diseases. This mandatory Centralized Procedure applies in the case of Oxbryta for SCD, in light of the 2016 designation of Oxbryta as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of SCD.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnder the Centralized Procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is generally 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of an MAA considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, it provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the EC, who make the final decision to grant a marketing authorization, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA\u2019s recommendation. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is 150 days, excluding clock stops, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the Centralized Procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNational MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EU and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EU, this National MA can be recognized in other Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which an MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SmPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Concerned Member States) for their approval. If the Concerned Member States raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a National MA in all the relevant Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Concerned Member States).\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnder the above-described procedures, before granting an MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNow that the UK (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland) has left the EU, Great Britain will no longer be covered by centralized MAs (under the Northern Irish Protocol, centralized MAs will continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with a current centralized MA were automatically converted to Great Britain MAs in January 2021. For a period of two years from January 2021, the MHRA may rely on a decision taken by the EC on the approval of a new MAA in the Centralized Procedure to more quickly grant a new Great Britain MA. A separate application is required. The MHRA also has the power to have regard to MAs approved in EU Member States through Decentralized or Mutual Recognition Procedures with a view to more quickly granting an MA in the UK.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nEU data and market exclusivity\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the EU, innovative medicinal products, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator\u2019s pre-clinical or clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA in the EU. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar MAA can be submitted, and the innovator\u2019s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EMA to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Even if an innovative medicinal product gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company may market another version of the product if such company obtained an MA based on a MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.\n \n\n\n34\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEU orphan designation and exclusivity\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the EU, the EC, after reviewing the opinion of the EMA\u2019s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are (1) intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions; (2) either (i) such condition affects not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EEA, or (ii) it is unlikely that the development of the medicine, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment in its development and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment for such condition authorized for marketing in the EU or, if such a method exists, the product will be a significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the EU, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following MA approval. During this market exclusivity period, neither the EMA nor the EC nor any of the competent authorities in the EU Member States can accept an application or grant an MA for a \u201csimilar medicinal product.\u201d A \u201csimilar medicinal product\u201d is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. This period may be reduced to six years if, after five years, it is established that the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Market exclusivity may also be revoked in very select cases, such as if (i) it is established that a similar medicinal product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the authorized product; (ii) the marketing authorization holder consents to such revocation; or (iii) the marketing authorization holder cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. In November 2016, we were granted orphan drug designation in the EU for Oxbryta for the potential treatment of SCD.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs of January 2021, a separate process for orphan drug designation applies in Great Britain. There is no pre-marketing authorization orphan designation (as there is in the EU) and the application for orphan designation will be reviewed by the MHRA at the time of the MAA. The criteria are the same as in the EU, except that they apply to Great Britain only (i.e., there must be no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned in Great Britain).\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPediatric Development in EU\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the EU, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree upon a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, with the EMA\u2019s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO, and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless a waiver applies (e.g., because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults). The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which a marketing authorization is being sought. The marketing authorization application for the product must include the results of pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP, unless a waiver applies, or a deferral has been granted by the PDCO of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults, in which case the pediatric clinical trials must be completed at a later date. Products that are granted a marketing authorization with the results of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP are eligible for a six-month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate, or SPC, provided an application for such extension is made at the same time as filing the SPC application for the product, or at any point up to 2 years before the SPC expires, even where the trial results are negative. In the case of orphan medicinal products, a two year extension of the orphan market exclusivity may be available. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nBrexit and the Regulatory Framework in the UK\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn June 2016, the electorate in the UK voted in favor of leaving the EU (commonly referred to as Brexit). Thereafter, in March 2017, the country formally notified the EU of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The UK formally left the EU at the end of January 2020. There was a transition period during which EU pharmaceutical laws continued to apply to the UK, which expired in December 2020. However, the EU and the UK have concluded a trade and cooperation agreement, or TCA, which was provisionally applicable since January 2021 and has been formally applicable since May 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations. At present, Great Britain has implemented EU legislation on the marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products through the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the EU regulatory framework\n \n\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nwill continue to apply in Northern Ireland). The regulatory regime in Great Britain therefore currently aligns with EU regulations, however it is possible that these regimes will diverge in future now that Great Britain\u2019s regulatory system is independent from the EU and the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical legislation. It remains to be seen how Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for medicinal products and devices in the UK in the long-term.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRest of the world regulation\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor other countries outside of the EU and the United States, such as countries in the GCC region, Latin America, Eastern Europe, or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we or our partners fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nReimbursement\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, as well as the level of reimbursement such third-party payors provide for our products. Patients and providers are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists, and one payor\u2019s determination to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for a product does not assure that other payors will make a similar determination. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. Many private payors, however, use coverage decisions and payment amounts determined by CMS as guidelines in setting their coverage and reimbursement policies. The coverage determination process is often time-consuming and costly and is likely to require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor individually, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, and mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies\u2019 share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of HHS as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Effective in 2010, the ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers\u2019 rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP, and adding a new rebate calculation for \u201cline extensions\u201d (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, creating a new methodology by which rebates are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization as of 2010 and by expanding the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits (phased-in by 2014). Pricing and rebate programs must also comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Parts A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a\n \n\n\n36\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\npharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. Any negotiated prices for any of our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although under the current state of the law these newly eligible entities (with the exception of children\u2019s hospitals) will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. As 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, there have been several changes to the 340B drug pricing program, which imposes ceilings on prices that drug manufacturers can charge for medications sold to certain health care facilities. For example, there is ongoing litigation over a change to the reimbursement formula under the 340B drug pricing program that is currently pending before the U.S. Supreme Court. In addition, there are multiple court cases related to attempts by numerous pharmaceutical manufacturers to restrict sales under the 340B program. It is unclear how these developments could affect covered hospitals who might purchase our current or future products and affect the rates we may charge such facilities for such products.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. The plan for the research was published in 2012 by HHS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures are made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of Oxbryta or our product candidates, if any such drug or the condition that they are intended to treat are the subject of such research. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor\u2019s drug could adversely affect the sales of Oxbryta or our product candidates. If third-party payors do not consider our drugs to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our drugs after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment or utilization may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our drugs on a profitable basis.\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nIn recent years, additional laws have resulted in direct or indirect reimbursement reductions for certain Medicare providers, including:\n \n\n\n\u2022\nThe Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, are suspended until March 2021, and are currently scheduled to remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. \n\n\n\u2022\nThe American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThese laws, and future state and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. We expect that an increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n37\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn many foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products, for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower. It can also take a significant period of time after any regulatory approval to obtain various pricing and reimbursement approvals in various member states. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nU.S. Healthcare Reform and regulatory changes\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system that could affect our ability to profitably sell our products. In the United States, there have been and continue to be laws enacted by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control healthcare costs, and generally, to reform the healthcare system in the United States. For example, the ACA was passed in March 2010 and has substantially changed the way healthcare is delivered and financed by both governmental and private insurers. The ACA expanded coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, the ACA, among other things, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. The required discount was increased to 70% in January 2019 pursuant to subsequent legislation.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSome of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges. In June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 2021 through August 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact our business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn October 2017, former President Trump signed an Executive Order terminating the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. The former Trump administration concluded that cost-sharing reduction, or CSR, payments to insurance companies required under the ACA have not received necessary appropriations from Congress and announced that it will discontinue these payments immediately until those appropriations are made. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in October 2017. In August 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in two separate cases that the federal government is liable for the full amount of unpaid CSRs for the years preceding and including 2017. For CSR claims made by health insurance companies for years 2018 and later, further litigation will be required to determine the amounts due, if any. Further, in June 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued the payments were owed to them. However, in April 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's decision and remanded the case to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, concluding the government has an obligation to pay these risk corridor payments under the relevant formula. It is unclear what impact these rulings will have on our business. In addition, in December 2019, former President Trump signed into law the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1865), which repeals the Cadillac tax, the health insurance provider tax, and the medical device excise tax. It is impossible to determine whether similar taxes could be instated in the future.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe full impact of the ACA, any law repealing, replacing, or modifying elements of it, and the political uncertainty surrounding its repeal, replacement, or modification on our business remains unclear. We expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare drugs and services, and in turn could significantly reduce the projected value of certain development projects and reduce our profitability and may increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.\n \n\n\n38\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThere has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices, including for specialty drugs. At the federal level, President Biden signed an Executive Order in July 2021 affirming the administration\u2019s policy to (i) support legislative reforms that would lower the prices of prescription drug and biologics, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, by imposing inflation caps, and, by supporting the development and market entry of lower-cost generic drugs and biosimilars; and (ii) support the enactment of a public health insurance option. Among other things, the Executive Order also directs HHS to provide a report on actions to combat excessive pricing of prescription drugs, enhance the domestic drug supply chain, reduce the price that the Federal government pays for drugs, and address price gouging in the industry; and directs the FDA to work with states and Indian Tribes that propose to develop section 804 Importation Programs in accordance with the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, and the FDA\u2019s implementing regulations.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, in December 2020, HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to court order, the removal and addition of the aforementioned safe harbors have been delayed until January 2023. Further, implementation of this change and new safe harbors for point-of-sale reductions in price for prescription pharmaceutical products and pharmacy benefit manager service fees are currently under review by the Biden administration and may be amended or repealed. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the Biden administration and Congress have indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFinally, in May 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.\n \n\n\nResearch and Development\n \n\n\nResearch and development expenses were $211.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, $155.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $174.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n \n\n\nFinancial Information about Segments\n \n\n\nWe operate in one reporting segment that is dedicated to discovering, developing and commercializing novel therapeutics to treat grievous blood-based disorders.

Oxbryta or any future drug of ours approved for commercial sale may fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community and marketplace. If Oxbryta or any other approved drug does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant revenue from drug sales and we may not become profitable. Before granting reimbursement approval, healthcare payors may require us to demonstrate that the drug, in addition to treating the target indication, also provides incremental health benefits to patients. For example, there have been numerous instances of government and private payors placing restrictions on coverage for products approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, under the FDA\u2019s Subpart H regulations, or Subpart H. Our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors about the benefits of Oxbryta or any future drug approved for commercial sale will require significant resources and may never be successful. The degree of market acceptance of Oxbryta and any other approved drugs that we may pursue will depend on a wide range of factors, including:\n \n\n\n\u2022\nthe demonstrated efficacy and potential advantages of our drugs compared to alternative treatments; \n\n\n\u2022\nour ability to offer our drugs for sale at competitive prices; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe convenience and ease of administration of our drugs compared to alternative current and future treatments; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe willingness of the SCD or other target patient populations to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe availability of our drugs and our ability to meet market demand, including a reliable supply for long-term chronic treatment; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe strength of labeling, marketing and distribution support; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications and approved labeling for which the drug is approved, including labeling restrictions for drugs approved under Subpart H, such as Oxbryta; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects and overall safety profile of the drug; and \n\n\n\u2022\nany restrictions on the use of the drug, including together with other medications. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor example, shortly after we launched Oxbryta, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), evolved into a global pandemic that has significantly impacted people and entities throughout the world. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily suspended our field team from most in-person interactions, including visits to physician offices, clinics and hospitals as well as in-person meetings with payors. While we have more recently increased our face-to-face engagements in some settings following appropriate COVID-19 protocols, we are still utilizing digital and internet-based education and outreach to a greater extent than prior to the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has also reduced our ability to engage with the medical and investor communities. These and other measures have impacted our ability to commercialize Oxbryta and may significantly impact our business in general, and we may continue to experience disruptions to our commercial efforts as well as other disruptions that could materially impact our business.\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf our sales and marketing capabilities for Oxbryta are not effective, or we are unable to establish or secure effective sales and marketing capabilities for any future drug approved for commercial sale in the United States or another geographic market, we may be unsuccessful in our commercial efforts.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn 2019, we established the infrastructure we believed was adequate for the commercial launch of Oxbryta in the United States, which occurred in December 2019. This included establishing a sales and marketing organization with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities to commercialize Oxbryta in the United States. Our commercialization of Oxbryta in the United States will continue to be expensive, difficult, risky and time consuming, and we may not deploy or have adequate resources over time to support the successful commercialization of Oxbryta. This is also true to a lesser extent with respect to our efforts to potentially commercialize Oxbryta in Europe and other areas outside of the United States. Any failures or delays in our commercial efforts, including with respect to any changes in related organizational structures, resources or activities following launch, could adversely impact the commercialization of Oxbryta or any other products, if any are approved.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough many of our employees have experience with commercializing products while employed at other companies, our 2019 launch of Oxbryta is our first experience marketing and selling a drug together as a management team. To successfully commercialize Oxbryta or any other drugs we may develop or obtain, we will need to continue to develop and strengthen our commercial capabilities, either on our own or with others. Our estimate of the size of the required sales force may be materially more or less than the size of the sales force actually required to effectively commercialize Oxbryta or any other product candidates, if any. For example, we may have substantially more sales representatives than required and may incur excess costs as a result.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily suspended our field team from most in-person interactions, including visits to physician offices, clinics and hospitals as well as in-person meetings with payors. While we have more recently increased our face-to-face engagements and are continuing to engage with healthcare professionals and payors through digital and internet-based education and outreach, the impact of utilizing less in-person interactions is unknown, although we believe this may have impacted new patient prescriptions for Oxbryta. We have seen a significant decrease in weekly new patient prescriptions for Oxbryta from a peak in early March 2020, and we expect the rate of new patient prescriptions may remain lower, depending on the course of the pandemic.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAnother potential challenge for our commercial efforts is frequency of doctor visits by SCD patients. We believe that nearly half of Medicaid and Medicare patients living with SCD do not see a hematologist at least once per year. This infrequency of doctor visits, which has been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, may impede prescriptions for Oxbryta.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWith respect to certain geographical markets, we may seek to enter into collaborations with other entities to utilize their local marketing and distribution capabilities, such as our Distribution Agreement with Biopharma-Middle East and Africa, or Biopharma-MEA, to distribute Oxbryta in the Gulf Cooperation Council, or GCC, region, but we may be unable to enter into or maintain such agreements on favorable terms, if at all. If our collaborators do not commit sufficient resources to commercialize Oxbryta or future drugs, if any, and we are unable to develop the necessary sales and marketing capabilities on our own, we will be unable to generate sufficient product revenue to sustain our business. We may also be competing with companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations. For example, in November 2019, the FDA approved Novartis\u2019 biologic, crizanlizumab, for the reduction of the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises, or VOCs, in patients with SCD, in October 2020, Novartis announced that the European Commission, or EC, approved crizanlizumab for the prevention of recurrent VOCs in patients with SCD, and, in October 2021, the UK\u2019s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) announced that it recommends crizanlizumab for use as part of a managed access agreement. Without an effective internal team or the support of a third party to perform marketing and sales functions, we would be unable to compete successfully against more established companies, and our commercial efforts and ability to generate revenues would be impaired.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur profitability will depend significantly on our ability to sell sufficient amounts of product at competitive prices and on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement through governmental or private third-party payors. The insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved products is uncertain in the United States and elsewhere, and failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for Oxbryta or any other products we may develop due to price controls, resource constraints or reimbursement limitations could limit our ability to market those products and impair our ability to generate revenue.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur target patient populations are small, and, accordingly, the pricing, coverage and reimbursement of Oxbryta or any of our product candidates, if approved, must be adequate to support our commercial infrastructure. To achieve profitability, our per-patient prices must be sufficient to recover our development and manufacturing costs and other expenses, and we must be able to sell sufficient amounts of product at these prices. Additionally, the availability of government funded or private insurance coverage for Oxbryta and any other product candidates for any approved indications, if any, and the extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payors, will be essential for most patients to be able to afford Oxbryta or any of our other specialty products, if approved. In\n \n\n\n41\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nparticular, the monthly wholesale acquisition cost, or WAC, for Oxbryta tablets and tablets for oral suspension in the United States is $10,417, and a significant percentage of patients with SCD in the United States rely on government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, for their coverage of drugs and other medical care, so the availability of federal and state coverage of Oxbryta is critical to the success of our commercialization efforts for Oxbryta in the United States. Sales of Oxbryta or any future drug we may develop or obtain will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of such drugs will be paid by third party payors, like private health insurers, including health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, and government health administration programs. If reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize Oxbryta or any future drug we may develop or obtain. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved drug products, and even more uncertainty related to the insurance coverage for products, such as Oxbryta, that receive accelerated approval by the FDA under Subpart H (including in the period before required post-marketing confirmatory studies to verify clinical benefit). The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Moreover, a third-party payor\u2019s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. For example, the payor\u2019s reimbursement payment rate may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. Factors payors consider in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is: a covered benefit under its health plan; safe, effective and medically necessary; appropriate for the specific patient; cost-effective; and neither experimental nor investigational.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the United States, significant decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and federal and state programs enter into contracts with drug manufacturers for discounted drug prices for Medicare, VA/Federal Supply Schedule, 340B and Medicaid under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, among others. The practices and requirements relating to these arrangements are highly complex and subject to differing regulatory requirements and time frames, which will impact the commercialization of Oxbryta. For example, payment of rebates by drug manufacturers for Medicaid purchases are determined by each state, and in some cases, if a company does not enter into a rebate agreement, its Medicaid sales will be subjected to a \u201cprior authorization\u201d procedure that requires state agency approval to qualify a doctor\u2019s prescription for reimbursement. Limitations could also come from entities such as local Medicare carriers, fiscal intermediaries, or Medicare Administrative Contractors. Further, Medicare Part D, which provides a pharmacy benefit to certain Medicare patients, does not require participating prescription drug plans to cover all drugs within a class of products. Our business could be materially adversely affected if private or governmental payors, including Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, were to limit access to, or deny or limit reimbursement of, Oxbryta or any of our product candidates, if approved.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOutside the United States, international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe, Canada, and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the potential pricing and usage of Oxbryta and any future drugs we may develop or obtain. In many countries, such as in various nations in Europe, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems, and changes to these regulations over time contribute to uncertainty regarding the ability to obtain pricing and usage approvals for our product candidates outside of the United States. In addition, the prices of medicines under such systems are, in general, substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation are likely to restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidates outside of the United States. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenues and profits to allow us to commence or continue commercialization in a particular market.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn many non-U.S. jurisdictions, including some countries in the European Union, or EU, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted and reimbursement may in some cases be unavailable. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, which may negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country and products may be subject to continuing governmental control following approval. For example, reimbursement in the EU must be negotiated on a country-by-country basis and, in many countries, the product cannot be commercially launched until reimbursement is approved. Furthermore, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide\n \n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nreimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use, including by approving a specific price for the medicinal product or adopting a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. In addition, to obtain coverage and reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies, or to meet other criteria for pricing approval. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products or product candidates.\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nMoreover, increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payors, in the United States and abroad, to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and levels of reimbursement for new products approved and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for Oxbryta or our product candidates. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of Oxbryta and any future drugs we may develop or obtain, due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative and political changes. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. For example, third-party payors are increasingly requiring higher levels of evidence of the benefits and clinical outcomes of new technologies, benchmarking against other therapies, seeking performance-based discounts, and challenging the prices charged. We cannot be sure that coverage will be available for Oxbryta or any other product we commercialize and, if available, that the reimbursement rates will be adequate, as increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, drug prices are under significant scrutiny in the markets in which our products are or may be sold, and drug pricing and other healthcare costs continue to be subject to intense political and social pressures that we anticipate will continue and escalate on a global basis.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur future profitability will depend, in part, on our ability to commercialize and obtain adequate reimbursement for Oxbryta and our product candidates in markets within and outside of the United States and Europe. If reimbursement for Oxbryta, or our product candidates, if approved, is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, in the United States or, based on the large population of patients with SCD who reside in foreign countries, abroad, our business and operations may be harmed, our stock price may be adversely impacted and experience periods of volatility, we may have difficulty raising funds and our results of operations may be adversely impacted.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur future growth may depend, in part, on our ability to penetrate foreign markets, where we would be subject to additional regulatory burdens and other risks and uncertainties.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur current plans include the pursuit of commercialization for Oxbryta in Europe, the GCC region and Latin America. Commercializing Oxbryta, as well as any future drugs we may develop or obtain, in foreign markets subjects us to additional risks and uncertainties, including:\n \n\n\n\u2022\nthe burden of complying with complex and changing foreign regulatory, tax, accounting, compliance and legal requirements; \n\n\n\u2022\ndifferent medical practices and customs in foreign countries affecting acceptance in the marketplace; \n\n\n\u2022\nimport or export licensing requirements; \n\n\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable collection times; \n\n\n\u2022\nlonger lead times for shipping; \n\n\n\u2022\nlanguage barriers for technical training; \n\n\n\u2022\nreduced protection of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries, and related prevalence of bioequivalent or generic alternatives to therapeutics; \n\n\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations; \n\n\n\u2022\npotential resource constraints, including with respect to patients\u2019 ability to obtain reimbursement for our products in foreign markets; and \n\n\n\u2022\nthe interpretation of contractual provisions governed by foreign laws in the event of a contract dispute. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAny of these factors could impair our ability to commercialize Oxbryta and any future drugs we may develop or obtain outside the United States, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n43\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWith the regulatory approval of Oxbryta, and with respect to any other product candidate that receives regulatory approval in any jurisdiction, we are and will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and scrutiny, which may include significant restrictions relating to product labeling, distribution or other post-marketing requirements.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEven if a product candidate is approved, regulatory authorities may still impose significant restrictions on its indicated uses, approved labeling, distribution or marketing or may impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-marketing studies. For example, because the FDA approved Oxbryta under the accelerated approval pathway under Subpart H, we must conduct at least one post-marketing confirmatory study to verify clinical risk/benefit, which we intend to satisfy through our HOPE-KIDS 2 Study, and we may not be able to successfully and timely complete this study or any other post-marketing confirmatory study as required to maintain approval or achieve full approval. Also, the FDA has restricted the indicated use of Oxbryta under the approved label to patients 4 years and older. While we plan to conduct additional studies to potentially lower the indicated age range to 9 months of age, failure to reach agreement with the FDA on these studies, failure to obtain adequate results from them, or disagreements with regulatory authorities over the interpretation of the results may prevent expansion of the age range within our approved label.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFurthermore, any new legislation addressing drug safety or other drug related issues could result in delays or increased costs to assure compliance. With respect to Oxbryta and any other product candidate that is approved, at a minimum, they will each be subject to current standard ongoing regulatory requirements for labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping and submission of safety and other post-market information, including both federal and state requirements in the United States. In addition, regulatory agencies may not approve labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 or any other product candidates.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor example, the development of Oxbryta for the prophylactic treatment of SCD in pediatric patients is an important part of our current business strategy, and if we are unable to obtain full regulatory approval for Oxbryta for the desired age ranges or other key labeling parameters, our business is likely to suffer.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, manufacturers and their facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs. For Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 and any other product candidates we may pursue, we are wholly reliant on third-party contract manufacturers for clinical as well as any commercial supplies of product candidates and products. As such, we and our contract manufacturers are subject to continual review and periodic inspections to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and must continue to expend time, money, and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, and quality control. We are also required to report certain production problems, if any, to the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for Oxbryta and any future products. In addition, we are subject to obligations to timely report any adverse events or serious adverse events relating to Oxbryta and our product candidates. Our failure to report adverse events we become aware of within the prescribed timeframes could have serious negative consequences for our commercialization, development programs, business and operations. In addition, any promotional communications or materials for prescription drugs are subject to a variety of complex legal and regulatory restrictions, including, but not limited to, consistency with the approved product\u2019s approved label. Failure to obey these standard marketing requirements for Oxbryta or any other approved product, if any, could have serious negative consequences for our commercialization activities, business and operations.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, or disagrees with a sponsor\u2019s activities relating to the promotion, marketing or labeling of a product, these regulatory agencies may impose restrictions or sanctions on that product or us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, in the United States, a wide range of commercialization and pre-launch activities relating to a product candidate are subject to potential for significant civil and/or criminal liability and sanctions under federal anti-kickback and fraud and abuse statutes and regulations. If we fail to comply with any of these complex applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency or enforcement authority may:\n \n\n\n\u2022\nissue untitled or warning letters; \n\n\n\u2022\nimpose civil or criminal penalties; \n\n\n\u2022\nimpose injunctions; \n\n\n\u2022\nimpose fines; \n\n\n\u2022\nimpose additional specialized restrictions on the company\u2019s activities and practices; \n\n\n\u2022\nsuspend regulatory approval; \n\n\n\u2022\nsuspend ongoing clinical trials; \n\n\n\u2022\nseek voluntary or mandatory product recalls and impose publicity requirements; \n\n\n44\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications submitted by us; \n\n\n\u2022\nimpose restrictions on our operations, including closing our contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities; or \n\n\n\u2022\nseize or detain products. \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs a company, our experience with obtaining approval for, launching and commercializing any product candidate or product, and with complying with most of the complex ongoing regulatory requirements for maintaining an approved product on the market has been limited to Oxbryta. It will continue to take significant effort and management attention to address compliance with these requirements with respect to Oxbryta in the United States, in Europe and in any other jurisdiction for which we seek to commercialize Oxbryta or any other product candidate, if approved. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulatory requirements, as well as responding to possible government investigations of alleged violations of law, could require us to expend significant time and resources in response, and could divert management\u2019s attention from our business and generate negative publicity even if significant liabilities do not result. Any failure to comply with these complex ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to commercialize and generate revenues from Oxbryta or to obtain approval for, launch, commercialize and generate revenues from inclacumab, GBT601 or any other product candidates. If we are subject to regulatory sanctions or if regulatory approval for our product candidates is withdrawn or limited, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations would be significantly harmed.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur business operations and current and future relationships with investigators, health care professionals, consultants, third-party payors and customers are or will be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, health information privacy and security laws, and other healthcare laws and regulations. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur current and future operations are or will be directly, or indirectly through our prescribers, customers and third-party payors, subject to various U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations. These laws may impact, among other things, our current business operations, including our sales, marketing, distribution, commercialization, medical and educational programs and our clinical research activities, and they may constrain our business and financial arrangements and relationships with healthcare providers, physicians and other parties through which we market, sell and distribute Oxbryta and any future drugs we may develop or obtain. We may also be subject to additional healthcare, statutory and regulatory requirements and enforcement by foreign regulatory authorities in jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims laws, the U.S. Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and analogous state laws and regulations such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws and analogous non-U.S. fraud and abuse laws and regulations, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEnsuring that our business activities (including our operations and arrangements with third parties) comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is complex, time-consuming, costly and could materially impact our operations. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse, price reporting or other healthcare laws and regulations.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough an effective compliance program can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these requirements, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal, state and foreign privacy, security, and fraud requirements is costly. Any action against us for violation of these requirements, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from our business and operations, and could negatively impact the price of our common stock.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform and other factors. Federal and state enforcement bodies in the United States regularly pursue a large number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry, and in the EU, enforcement of the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, known as GDPR, is increasing. Ensuring that our internal operations and future business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion of products or individuals from U.S. government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Further, defending against any such\n \n\n\n45\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nactions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to not be in compliance with applicable requirements, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs and imprisonment. If any of the above occur, it could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHealthcare legislative reform measures may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could restrict or regulate post-approval activities, affect our ability to profitably sell Oxbryta and any other drug candidates for which we obtain marketing approval, and prevent or delay marketing approval of our drug candidates. For example, in 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act or ACA, was passed, which substantially changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. Since its enactment, there have been many judicial, executive and legislative challenges to numerous aspects of the ACA. The full impact on our business of the ACA, the potential impacts of any challenges, including any laws repealing and/or replacing elements of it, as well as the political uncertainty surrounding any repeal or replacement legislation, remain unclear.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, at the federal level, statutes and regulations routinely impact a variety of parameters relating to federal programs and Medicaid. For example, CMS\u2019s final rule regarding the Medicaid drug rebate program, issued in 2016, revised the manner in which the \u201caverage manufacturer price\u201d is to be calculated by manufacturers participating in the program. The full impact of these federal laws and regulations, as well as other new laws and reform measures that may be proposed and adopted in the future, remains uncertain, but may result in additional reductions in Medicaid and other health care funding, or higher production costs which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and, accordingly, our financial operations.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThere have been multiple recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed and adopted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs and biologics. In addition, Congress and multiple presidential administrations have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAt the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for Oxbryta and our drug candidates, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing over time.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMoreover, there have been a number of other legislative and regulatory changes in recent years aimed at the biopharmaceutical industry. For instance, the Drug Quality and Security Act imposes obligations on manufacturers of biopharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements of this legislation, manufacturers are required to provide certain information regarding the product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, to label product with a product identifier, and to keep certain records regarding the product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers must be done electronically. Manufacturers are also required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers\u2019 products are appropriately licensed. Further, manufacturers have product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and FDA and trading partner notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products that would result in serious adverse health consequences or death to humans, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe expect federal and state healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future in the United States may result in more rigorous coverage criteria, increased regulatory burdens and operating costs, decreased net revenue from our pharmaceutical products and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for Oxbryta and any of our drug candidates approved for use. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. These legislative and executive efforts have significantly increased uncertainty regarding the availability of healthcare programs, insurance coverage and reimbursement as a general matter as well as for Oxbryta and our product candidates, and we cannot predict how these events will impact our business or operations.\n \n\n\n46\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAccordingly, at this time it is difficult to determine the full impact of these efforts on our business. In the United States, many patients with SCD participate in the Medicaid program, and the impact of uncertainty or changes relating to the ACA or healthcare programs, insurance coverage or reimbursement generally have a particularly significant impact on our business or results of operations. Additionally, it is possible that changes in insurer policies regarding co-pay coupons and/or the introduction and enactment of new legislation or regulatory action could restrict or otherwise negatively affect our patient support programs, which could result in fewer patients using Oxbryta or other products that we may develop and commercialize, and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our sales, business and financial condition.\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe face intense competition and rapid technological change and the possibility that our competitors may develop therapies that are similar, more advanced, or more effective than ours, which may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to successfully commercialize Oxbryta and our product candidates.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We are currently aware of various existing therapies and development candidates that are or may compete with Oxbryta,  inclacumab and GBT601 for the potential treatment of SCD. For example, the FDA approved Novartis\u2019 crizanlizumab in November 2019. Both crizanlizumab and inclacumab are human monoclonal antibodies against P-selectin for the treatment of VOCs in patients with SCD. The FDA\u2019s approval of crizanlizumab resulted in another new and innovative SCD product entering the United States SCD market approximately one week earlier than Oxbryta, and substantially earlier than any potential approval of our inclacumab product candidate (which could be a direct competitor to crizanlizumab) or GBT601. In addition, Novartis announced in October 2020 that the EC approved crizanlizumab for the prevention of recurrent VOCs in patients with SCD, and, in October 2021, the UK\u2019s NICE announced that it recommends crizanlizumab for use as part of a managed access agreement, which meant that crizanlizumab was approved in Europe before the EC approved Oxbryta for use in the EU. As a result, the commercialization of crizanlizumab may impact our commercialization of Oxbryta, as well as inclacumab and GBT601 if we are successful in developing and obtaining approval for such product candidates for SCD patients.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have competitors both in the United States and internationally, including major multinational pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, and biotechnology companies. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources, such as larger research and development, marketing and manufacturing organizations. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. As a result, these companies may obtain regulatory approval more rapidly than we are able to and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products as well. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis, products that are more effective or less costly than any product candidate that we may develop, or achieve earlier patent protection, regulatory approval, product commercialization and market penetration than we do. Additionally, technologies developed by our competitors may render Oxbryta or our product candidates uneconomical or obsolete, and we may not be successful in marketing any drugs or product candidates against competitors.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf the market opportunities for Oxbryta or our product candidates are smaller than we believe they are, our revenue may be adversely affected, and our business may suffer. Our ability to successfully identify patients and acquire a significant market share will be necessary for us to achieve profitability and growth.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur initial development and commercialization efforts are focused on the potential of Oxbryta to treat SCD. Our projections of both the number of people who have SCD, as well as the subset of people with SCD who have the potential to benefit from treatment with Oxbryta, are based on our beliefs and estimates. These estimates have been derived from a variety of sources, including the scientific literature, and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of SCD. The number of patients may turn out to be lower than expected. The effort to identify patients with diseases we seek to treat is ongoing, and we cannot accurately predict the number of patients for whom treatment might be possible. Additionally, the potential addressable patient population for Oxbryta and our product candidates may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with Oxbryta or our product candidates, and new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, which would adversely affect our results of operations and our business. Restrictions on labeling of any approved product, including any restrictions that may be imposed in connection with any approval under Subpart H, may also limit the size of the potential market for Oxbryta and our product candidates. Further, even if we obtain significant market share for Oxbryta or any other drug we may develop or obtain, because the potential target populations are small, we may never achieve profitability despite obtaining such significant market share.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n47\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position, Our Need for Additional Capital and Our Indebtedness\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company with only one drug approved for marketing in the United States and with a limited operating history. We have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We have generated limited revenue since our inception, which, together with our limited operating history, may make it difficult for you to assess our future viability.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company with only one drug, Oxbryta, approved for marketing, and Oxbryta is currently approved for marketing only in two major markets, the United States and the EU. We also have a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects. Biopharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. To date, we have focused principally on developing Oxbryta, and our current clinical development activities are focused on Oxbryta and our drug candidates. We are not profitable and have incurred losses in each year since our inception in February 2011 and the commencement of our principal operations in May 2012. Our net losses were $303.1 million and $247.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.3 billion. We only began to generate revenues with the December 2019 commercial launch of Oxbryta, and have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and, to a lesser extent, through debt financing, including convertible debt. We continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations and expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate these losses will increase as we:\n \n\n\n\u2022\ncommercialize Oxbryta and continue related clinical development, including conducting (i) our Phase 2a HOPE-KIDS 1 Study of Oxbryta, (ii) our Phase 3 HOPE-KIDS 2 Study, which we intend to serve as our post-confirmatory study of Oxbryta in SCD (and any other post-marketing studies that may be required by regulatory authorities, if any), and (iii) any additional clinical trials of Oxbryta we may conduct now or in the future in SCD patients or for any other indications for Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 or any other product candidates, if any; \n\n\n\u2022\nestablish and maintain manufacturing and supply relationships with third parties that can provide adequate supplies (in amount and quality) of Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 or any other product candidates to support commercialization and further clinical development; \n\n\n\u2022\nseek and obtain additional regulatory and marketing approvals for Oxbryta for SCD, including for younger pediatric patient populations, or any potential approvals we may pursue for other product candidates; \n\n\n\u2022\nmaintain a sales and marketing organization and enter into selected collaborations to commercialize Oxbryta for SCD or any other approved indication, as well as for any other product candidates; \n\n\n\u2022\nmaintain a medical affairs organization to advance our engagement with healthcare providers and stakeholders; \n\n\n\u2022\nadvance our other programs, including inclacumab, GBT601 and any other product candidates, through nonclinical and clinical development and commence development activities for any additional product candidates we may identify and pursue; and \n\n\n\u2022\nexpand our organization to support our commercialization, research, development and medical activities and our operations as a public company. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPrior to the December 2019 commercial launch of Oxbryta, we had never generated any revenues from product sales, and we may never be able to achieve significant revenues or profitability. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our failure to maintain adequate cash reserves to commercialize Oxbryta, advance our development programs or achieve approval to commercialize any other products, or our failure to achieve sustained profitability, would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, market Oxbryta, diversify our research and development pipeline, market any other product candidates we may identify and pursue (if approved), or continue our operations. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may require substantial additional funds to achieve our business goals. If we are unable to obtain such funds when needed and on acceptable terms, we could be forced to delay, limit or terminate our commercialization activities for Oxbryta, our product development efforts or other operations. Raising additional capital may subject us to unfavorable terms, cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to Oxbryta, our product candidates or technologies.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are currently commercializing Oxbryta and investigating Oxbryta in clinical development to support its potential full approval by the FDA and opportunities for potential label expansion. Among other activities, we are evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of Oxbryta in our HOPE-KIDS 1 Study, a Phase 2a clinical trial in adolescent and pediatric patients with SCD. Our clinical program for Oxbryta also includes our HOPE-KIDS 2 Study, which is our TCD\n \n\n\n48\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\npost-confirmatory study of Oxbryta in SCD (to potentially satisfy the FDA\u2019s requirement for a post-confirmatory study under Subpart H). In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily delayed or paused our research and development activities, including temporarily pausing screening and enrollment in all GBT-sponsored clinical trials (including our HOPE-KIDS 2 Study). Activities on our clinical trials have resumed, with measures in place that we believe are appropriate. In addition, we have initiated and plan to initiate clinical trials on our product candidates, inclacumab and GBT601, and we are conducting nonclinical research activities in other programs. While we have resumed clinical trial activities, we have continued to see a negative impact on enrollment and certain other aspects of our clinical trials that we believe are related to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, and we do not know with any certainty the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our clinical development activities.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDiscovering, developing and commercializing biopharmaceutical products is expensive and time-consuming, and we expect our selling, general and administrative and research and development expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue to commercialize Oxbryta and engage in research and development efforts for Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 and other product candidates that we may identify and pursue in clinical trials. As of December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, we had working capital of $714.0 million and $553.1 million, respectively, and capital resources consisting of cash and cash equivalents and investments totaling $734.8 million and $560.9 million, respectively. We expect that our existing capital resources consisting of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. Because the outcome of commercialization, reimbursement and any clinical development and regulatory approval process is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual capital amounts necessary to successfully commercialize Oxbryta and complete our ongoing and planned additional development of activities for Oxbryta or any other product candidates.\n \n\n\nOur operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, such as strategic collaborations or license and development agreements. Any additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 or any other product candidates that we may identify and pursue. Moreover, such financing may result in dilution to stockholders, imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations, or other restrictions that may affect our business. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n \n\n\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully commercialize Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 and any other product candidates we may identify and develop; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe manufacturing, selling, and marketing costs associated with the commercialization of Oxbryta and the potential commercialization of inclacumab, GBT601 and any other product candidates we may identify and develop, including the cost and timing of establishing or maintaining our sales and marketing capabilities in any territory(ies); \n\n\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of sales and other revenues from Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 and any other product candidates we may identify and develop, including the sales price and the availability of adequate third-party reimbursement; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe time and cost necessary to conduct and complete multiple ongoing studies (including our HOPE-KIDS 1 Study, our Phase 3 HOPE-KIDS 2 Study and other studies); \n\n\n\u2022\nthe time and cost necessary to conduct and complete any additional clinical studies required to pursue additional regulatory approvals for Oxbryta for SCD, including our Phase 3 HOPE-KIDS 2 Study (which is necessary to move from our current Subpart H approval to a full approval) and any studies to support potential label expansions into younger SCD pediatric populations, or any other post-marketing studies for Oxbryta for SCD; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe progress, data and results of clinical trials of Oxbryta and product candidates; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe progress, timing, scope and costs of our nonclinical studies, our clinical trials and other related activities, including our ability to enroll subjects in a timely manner for our ongoing and future clinical trials of Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 or any other product candidate that we may identify and develop; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe costs of obtaining clinical and commercial supplies of Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 and any other product candidates we may identify and develop; \n\n\n\u2022\nour ability to advance our development programs, including for Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 and any other potential product candidate programs we may identify and pursue, the timing and scope of these development activities, and the availability of approval for any of our other product candidates; \n\n\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully obtain any additional regulatory approvals from any regulatory authorities, and the scope of any such regulatory approvals, to market and sell Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 and any other product candidates we may identify and develop in any territory(ies); \n\n\n49\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nthe cash requirements of any future acquisitions or discovery of product candidates; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe time and cost necessary to respond to technological and market developments; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we may acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies, and the costs and timing associated with any such acquisitions or in-licenses; \n\n\n\u2022\nour ability to attract, hire, and retain qualified personnel; and \n\n\n\u2022\nthe costs of maintaining, expanding, and protecting our intellectual property portfolio. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdditional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to delay, limit or terminate our development or commercialization activities for Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 or for any other product candidates we may identify and pursue, or be unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, as desired, which could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness. Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, our total indebtedness was $580.4 million, including $334.0 million of indebtedness outstanding under our 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2028, or the 2028 Notes, and $246.4 million of indebtedness under our amended and restated loan agreement, or Term Loan, with funds managed by Pharmakon Advisors LP, which are BioPharma Credit PLC, as collateral agent, BPCR Limited Partnership, as a lender, and Biopharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP, as a lender. Subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness, we may incur additional indebtedness, secure existing or future indebtedness or refinance our indebtedness. We may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, depends on our future performance and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations, which are subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Such payments will reduce the funds available to us for research and development, working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for research and development, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans and other investments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, the industry or in the general economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry, and prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise. Additionally, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our indebtedness and fund our operations, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, to the extent the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, such as risks associated with our indebtedness under the 2028 Notes, the Term Loan, our need to raise additional capital to support our operations and to service our indebtedness, and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness.\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have incurred indebtedness under convertible senior notes and are party to a loan and security agreement that contains operating covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn December 2021, we issued the 2028 Notes, pursuant to which we pay interest semiannually in arrears at a rate of 1.875% per year. The 2028 Notes will mature on December 15, 2028, unless earlier converted or repurchased, at which time we will settle any conversions of the 2028 Notes in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. Under certain circumstances, the holders of the 2028 Notes may require us to repay all or a portion of the principal and interest outstanding under the 2028 Notes in cash prior to their maturity date, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn December 2021, we entered into the Term Loan, for a senior secured credit facility under which we were extended an additional $100.0 million in addition to the initial term loan tranche in an aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million that was drawn upon execution of the original loan agreement, or the Prior Loan Agreement in December 2019 and a subsequent term loan tranche in an aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million that was drawn under the Prior Loan Agreement in November 2020. Borrowings under the Term Loan are secured by a first priority security interest in and a lien on substantially all of our assets, subject to certain exceptions.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Term Loan restricts our ability, among other things, to:\n \n\n\n\u2022\nsell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of our business or property, subject to limited exceptions; \n\n\n\u2022\nmake certain changes to our organizational structure; \n\n\n\u2022\nconsolidate or merge with other entities or acquire other entities; \n\n\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or create encumbrances on our assets; \n\n\n\u2022\npay dividends, other than dividends paid solely in shares of our common stock, or make distributions on and, in certain cases, repurchase our stock; \n\n\n\u2022\nrepay subordinated indebtedness; or \n\n\n\u2022\nmake certain investments. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, we are required under the Term Loan to comply with various operating covenants and default clauses that may restrict our ability to finance our operations, engage in business activities or expand or fully pursue our business strategies. A breach of any of these covenants or clauses could result in a default under the Term Loan, which could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under the facility to become immediately due and payable.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAny inability to comply with the terms of the 2028 Notes or the Term Loan may negatively affect our business operations and financial condition.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nConversion of the convertible debt securities, such as the 2028 Notes, may dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board published Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-06, \nDebt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging\u2014Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)\n, which we have early adopted. The standard changes the accounting for the convertible debt instruments, which includes eliminating beneficial conversion feature and cash conversion models resulting in more convertible instruments being accounted for as a single unit, and simplifies classification of debt on the balance sheet and earnings-per-share calculations. The if-converted method will be required to be used for all convertible instruments that can be settled in whole or in part in cash, including the 2028 Notes, in calculating dilutive earnings per share. The \u201cif-converted\u201d method may dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. Upon conversion of the 2028 Notes, as we have elected to irrevocably fix the settlement method to physical settlement in the indenture governing the notes, any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the 2028 Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the 2028 Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the 2028 Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe capped call transactions that we entered into in connection with the 2028 Notes may adversely affect the value of our common stock.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn connection with the pricing of the 2028 Notes, we entered into capped call transactions, which we refer to as the Capped Calls, with certain of the initial purchasers of the 2028 Notes and other financial institutions, which we refer to as the Capped Call Counterparties. The Capped C\nalls are expected generally to reduce the potential equity dilution upon conversion of any of the 2028 Notes, with such reduction subject to a cap. In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the Capped Calls, the Capped Call Counterparties or their respective affiliates have advised us that they purchased shares of our common stock or entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock. The Capped Call Counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock or purchasing or selling our common stock or other of our securities in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the 2028 Notes (and are likely to do so on each exercise date for the Capped Calls, which are expected to occur on each trading day during the 30 trading day period beginning on the 31st scheduled trading day prior to the maturity date of the notes, or following any termination of any portion of the Capped Calls in connection with any repurchase, redemption or early conversion of the 2028 Notes). This activity could cause a decrease or avoid an increase in the market price of our common stock. The potential effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n51\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call transactions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Capped Call Counterparties are financial institutions, and we are subject to the risk that any or all of them might default under the Capped Calls. Our exposure to the credit risk of the Capped Call Counterparties will not be secured by collateral. Past global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If a Capped Call Counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under the Capped Calls with such Capped Call Counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors, but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price and in the volatility of our\n common stock. In addition, upon a default by a Capped Call Counterparty, we may suffer more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of the Capped Call Counterparties.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe phase-out, replacement, or unavailability of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, could affect interest rates under the Term Loan, as well as our ability to obtain future debt financing on favorable terms.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are subject to interest rate risk on floating interest rate borrowings under the Term Loan. Borrowings under our credit facilities use the three-month LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the regulatory authority over LIBOR) stated that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark after 2021 to allow for an orderly transition to an alternative reference rate, and alternatives have been proposed. The Term Loan provides that in the event the three-month LIBOR is not available as a benchmark for determining the applicable interest rate under the Term Loan or a specific date is identified after which the three-month LIBOR shall no longer be used for determining interest rates for loans, we and the lender will endeavor to establish an alternative rate of interest that gives consideration to the then prevailing market convention for determining a rate of interest for loans in the United States and will enter into an amendment to the Term Loan to reflect such rate as agreed between the parties, along with such other related changes to the Term Loan as may be applicable. It is not presently known whether any alternative reference rates to the three-month LIBOR that have been proposed will attain long-term market acceptance as replacements of the three-month LIBOR. In addition, the overall financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Furthermore, the consequences of the transition from LIBOR could result in an increase in the cost of our borrowings on our variable rate debt, which could adversely impact our interest expense, results of operations and cash flows. Uncertainty as to the nature of such phase-out and selection of an alternative reference rate, together with disruption in the financial markets, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and may adversely affect our ability to obtain future debt financing on favorable terms.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Business and the Clinical Development, Regulatory Review and Approval of Our Product Candidates\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we are unable to obtain regulatory approval to further expand Oxbryta\u2019s label in the United States or regulatory approval in additional jurisdictions for Oxbryta or one or more jurisdictions for inclacumab, GBT601 or any other product candidates that we may identify and develop, our business will be substantially harmed.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe cannot commercialize a product until the appropriate regulatory authorities have reviewed and approved the product candidate. Approval by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities such as the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, is lengthy and unpredictable and depends upon numerous factors. Approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions, which may cause delays in the approval or the decision not to approve an application. We have obtained regulatory approval for Oxbryta only in two major markets, the United States and the EU. In addition, Great Britain will no longer be covered by centralized MAs, which includes our MA for Oxbryta, as a result of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU (often referred to as Brexit). Accordingly, we are utilizing the EC Decision Reliance Procedure available for a period of two years from January 1, 2021, to seek approval of Oxbryta in Great Britain by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA. While utilizing the EC Decision Reliance Procedure may significantly accelerate the potential regulatory approval of Oxbryta in Great Britain as compared to making a completely separate application in parallel to our MAA with the EMA, there is no guarantee as to if or when the MHRA will approve such application. Under our distributorship arrangement in the GCC, we plan to seek additional regulatory approvals for Oxbryta over time in the relevant countries. It is possible that we will never obtain these or any other regulatory approvals for Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 or any other product candidates we may seek to develop in the future.\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nApplications for product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including, but not limited to:\n \n\n\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities (including the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities) that Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 or any other product candidates we may develop are safe and effective for any proposed indications; \n\n\n52\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our plans or expectations regarding the pathways and endpoints for approval, including the availability of accelerated approval, or the design or implementation of our nonclinical studies or clinical trials; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe populations studied in our clinical programs may not be sufficiently broad or representative to assure safety or demonstrate efficacy in the full population for which we seek approval; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials beyond those we anticipate; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data and results from our nonclinical studies or clinical trials; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe data and results collected from nonclinical studies or clinical trials of Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 and any other product candidates that we may identify and pursue may not be sufficient to support the submission for regulatory approval; \n\n\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate\u2019s risk-benefit ratio for its proposed indication is acceptable; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may find deficiencies with or fail to approve the manufacturing processes, test procedures and specifications, or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract and rely on for all clinical and commercial supplies of Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 and any other product candidates (if any); and \n\n\n\u2022\nthe approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may change in a manner that renders our development or manufacturing efforts insufficient for approval. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe lengthy regulatory review and approval process, as well as the inherent unpredictability of the results of nonclinical studies and clinical trials, and our reliance on third-party manufacturers for any product candidates, may result in our failure to obtain regulatory approval to market Oxbryta in additional jurisdictions outside of the United States or to market inclacumab, GBT601 or other product candidates that we may pursue in the United States or elsewhere, which would significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nExpedited development and regulatory approval programs for Oxbryta, such as the accelerated approval under Subpart H, may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, may not lead to any approval, and may lead to an approval that is later withdrawn.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe FDA approved Oxbryta through the accelerated approval process under Subpart H, and also approved under the accelerated approval process under Subpart H our regulatory application that expanded the Oxbryta label to include treatment of SCD in children ages 4 to 11 years. While the FDA approved Oxbryta under Subpart H, we cannot be assured that any other product candidates that we may develop will qualify for or benefit from any such expedited programs in the United States, including under Subpart H, or in any foreign regulatory jurisdictions. \n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn June 2017, the EMA granted PRIME designation for Oxbryta for the treatment of SCD. The PRIME scheme is a regulatory mechanism that provides for early and proactive EMA support to medicine developers to help patients benefit as early as possible from innovative new products that have demonstrated the potential to significantly address an unmet medical need. We cannot be assured that Oxbryta or any other product candidates that we may develop will benefit from a PRIME designation.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDrugs approved under Subpart H are required to be further evaluated in at least one post-marketing study to verify clinical benefit. To satisfy such requirement, we are conducting our TCD post-confirmatory study, the HOPE-KIDS 2 Study. We previously announced that the FDA agreed that TCD flow velocity would be an acceptable primary endpoint in a post-approval confirmatory study of Oxbryta to demonstrate stroke risk reduction for purposes of full approval by the FDA and that we had reached final agreement with the FDA on the design of the TCD post-confirmatory study.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may not be able to complete the HOPE-KIDS 2 Study or any other successful post-marketing confirmatory study as required to maintain approval and achieve full approval. In addition, data and results from our required post-marketing confirmatory program may not verify Oxbryta\u2019s clinical benefit to maintain approval and achieve full approval, in which case the product may be required to be withdrawn from market approval.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe temporarily paused screening and enrollment on our HOPE-KIDS 2 Study due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Activities on our clinical trials have resumed, with measures in place that we believe are appropriate. While we have resumed clinical\n \n\n\n53\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\ntrial activities, we have continued to see a negative impact on enrollment and certain other aspects of our clinical trials that we believe are related to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, and we do not know with any certainty the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our HOPE-KIDS 2 Study.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAccess to any expedited program, including through the FDA (such as accelerated approval under Subpart H), may be withdrawn by the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority if it believes that the program is no longer supported by data from our clinical development, and accelerated approval under Subpart H may be withdrawn if, among other reasons, required post-marketing confirmatory studies are not completed or if the FDA determines the results of post-marketing confirmatory studies do not verify clinical benefit.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAll of our programs other than Oxbryta are still in earlier development stages, so we remain very reliant on the potential success of Oxbryta in the clinic and in the marketplace. If we are unable to successfully commercialize Oxbryta for SCD or complete clinical development activities for Oxbryta in accordance with our plans, or experience delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo date, we have invested a majority of our efforts and financial resources in the nonclinical and clinical development of Oxbryta, including conducting nonclinical studies and clinical trials, seeking regulatory approval, and providing general and administrative support for these operations. Our other clinical product candidates are in the earlier stages of development, and our only clinical development program for Oxbryta is in SCD. Our future success is highly dependent on our ability to successfully continue to develop, obtain and maintain regulatory approval for, and commercialize Oxbryta inside and outside the United States for SCD.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are evaluating Oxbryta in SCD patients in our ongoing HOPE-KIDS 1 Study, our HOPE-KIDS 2 Study (which is our post-approval confirmatory study), and other ongoing and planned clinical trials. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily delayed or paused certain of our research and development activities, including temporarily pausing screening and enrollment in all GBT-sponsored clinical trials. Activities on our clinical trials have resumed, with measures in place that we believe are appropriate. While we have resumed clinical trial activities, we have continued to see a negative impact on enrollment and certain other aspects of our clinical trials that we believe are related to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, and we do not know with any certainty the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our clinical development activities. Additionally, our current and planned clinical trials, as well as sickle cell-related clinical trials of other entities, target the same or similar patient populations, and the competition to enroll such patients could make our enrollment slower or more difficult than expected.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAll of our other programs are in earlier stages of research and development. As a result, even after in-licensing the inclacumab program, we are very dependent on Oxbryta for our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. We are also very dependent on the data and results that we obtain over time from our clinical program for Oxbryta, including the HOPE-KIDS 2 Study. The primary endpoint of the HOPE-KIDS 2 Study relates to TCD measurement, and we have not previously conducted any Phase 3 clinical study of Oxbryta in SCD patients using this primary endpoint, nor do we believe this measure has been used as a primary endpoint for any registrational studies for any other SCD therapies.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs we continue our clinical development of Oxbryta, the additional data we generate could be different from, including less favorable in terms of efficacy and/or safety, than the data generated and discussed with the FDA to date. If this were to occur, it could significantly impact our continued development and commercialization of Oxbryta. In addition, depending on the results we obtain from our HOPE-KIDS 2 Study, which we intend to satisfy our post-approval confirmatory requirement under Subpart H, accelerated approval of Oxbryta under Subpart H may be withdrawn (which would also mean full approval would not be achieved, and could also mean that Oxbryta could be required to be removed from the market) if the required post-marketing confirmatory program is not completed or if the FDA determines the results do not verify clinical risk/benefit. We do not have a special protocol assessment agreement in place with the FDA for our HOPE-KIDS 2 Study.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe cannot be certain that Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 or any other product candidates that we seek to develop will be successful in nonclinical studies or clinical trials or receive and maintain any regulatory approvals. If we do not receive regulatory approval for, regulatory approval is withdrawn from, or we otherwise fail to successfully commercialize Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 or any other product candidates, we are likely to need to spend significant additional time and resources to identify other product candidates, advance them through nonclinical and clinical development and apply for regulatory approvals, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n54\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe development of Oxbryta as a potential disease-modifying anti-sickling agent in SCD patients represents a novel therapeutic approach, and there is a risk that the outcomes of our clinical trials will not be favorable or otherwise support any further decision to seek, grant, expand the scope of, or maintain, any regulatory approval.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have concentrated our product research and development efforts on developing novel, mechanism-based therapeutics for the treatment of grievous blood-based disorders with significant unmet need, and our future success depends on the success of this therapeutic approach. The clinical trial requirements of the FDA and other comparable regulatory agencies and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of any product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of the potential product. To date, there are only four approved therapies for SCD, Oxbryta, crizanlizumab, hydroxyurea, and L-glutamine, and Oxbryta is the first approved therapy directed toward preventing the polymerization of hemoglobin molecules as a mechanism to reduce red blood cell sickling in SCD patients. As a result, the design and conduct of clinical trials for a therapeutic product candidate such as Oxbryta that targets this mechanism in SCD patients are subject to unknown risks, and we may experience setbacks with our ongoing or planned clinical trials of Oxbryta in SCD because of the limited clinical experience with its mechanism of action in these patients.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn particular, regulatory authorities in the United States and Europe have not issued definitive guidance as to how to measure and achieve efficacy in treatments for SCD. Based on our discussions with the FDA regarding the design for the HOPE Study, we determined to measure change in hemoglobin levels as the primary endpoint in the Phase 3 HOPE Study. This primary endpoint had not been used previously in a registration study for any SCD treatment. While the FDA as well as the EC granted marketing approval for Oxbryta partly on the basis of this novel endpoint, other regulators may not accept such data as support for a regulatory application or approval.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe did not achieve statistically significant results with respect to either potential key secondary endpoint in Part A of the HOPE Study (relating to episodes of VOCs and to the Patient Reported Outcome instrument developed by us), and we may not achieve key endpoints in other clinical trials, including any post-marketing confirmatory studies for Oxbryta. In addition, we may not achieve the same results with respect to the primary endpoint in Part A of the HOPE Study in other ongoing of future clinical trials, including our ongoing TCD post-confirmatory study, the HOPE-KIDS 2 Study. Any inability to design clinical trials with protocols and endpoints acceptable to applicable regulatory authorities, and to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 and any other product candidates that we may pursue, would have an adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nResults of earlier studies may not be predictive of future clinical trial results, and initial studies may not establish or maintain an adequate safety or efficacy profile for Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 or other product candidates that we may pursue to justify proceeding to advanced clinical trials or an application for regulatory approval.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe results of nonclinical studies and clinical trials of Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 and of any other product candidates that we may pursue may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial may not necessarily predict final results. For example, our nonclinical studies and clinical trials to date of Oxbryta in SCD have involved mostly one genotype of SCD, known as HbSS, and the results of these studies may not be replicated in other genotypes of SCD in clinical trials or in the general patient population. In addition, the results obtained in our development program for SCD patients aged 12 years and older, such as in our Phase 3 HOPE Study, may not be replicated in our ongoing studies in pediatric populations, including our HOPE-KIDS 1 Study and HOPE-KIDS 2 Study.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nProducts evaluated in post-marketing studies and product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to demonstrate the desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through nonclinical studies and earlier clinical trials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier studies, and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. Since Oxbryta was approved under Subpart H requiring successful completion of a confirmatory clinical trial to obtain full FDA approval, if the results of our confirmatory study fail to demonstrate efficacy and safety adequate to obtain full regulatory approval for Oxbryta and maintain its marketing approval in the United States, this would have a substantial impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, nonclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to various interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in nonclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval, in part because of differing interpretations of data and results by regulatory authorities. For example, our HOPE-KIDS 1 Study designed to evaluate the effect of Oxbryta on exercise capacity, as measured by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) in patients 12 years of age and older with SCD, utilizes an \u201copen-label\u201d trial design, and we may use open-label trial designs in the future. An open-label clinical trial is one in which both the patient and investigator know whether the patient is receiving the investigational product candidate or either an existing approved drug or placebo. In many cases, open-label clinical trials\n \n\n\n55\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\ntest only the investigational product candidate and sometimes may do so at different dose levels, as in the case of our HOPE-KIDS 1 Study. Open-label clinical trials may be subject to \u201cpatient bias,\u201d where patients perceive their symptoms to have improved merely due to their awareness of receiving the treatment under investigation, or \u201cinvestigator bias,\u201d where those assessing and reviewing the physiological outcomes of the clinical trials are aware of the treatment administered to patients and may interpret the information of a treated group more favorably given this knowledge. The results from an open-label trial may not be predictive of future clinical trial results with Oxbryta or any of our product candidates when studied in a controlled environment with a placebo or active control. In addition, data and results from later studies or programs may conflict with earlier findings for a variety of other reasons.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur failure to demonstrate the required characteristics to support continued marketing of Oxbryta, full FDA approval, additional marketing approval for Oxbryta inside or outside of the United States, or marketing approval for inclacumab, GBT601 or any other product candidate we may choose to develop, in any ongoing or future clinical trials would substantially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBefore we are able to obtain any marketing approval for Oxbryta outside of the United States and the EU, foreign regulatory authorities may impose additional requirements, the scope of which are not fully known at this time.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBefore we can obtain any marketing approval for a product candidate for any potential indication, we must successfully complete clinical trials. The FDA typically requires at least two pivotal, well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials as a condition to the submission of an NDA or BLA and does not usually consider a single Phase 3 clinical trial to be adequate to support product approval. The FDA will typically only consider relying on one pivotal trial if, in addition, other well-controlled studies of the drug exist (for example, for other dosage forms or in other populations) or if the pivotal trial is a multi-center trial that provides highly reliable and statistically strong evidence of an important clinical benefit, and a confirmatory study would have been difficult to conduct on ethical grounds.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe FDA approved Oxbryta for the treatment of SCD under the accelerated approval pathway under Subpart H, and approval under this accelerated pathway means that we are required to conduct at least one post-marketing confirmatory study sufficient to verify Oxbryta\u2019s clinical benefit, which we intend to satisfy through our HOPE-KIDS 2 Study. With respect to Europe, the EC granted marketing authorization for Oxbryta for the treatment of hemolytic anemia due to SCD following a positive opinion by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP. Following such positive opinion by the CHMP, we submitted an application to the MHRA for a Great Britain Marketing Authorisation using the EC Decision Reliance Procedure, and, despite such positive opinion and the EU approval, there is no guarantee as to if or when the MHRA will authorize marketing approval of Oxbryta in the UK.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nForeign authorities may not consider the results of our ongoing, planned or potential future clinical trials of Oxbryta to be sufficient to obtain or maintain any regulatory and/or pricing or reimbursement approvals outside of the United States. For example, Oxbryta may not be approved for marketing in the UK. Any post-marketing confirmatory studies, if required, would result in increased costs and potential delays in the clinical development and marketing approval process outside the United States, which may require us to expend more resources than are available to us. In addition, it is possible that the FDA and the comparable foreign authorities may have divergent opinions on the elements necessary for a successful NDA or other application for marketing authorization, as applicable, which may cause us to alter our development, regulatory and/or commercialization strategies.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may encounter substantial delays in conducting or completing our clinical trials, which in turn will result in additional costs and may ultimately prevent successful or timely completion of the clinical development and commercialization of Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 or any other product candidates we may identify and pursue.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBefore obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any our product candidates, we must conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidates in humans. In addition, because the FDA approved Oxbryta under the accelerated approval pathway under Subpart H, we must conduct at least one post-marketing confirmatory study to verify clinical risk/benefit, which we intend to satisfy through our HOPE-KIDS 2 Study. Clinical testing is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain as to outcome, and we cannot guarantee that any of our current or future clinical trials for Oxbryta or any other product candidates we may pursue will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. For example, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily paused all site activation, screening and enrollment activities for our HOPE-KIDS 2 Study (other than, where feasible, contracting and other administrative study start-up activities). Activities on our clinical trials have resumed, with measures in place that we believe are appropriate. While we have resumed clinical trial activities, we have continued to see a negative impact on enrollment and certain other aspects of our clinical trials that we believe are related to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, and we do not know with any certainty the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our clinical development activities. In addition, it is unknown whether we will be required to pause or delay our clinical trial activities again in the future.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n56\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. Events that may prevent successful or timely completion of clinical development include:\n \n\n\n\u2022\ndelays or failures in reaching a consensus with regulatory agencies on study design, including clinical endpoints sufficient to support an approval decision; \n\n\n\u2022\ndelays or failures to receive approval to conduct clinical studies in one or more geographies, which could result in delays in enrollment and availability of data and results; \n\n\n\u2022\ndelays or failures in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with a sufficient number of prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites; \n\n\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining required Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee approval for each clinical trial site; \n\n\n\u2022\ndelays in recruiting a sufficient number of suitable patients to participate in our clinical trials, which could be due to, among other things, competition for such patients as a result of other clinical trials we are conducting, as well as sickle cell-related clinical trials of other entities, that target the same or similar patient populations; \n\n\n\u2022\nimposition of a clinical hold by any regulatory authority, including if imposed due to safety concerns after an inspection of our clinical trial operations or study sites; \n\n\n\u2022\nfailure by our CROs, clinical sites, participating clinicians or patients, other third parties or us to adhere to clinical trial, regulatory or legal requirements; \n\n\n\u2022\nfailure to perform in accordance with the FDA\u2019s good clinical practices, or GCPs, or applicable regulatory requirements in other countries; \n\n\n\u2022\ndelays in the testing, validation, manufacturing and delivery of sufficient quantities of Oxbryta or our product candidates or study related devices to the clinical sites and patients; \n\n\n\u2022\ndelays in having patients enroll or complete participation in a study in accordance with applicable protocols or protocol amendments or return for post-treatment follow-up; \n\n\n\u2022\nreduction in the number of participating clinical trial sites or patients, including by dropping out of a trial; \n\n\n\u2022\nfailure to address in an adequate or timely manner any patient safety concerns that arise during the course of a trial; \n\n\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs or increases in costs of clinical trials of Oxbryta or our product candidates; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of serious adverse events or other safety concerns associated with Oxbryta or our product candidates; or \n\n\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols or obtaining additional IRB or other approvals to conduct or complete clinical studies of Oxbryta or our product candidates. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated for any reason (which could occur as a result of termination by us, by the IRBs or ethics committees of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, by an independent Safety Review Board for such trial, or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities). A clinical trial can be suspended or terminated for a wide variety of reasons, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by us, or the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, or failure to demonstrate a benefit from using Oxbryta or a drug candidate. In addition, if we make manufacturing or formulation changes to Oxbryta or our product candidates, we may need to conduct additional studies to bridge the development program from the data and results for the previous version to the modified version.\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nClinical trial delays could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize a drug or product candidate or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize Oxbryta and our product candidates. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our drug development and approval process or jeopardize our ability to maintain our current FDA approval of Oxbryta (or to achieve full FDA approval or additional product approvals outside of the United States), and jeopardize our ability to continue or commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n57\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDifficulty in enrolling patients or maintaining compliance with dosing or other requirements in our clinical trials could delay or prevent clinical trials of Oxbryta or our product candidates, which in turn could delay or prevent our ability to obtain or maintain the regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize Oxbryta and our product candidates.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIdentifying and qualifying patients to participate in our ongoing and planned clinical trials of Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 and any other product candidates that we may develop are critical to our success. Our clinical development efforts are initially focused on rare chronic blood diseases. For example, according to estimates by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the prevalence of SCD, for which Oxbryta is indicated, is approximately 100,000 individuals in the United States. Accordingly, there are limited patient pools from which to draw for clinical trials in our target indications. We may not be able to identify, recruit, and enroll a sufficient number of subjects to complete our clinical trials because of the perceived risks and benefits of the study drug, the availability of competing therapies, the competition for such subjects as a result of other clinical trials we are conducting, as well as sickle cell-related clinical trials of other entities, that target the same or similar patient populations, the proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective subjects, the availability and willingness of patients to participate in clinical trials and the subject referral practices of physicians, among other factors.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFurther, if subjects in our clinical trials fail to comply with our dosing regimens or other requirements in our clinical trials, we may not be able to generate clinical data acceptable to the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities in our trials. For example, successful conduct of our HOPE-KIDS 2 Study (our post-approval confirmatory study) will require consistency in TCD measurements, which is why we are providing specific training and equipment to participating clinical trial sites in such clinical trial. Failure to achieve consistent high-quality readings could result in data that are difficult to interpret or that delay or confound the results. If clinical sites or patients are unwilling or unable to participate in, complete or comply with the protocols for our studies for any reason, the timeline for recruiting subjects, conducting studies and obtaining regulatory approval of potential products may be delayed.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we experience difficulties or delays in enrollment or are otherwise unable to successfully complete any clinical trial of Oxbryta, or any other product candidates we may pursue, our costs are likely to increase, and our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval (or achieve full regulatory approval of Oxbryta) and generate product revenue from Oxbryta and any of these product candidates will be impaired. Any of these occurrences would harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nIf serious adverse events or unacceptable side effects are identified during the development of Oxbryta or our product candidates, we may need to delay, limit or terminate our clinical development activities.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nClinical trials by their nature utilize only a small sample of the potential patient population. For example, our Phase 3 HOPE Study in SCD patients represents only a very small fraction of all patients with SCD. Side effects of Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 or any other product candidates that we may develop may be uncovered only in later stages of clinical trials, or only in trials involving different patient populations (such as pediatric patients), or only during post-approval studies, such as our HOPE-KIDS 2 Study (our TCD confirmatory study), or the safety reporting required for approved products. Many approved drugs and product candidates that initially showed promise in early stage testing have later been found to cause side effects that prevented their further development. Moreover, a nonclinical toxicology study with Oxbryta in non-humans and clinical trials involving other hemoglobin modifiers (other than Oxbryta) have shown a decrease in oxygen delivery to tissue when a significant percentage of hemoglobin is modified. Hemoglobin modifiers, by increasing HbS\u2019s affinity for oxygen, can cause a shift in oxygen levels, potentially resulting in tissue hypoxia. To date, clinical studies of Oxbryta have not shown evidence of tissue hypoxia. However, if Oxbryta or any other product candidates that we may develop are associated with tissue hypoxia or any other undesirable side effects or unexpected undesirable characteristics in clinical trials or nonclinical studies, we may need to abandon their development or limit their development to more narrow uses or subpopulations, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, with respect to Oxbryta, such a result may also significantly impact or require us to terminate our commercial sales of Oxbryta.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough the FDA and the European Commission have each granted orphan drug designation for Oxbryta for the potential treatment of SCD, we may not receive orphan drug designation for inclacumab, GBT601 or any other product candidates for which we may submit new applications for orphan drug designation, and any orphan drug designations that we have received or may receive in the future may not confer marketing exclusivity or other expected commercial benefits.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur business strategy focuses on the development of product candidates for the treatment of rare, chronic blood disorders that may be eligible for FDA or EU orphan drug designation. Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and the EU, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. In 2015 and 2016, respectively, the FDA and the EC (acting on a positive recommendation by the EMA) each granted orphan drug designation for Oxbryta for the treatment of patients\n \n\n\n58\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nwith SCD. \n\u00a0\n\n\nGenerally, if a product candidate with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA or the EMA from approving another marketing application for the same product for the same indication for that time period. The applicable period is seven years in the United States and 10 years in the EU. The EU exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation or if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or EMA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. \n\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough the FDA and the EMA have each granted orphan drug designation to Oxbryta for the treatment of SCD, we may apply for orphan drug designation for Oxbryta in other jurisdictions or for other indications, or for inclacumab, GBT601 or other product candidates we may develop and pursue in the future. Applicable regulatory authorities may not grant us these additional designations. In addition, the exclusivity granted under any orphan drug designations that we have received from the FDA and the EMA, or may receive from any other regulatory authorities (if any), may not effectively protect Oxbryta or any other product candidate we pursue from competition because different products can be approved for the same condition. For example, in the United States, even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve another product for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later product is clinically superior, or the FDA can approve a competitor application for the same product for a different indication than the orphan drug designation. In addition, legislators or regulators may reevaluate and elect to modify orphan drug exclusivity laws or regulations in ways that could materially impact existing or future orphan drug designations. We do not know if, when, or how such authorities may change their orphan drug regulations and policies in the future, and it is uncertain how any changes may affect our business. Any inability to secure or maintain orphan drug designation or the exclusivity benefits of this designation would have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. In addition, even if any orphan drug designations we receive are maintained, we may be unable to realize significant commercial benefits from these regulatory exclusivities for Oxbryta or any other product candidate we pursue.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe rely, and will continue to rely, on third parties to conduct some of our nonclinical studies and all of our clinical trials and also to perform other tasks for us. If these third parties perform in an unsatisfactory manner, it may harm our business.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon third-party CROs, including our CROs for our clinical trials of Oxbryta, to monitor and manage data for some of our ongoing nonclinical studies and for all of our clinical programs. We rely on these parties for execution of these nonclinical studies and clinical trials, and control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies and trials are conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory, and scientific standards and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs and other vendors are required to comply with all applicable cGMPs, GCPs, and current good laboratory practices, or GLPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area, or EEA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Regulatory authorities enforce these regulations through periodic inspections of study sponsors, principal investigators, study sites, manufacturing facilities, nonclinical testing facilities and other contractors. If we or any of our CROs or other vendors fail to comply with applicable regulations, the data generated in our nonclinical studies and clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the applicable regulatory authorities may suspend regulatory approval or require us to repeat or to perform additional nonclinical and clinical studies before approving our marketing applications, which would delay the regulatory review and approval process, perhaps significantly.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, the execution of nonclinical studies and clinical trials, the subsequent compilation and analysis of the data and results produced, and the supply of product for our trials and commercialization, requires coordination among various parties. In order for these functions to be carried out effectively and efficiently, it is imperative that these parties communicate and coordinate with one another. These third parties may terminate their agreements with us upon short notice for our uncured material breach, or under certain other circumstances. If any of our relationships with our third-party CROs or other key vendors (including manufacturing and testing facilities) terminates, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or other key vendors on a timely basis or at all, or do so on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, our CROs and other key vendors are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with them, we cannot control whether they devote sufficient time and resources to our programs. Furthermore, these third-party CROs or other key vendors may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If CROs or other key vendors do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data and results they obtain or the product they supply is compromised for any reason (including failure to adhere to our protocols, or regulatory requirements), our development activities may be extended, delayed, or terminated and we may not be able to seek, obtain or maintain regulatory approval for or\n \n\n\n59\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nsuccessfully commercialize Oxbryta or any of our product candidates. Switching or adding CROs or any other key vendors involves additional cost, time and management resources and focus. In addition, our CROs or other key vendors may also generate higher costs than anticipated.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, in connection with any marketing application for our product candidates, pre-approval inspections by a regulatory agency of our facilities and/or those of third parties involved in the drug development program may occur, including at clinical trial sites, CMOs or other third parties on which we are very reliant. Significant negative results from pre-approval inspections, if any, could materially delay potential approval of the drug candidate. Accordingly, our dependence on third-party CROs, other key vendors and other third parties may subject us to challenges, delays and costs that have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe do or will rely entirely on third parties for the manufacture of Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 and any other product candidates we may pursue for nonclinical studies and clinical trials, and we expect to continue to do so for the commercial supply of Oxbryta and for any other product commercialization we may conduct. Our business could be harmed if any of those third parties fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of drug product, or fail to do so at acceptable quality or quantity levels or prices.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe do not currently have, nor do we plan to acquire, the infrastructure or capability internally to manufacture drug supplies for our commercial sales of Oxbryta and for any clinical trials we are conducting or may conduct for Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 or any other product candidates, and we do not presently expect that we will establish or acquire the resources necessary to manufacture Oxbryta or any of our product candidates on a commercial scale. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, wholly on third-party manufacturers to produce our product candidates for our clinical trials, as well as for commercial manufacture or any required post-marketing studies of Oxbryta, and we expect to do the same with respect to any other product candidates, if any, that receives marketing approval. If any manufacturer with whom we contract fails to perform its obligations, we may be forced to manufacture the materials ourselves, for which do not currently have or anticipate developing the requisite capabilities or resources, or enter into an agreement with one or more different manufacturers, which we may not be able to do on reasonable terms and timelines, if at all. Although we generally do not begin a clinical trial unless we believe we have a sufficient supply of a product candidate to complete the trial, any significant delay or discontinuity in the supply of a product candidate, or the raw material components thereof, for an ongoing clinical trial due to, among other possible reasons, the need to replace a third-party manufacturer could considerably delay the clinical development and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates, which could harm our business and results of operations. We expect to rely on multiple third parties for the manufacture of commercial supplies of Oxbryta as well as for inclacumab, GBT601 or any other product candidates, if approved.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may be unable to establish or maintain any agreements with third-party manufacturers for Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 or any other product candidates, or to do so on acceptable terms. Even if we are able to establish or maintain agreements with third-party manufacturers for Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 or any other product candidates, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including:\n \n\n\n\u2022\nreliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance; \n\n\n\u2022\npossible breach or termination of the manufacturing agreement by the third party or by us, including at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe inability of the third party to satisfy our ordering requirements as to quality, quantity and/or price, including, without limitation, potential impact on supply chain due to natural disasters, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism, and political unrest (such as the current Ukrainian crisis with Russia), public health risks (such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), protests (such as the current Canadian trucker protest), boycotts, curtailment of trade, and other business interruptions and restrictions; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how; and \n\n\n\u2022\nthe unwillingness of the third party to extend or renew terms with us when desired. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur reliance on third-party manufacturers in connection with inclacumab entails additional potential risks, including due to us having less experience manufacturing a biologic product than we do for an oral drug. As such, we will have greater reliance on the expertise and experience of our third-party manufacturer for inclacumab.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFurthermore, all of our contract manufacturers are engaged with other companies to supply and/or manufacture materials or products for such companies, which exposes our manufacturers to regulatory and market risks for the production of such third-party materials and products. As a result, failure to meet the regulatory requirements for the production of those materials and products may affect the regulatory assessment or clearance of our contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities generally, and industry consolidation, pricing or other market factors may cause our contract manufacturers to scale back, terminate or refuse to renew desired arrangements for our\n \n\n\n60\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nmaterials. Any of these factors could negatively impact our ability to commercialize Oxbryta or develop, obtain additional regulatory approval for or further market, as applicable, Oxbryta or our product candidates, if approved.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 and any other product candidates that we may identify and pursue may compete with other product candidates and marketed drugs for access to manufacturing facilities. Any performance failure on the part of our existing or future manufacturers could delay or impair clinical development, marketing approval or commercialization. Although we believe we have adequate supplies to commercialize Oxbryta and conduct our ongoing clinical trials, if we are unable to enter into relationships with additional contract manufacturers, or our current or future contract manufacturers cannot perform as agreed, we may experience delays and incur additional costs in our continued commercialization and clinical development activities. Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of Oxbryta, our product candidates and any other marketed drugs may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize Oxbryta or any other product candidates that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf the contract manufacturing facilities on which we rely do not continue to meet regulatory requirements or are unable to meet our supply demands, our business will be harmed.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAll entities involved in the preparation of therapeutics for clinical trials or commercial sale, including our existing contract manufacturers for Oxbryta and for our product candidates, are subject to extensive regulation. Components of a finished therapeutic product approved for commercial sale or used in late-stage clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMPs, or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. These regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures, including recordkeeping, and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of investigational products and products approved for sale. Poor control of production processes can lead to the introduction of contaminants or to inadvertent changes in the properties or stability of Oxbryta or our product candidates. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, suspension of production, seizures or voluntary recalls of product candidates or marketed drugs, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect clinical or commercial supplies of Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 or any of our other product candidates.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nAmong other requirements, we or our contract manufacturers must supply all necessary documentation in support of a marketing application seeking approval of a product candidate on a timely basis and must adhere to GLP and cGMP regulations enforced by the FDA and other regulatory agencies through their facilities inspection programs. The facilities and quality systems of some or all of our third-party contractors must pass a pre-approval inspection for compliance with the applicable regulations as a condition of regulatory approval for Oxbryta. In addition, the regulatory authorities may, at any time, audit or inspect a manufacturing facility involved with the preparation of Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 or any of our other product candidates or the associated quality systems. Although we oversee the contract manufacturers, we cannot control the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with these complex regulatory requirements. If these manufacturers, facilities, records or systems do not pass pre-approval inspections and reviews, additional regulatory approval of Oxbryta or regulatory approval of inclacumab, GBT601 or any of our other product candidates may never be granted or may be substantially delayed.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, at any time following approval of a product for sale, the regulatory authorities also may audit the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contractors. If any such inspection or audit identifies a failure to comply with applicable regulations or if a violation of our product specifications or applicable regulations occurs independent of such an inspection or audit, we or the relevant regulatory authority may require remedial measures that could be costly or time consuming for us or a third party to implement, and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical study or commercial sales or the temporary or permanent closure of a facility. Any such remedial measures imposed upon us or third parties with whom we contract could materially harm our business.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, if supply from one approved manufacturer is interrupted, an alternative manufacturer would need to be qualified through a supplement to a marketing application, which would result in further delay, uncertainty and costs. If this occurs, our commercial distribution or clinical trials could be delayed significantly as we establish alternative supply sources. In some cases, the technical skills required to manufacture our products or product candidates may be proprietary to the original manufacturer and we may have contractual restrictions or other challenges in seeking to transfer such skills to a back-up or alternate supplier. In addition to verifying that any new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations, we would also need to verify, such as through a manufacturing comparability study, that any new manufacturing process will produce our product or product candidate according to the specifications previously submitted to or approved by the FDA or another regulatory authority. The delays and costs associated with the verification of a new manufacturer could negatively affect our ability to develop product candidates or commercialize our products in a timely manner or within budget.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n61\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, changes in manufacturers often involve changes in manufacturing procedures and processes, which, in the case of the manufacturers that supply our product candidates, could require that we conduct bridging studies between our prior clinical supply used in our clinical trials and that of any new manufacturer. We may be unsuccessful in demonstrating the comparability of clinical supplies, which could require the conduct of additional clinical trials and result in the suspension of or delays in our commercialization activities and clinical development plans. Any of these factors could cause us to incur higher costs and could cause the delay or termination of clinical trials, regulatory submissions, required approvals, or commercialization of Oxbryta or our product candidates. Furthermore, if our suppliers fail to meet contractual requirements and we are unable to secure one or more replacement suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, our clinical trials may be delayed or we could lose potential revenue.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur reliance on third parties requires us to share our trade secrets and confidential information, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our critical information will be misappropriated or disclosed.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBecause we do or will rely on third parties to manufacture Oxbryta and to conduct other aspects of our clinical development activities, as well as for inclacumab, GBT601 and any other product candidates we may pursue, we must, at times, share trade secrets with them. We seek to protect our proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, other forms of agreement with any collaborators, CROs, manufacturers and consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information. Despite the contractual provisions employed when working with third parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets and confidential information may become known by our competitors, may inadvertently be incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on our know-how and trade secrets, a competitor\u2019s discovery of our trade secrets or confidential information, or other unauthorized use or disclosure would impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur agreements typically restrict the ability of certain collaborators, CROs, manufacturers, other key vendors and consultants to publish data, although many of our contracts provide for the right to publish data in specified circumstances. A significant breach of these publication provisions could impair our competitive position. In addition, we conduct joint research and development programs that may require us to share trade secrets and other confidential information. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and confidential information, our competitors may discover them, either through breach of agreements relating to these programs, independent development or publication of information where we do not have proprietary or otherwise protected rights at the time of publication. A competitor\u2019s discovery of our trade secrets or confidential information would impair our competitive position and have an adverse impact on our business.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we or our licensors are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient intellectual property protection for Oxbryta or our product candidates, or if the scope of the intellectual property protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize product candidates similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 and other product candidates that we may pursue may be impaired. Changes in patent policy and rules could impair our ability to protect our products and increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain protection of the intellectual property, particularly patents, that we may exclusively license or own solely and jointly with others in the United States and other countries with respect to Oxbryta and our product candidates and technology, including inclacumab and GBT601. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to Oxbryta and our product candidates and technology.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nObtaining and enforcing biopharmaceutical patents is costly, time consuming, uncertain and complex, and we or our licensors may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications, or maintain, enforce and license any patents that may issue from such patent applications, at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. We may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the rights to patents licensed to or from third parties. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If our current or future licensors, licensees or collaboration partners fail to establish, maintain or protect such patents and other intellectual property rights, such rights may be reduced or eliminated. If our licensors, licensees or collaboration partners are not fully cooperative or disagree with us as to the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of any patent rights, such patent rights could be compromised.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n62\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal, technological and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, or vice versa. Further, we may not be aware of all third-party intellectual property rights potentially relating to Oxbryta or our product candidates. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing or, in some cases, not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are and will remain highly uncertain. The patent examination process may require us or our licensors, licensees or collaboration partners to narrow the scope of the claims of our or our licensors\u2019, licensees\u2019 or collaboration partners\u2019 pending and future patent applications, which may limit the scope of patent protection that may be obtained. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued that protect Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 or any other product candidates, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive product candidates. Even if our patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative product candidates in a non-infringing manner, or by successfully seeking to narrow or invalidate our patents or render them unenforceable. Our and our licensors\u2019, licensees\u2019 or collaboration partners\u2019 patent applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from such applications, and then only to the extent the issued claims cover the technology.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe cannot assure you that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found. If such prior art exists, it can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application. Moreover, we may be subject to a third-party preissuance submission of prior art to the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize Oxbryta or our product candidates and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize drugs without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 or any other product candidates.\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical product candidates, or limit the duration of the patent protection of Oxbryta or our product candidates.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGiven the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing drugs similar or identical to ours.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe United States has enacted patent reform legislation from time to time and the United States Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents once obtained. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would diminish the value of our patents and patent applications or narrow the scope of our patent protection, or weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAssuming the other requirements for patentability are met, in the United States prior to March 15, 2013, the first to make the claimed invention is entitled to the patent, while outside the United States, the first-to-file a patent application is entitled to the patent. After March 2013, under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or AIA, enacted in 2011, the United States has moved to a first-to-file system similar to other countries\u2019 systems. The AIA also includes a number of significant changes that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, and may also affect patent litigation. Any further changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents and patent applications or narrow the scope of our potential patent protection.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur products and product candidates may be eligible for various regulatory exclusivities for varying periods in varying jurisdictions. For example, we expect inclacumab, if approved, would be eligible for regulatory exclusivities, including data\n \n\n\n63\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nexclusivity for biologics and orphan drug exclusivity, in various jurisdictions such as the U.S. and Europe, which exclusivities may extend beyond inclacumab patent expiry. Both the United States and the EU provide pathways for biologics competitors to seek approval for biosimilar products at the end of the relevant exclusivity period or, in some circumstances, before such period expires (for example, if a biosimilar applicant obtains approval for one or more of the indications approved for the innovator product by extrapolating clinical data from one indication to support approval for other indications). As a result, the available forms of exclusivity may not provide us with sufficient protections to exclude others from commercializing drugs similar or identical to ours.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may become subject to claims alleging infringement of third parties\u2019 patents or proprietary rights and/or claims seeking to invalidate our patents, which would be costly, time consuming and, if successfully asserted against us, delay or prevent the development and commercialization of Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 or any other product candidates that we may develop.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe cannot assure that Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 or any other product candidates that we may develop will not infringe existing or future third-party patents. Because patent applications can take many years to issue and may be confidential for 18 months or more after filing, there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware and which may later result in issued patents that we may infringe by commercializing Oxbryta or any product candidates that we may develop. We may additionally be unaware of one or more issued patents that would be infringed by the manufacture, sale or use of Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 or any of our other product candidates.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may in the future become party to, or be threatened with, adversarial proceedings or litigation against us regarding third party intellectual property rights with respect to Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 or any other product candidates, that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to be willfully infringing a third party\u2019s patents. We may also be required to indemnify parties with whom we have contractual relationships against such claims. If a patent infringement suit were brought against us, we could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit. As a result of patent infringement claims, or to avoid potential claims, we may choose to seek, or be required to seek, a license from the third party to continue developing, manufacturing and marketing Oxbryta and our product candidates and would most likely be required to pay license fees or royalties or both, that could be significant. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property licensed to us. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or forced to redesign it, or to cease some aspect of our business operations if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, such litigation can be expensive, uncertain, and time consuming to litigate, and would divert management\u2019s attention from our core business. Any of these events could harm our business significantly.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition to infringement claims against us, if third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology similar or identical to ours, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine which party is entitled to a patent on the disputed invention. We may also become involved in post grant or inter partes reviews in the USPTO, opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office, or similar proceedings in patent offices in other jurisdictions regarding our intellectual property rights with respect to Oxbryta and our product candidates and technology.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCompetitors or other parties may infringe our patents or other intellectual property. Although we are not currently involved in any intellectual property litigation, if we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering Oxbryta or one of our product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering Oxbryta or our product candidate is invalid and/or unenforceable. In addition, there is an abbreviated regulatory pathway, under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, for the regulatory approval of biosimilar or interchangeable biologic products, which could create a litigation pathway for a third party to challenge patents covering inclacumab. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace, and there are multiple potential grounds for a validity challenge or an unenforceability assertion. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is often highly unpredictable. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, our defense of litigation may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations including our ability to commercialize Oxbryta, raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our research programs, license necessary technology from third parties, or enter into development partnerships that would help us bring Oxbryta and our product candidates to domestic and foreign markets.\n \n\n\n64\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may become subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in our patents or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. For example, inventorship disputes may arise from conflicting obligations of third parties involved in developing our product candidates or as a result of questions regarding co-ownership of potential joint inventions. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership or we may enter into agreements to clarify the scope of our rights in such intellectual property. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations including our ability to raise the funds necessary to commercialize Oxbryta, continue our clinical trials, continue our research programs, license necessary technology from third parties, or enter into development partnerships that would help us bring our product candidates to market. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe jointly own patents and patent applications with third parties. Our ability to exploit or enforce these patent rights, or to prevent the third party from granting licenses to others with respect to these patent rights, may be limited in some circumstances.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe jointly own certain patents and patent applications with third parties. In the absence of an agreement with each co-owner of jointly owned patent rights, we will be subject to default rules pertaining to joint ownership. Some countries require the consent of all joint owners to exploit, license or assign jointly owned patents, and if we are unable to obtain that consent from the joint owners, we may be unable to exploit the invention or to license or assign our rights under these patents and patent applications in those countries. For example, we have exclusively licensed from the Regents of the University of California, or Regents, worldwide patent rights covering Oxbryta and certain Oxbryta analogs, some of which patent rights we jointly own with the Regents. Additionally, in the United States, each co-owner may be required to be joined as a party to any claim or action we may wish to bring to enforce these patent rights, which may limit our ability to pursue third party infringement claims.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties or that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe employ individuals who were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants and independent contractors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any of our employees\u2019 former employers or other third parties. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, which could adversely impact our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets or other confidential information, the value of our technology could be materially adversely affected and our business would be harmed.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe seek to protect our confidential proprietary information, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and collaborators. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information. However, we cannot be certain that such agreements have been entered into with all relevant parties, and we cannot be certain that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. For example, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our confidential proprietary information by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems, but it is possible that these security measures could be breached. Enforcing a claim that a third party obtained illegally and is using trade secrets or confidential know-how is expensive, time consuming and unpredictable. The enforceability of confidentiality agreements may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. If any of our confidential\n \n\n\n65\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nproprietary information were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent such competitor from using that technology or information to compete with us, which could harm our competitive position. Additionally, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we may have insufficient recourse against third parties for misappropriating the trade secret.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFailure to obtain or maintain trade secrets or confidential know-how trade protection could adversely affect our competitive position. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and may even apply for patent protection in respect of the same. If successful in obtaining such patent protection, our competitors could limit our use of our trade secrets or confidential know-how.\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various governmental patent agencies outside of the United States in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications. We employ outside firms and rely on them to pay many of these fees. The USPTO and various non- U.S. governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of complex procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market, with a material adverse effect on our business.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on Oxbryta and our product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries worldwide, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and may also export infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but patent enforcement is not strong. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights throughout the world. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nChanges in patent laws or patent jurisprudence could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involve both technological complexity and legal complexity. Therefore, obtaining and enforcing biopharmaceutical patents is costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the AIA has been recently enacted in the United States, resulting in significant changes to the U.S. patent system.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAn important change introduced by the AIA is that, as of March 16, 2013, the United States transitioned to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after that date but before us could, therefore, be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by the third party. This will\n \n\n\n66\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nrequire us to be cognizant going forward of the time from invention to filing of a patent application, but circumstances could prevent us from promptly filing patent applications on our inventions.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAmong some of the other changes introduced by the AIA are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and provide opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO. This applies to all of our U.S. patents, even those issued before March 16, 2013. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in United States federal courts necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action. The AIA and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nThe USPTO recently has developed regulations and procedures to govern administration of the AIA, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the AIA, and, in particular, the first to file provisions, only became effective in March 2013. Accordingly, the courts have yet to address many of these provisions and it is not clear what, if any, impact the AIA will have on the operation of our business. The AIA and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our or our licensors\u2019 or collaboration partners\u2019 patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our or our licensors\u2019 or collaboration partners\u2019 issued patents, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this has also contributed to uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that could weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. Similarly, the complexity and uncertainty of European patent laws has also increased in recent years. In addition, the European patent system is relatively stringent in the type of amendments that are allowed during prosecution. These changes could limit our ability to obtain new patents in the future that may be important for our business.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPandemics such as the one caused by the novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, as well as similar outbreaks and other public health crises, could adversely impact our business, including our commercialization activities, clinical trials and preclinical studies.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPandemics, similar outbreaks and other public health crises could adversely impact our business. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted people and entities throughout the world. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced and may continue to experience disruptions that could materially impact our business. The extent to which this pandemic or other health crises, or changes in laws and regulations such as shelter-in-place orders, impact our business and operating results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 and the actions taken to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, various aspects of our business operations have been, and could continue to be, disrupted. In response to the pandemic, we implemented a work from home policy, with our administrative and certain other employees continuing their work outside of our offices, and restricted on-site staff to only a limited number of employees who have critical needs to be in the facility. The increase in working remotely could increase our cyber security risk, create data accessibility concerns, and make us more susceptible to communication disruptions, any of which could adversely impact our business operations or delay necessary interactions with local and federal regulators, ethics committees, manufacturing sites and clinical trial sites. In addition, as a result of shelter-in-place orders or other mandated travel restrictions, staff conducting on-site research and development may have limited access to our laboratory space, and these core activities may be significantly limited or curtailed, possibly for an extended period of time.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also reduced the ability to engage with the medical and investor communities, including due to the cancellation or reformatting of conferences. For example, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily suspended our field team from most in-person interactions, including visits to physician offices, clinics and hospitals as well as in-person meetings with payors. While we have more recently increased our face-to-face engagements and are continuing to engage with healthcare professionals and payors through digital and internet-based education and outreach, the impact of utilizing less in-person interactions is unknown, although we believe this may have impacted new patients prescriptions for Oxbryta. These and other measures may significantly impact our ability to commercialize Oxbryta, such as by continuing to limit new patient enrollments.\n \n\n\n67\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, our ongoing and planned clinical trials have been and will likely continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily paused screening and enrollment in all GBT-sponsored clinical trials (other than, where feasible, certain contracting and other administrative study start-up activities). Activities on our clinical trials have resumed, with measures in place that we believe are appropriate. While we have resumed clinical trial activities, we have continued to see a negative impact on enrollment and certain other aspects of our clinical trials that we believe are related to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, and we do not know with any certainty the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our clinical development activities. In addition, it is unknown whether we will be required to pause or delay such activities again in the future. Any prolongation or de-prioritization of our clinical trials or delay in regulatory review resulting from such disruptions could materially affect the development and study of Oxbryta or our product candidates. Study procedures (particularly any procedures that may be deemed non-essential), site initiation, participant recruitment and enrollment, participant dosing, shipment of our study compound, distribution of clinical trial materials, study monitoring, site inspections and data analysis may be delayed or paused due to changes in hospital or research institution policies, federal, state or local regulations, prioritization of hospital and other medical resources toward pandemic efforts, or other reasons related to the pandemic. Depending in part on the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, some participants and clinical investigators may not be able to comply with clinical trial protocols and we may experience increased patient study withdrawals or protocol deviations. For example, this may occur if quarantines or other travel limitations (whether voluntary or required) impede participant movement, affect access to study sites, or interrupt healthcare services for a prolonged period of time. As a result, we may be unable to conduct our clinical trials.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFurthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in, and could continue to cause, interruptions or delays in the operations of the FDA and other domestic or foreign regulatory agencies, which could impact the conduct of our clinical trials, the ability to seek agency input on our regulatory strategies and potential filings or interactions with regulatory agencies that oversee our research, development and promotional activities. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic led the FDA to place some foreign and domestic inspections on hold. In April 2021, the FDA issued guidance for industry formally announcing plans to employ remote interactive evaluations, using risk management methods, to meet user fee commitments and goal dates. The FDA has developed a rating system to assist in determining when and where it is safest to conduct prioritized domestic inspections, and in July 2021, the FDA began the gradual transition into standard operational levels for domestic surveillance inspections. In November 2021, the FDA announced that it is developing a plan for resuming prioritized foreign inspections, including surveillance and application-related inspections, starting in February 2022. Ongoing travel restrictions and other uncertainties continue to impact oversight operations. The FDA is continuing to complete mission-critical work, prioritize other higher-tiered inspectional needs (e.g., for-cause inspections), and carry out surveillance inspections using risk-based approaches for evaluating public health. Should the FDA determine that an inspection is necessary for approval of a marketing application and an inspection cannot be completed during the review cycle due to restrictions on travel, and the FDA identifies concerns about the adequacy of a facility or site or there is insufficient information currently available to make a determination on the acceptability of a facility or site and other deficiencies have been identified, the FDA has stated that it generally intends to issue a complete response letter with or without site-related deficiencies, respectively. Additionally, if there is insufficient information to make a determination on the acceptability of a facility and other deficiencies have not been identified, the FDA may defer action on the application until an inspection can be completed. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of companies announced receipt of complete response letters due to the FDA\u2019s inability to complete required inspections for their applications. Regulatory authorities outside the United States may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and may also experience delays in their regulatory activities. The extent and impact of such any such disruptions or delays are currently unpredictable.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur and our vendors\u2019 and collaborators\u2019 research, preclinical development, and manufacturing operations also may be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We currently utilize third parties to, among other things, supply and manufacture raw materials, components, and Oxbryta and our product candidates, to ship Oxbryta and our product candidates and manufacturing materials, and to perform certain testing relating to Oxbryta and our product candidates, including clinical studies and stability testing. If we, or any third parties in our supply chain for materials which are used in either the manufacture of Oxbryta or our product candidates or the conduct of our research and development, are adversely impacted by restrictions resulting from the coronavirus outbreak, our supply chain may be disrupted and our ability to manufacture and ship Oxbryta and our product candidates for commercial and research and development activities may be limited. In particular, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA has granted Emergency Use Authorization to three vaccines for COVID-19, and two of those later received marketing approval. Additional vaccines may be authorized or approved in the future. The resultant demand for vaccines and potential for manufacturing facilities and materials to be commandeered under the Defense Production Act of 1950, or equivalent foreign legislation, may make it more difficult to obtain materials or manufacturing slots for the supply needed to support the commercialization of Oxbryta or the development of our product candidates.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, the trading prices for our common stock and other biopharmaceutical companies have been highly volatile as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we may face difficulties raising capital through equity or debt financings, or such financing transactions may be on unfavorable terms. While the potential economic impact brought by and the duration of the\n \n\n\n68\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\npandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, it has already caused, and is likely to result in further, significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce our ability to access capital either at all or on favorable terms. Furthermore, a recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or any other health epidemic, is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our commercialization activities, our clinical and preclinical programs, our clinical, preclinical, research, manufacturing, and regulatory activities, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, these effects could have a material adverse impact on our operations, and we will continue to monitor the situation closely.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key employees, consultants and advisors and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are highly dependent on the management, commercial, research and development, clinical, financial and business development expertise of our executive officers, as well as the other members of our team. Although we have employment offer letters with each of our executive officers, each of them may terminate their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance for any of our executives or employees.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific, medical, clinical, technical operations personnel and sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success. The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Furthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidates. Competition to hire qualified personnel in our industry and geographic market is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. Such efforts have become, and may continue to be, more challenging since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we may experience similar challenges in the future due to other outbreaks or other significant business disruptions. Furthermore, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information, or that their former employers own their research output. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, our ability to pursue our growth strategy will be limited.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have implemented and expect to continue to refine our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and expect to expand our product development capabilities, and, as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWith the establishment of infrastructure required for commercialization of Oxbryta and our current and planned product development activities, we have experienced significant and rapid growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of sales, marketing and distribution, regulatory affairs, research and drug development, and we expect to further expand our infrastructure with the recent approval of Oxbryta in the EU. To manage this and future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited financial resources, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel. The expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage our recent or future growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we are not successful in discovering, developing, acquiring or commercializing additional product candidates, our ability to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives could be impaired.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough a substantial amount of our effort will focus on the continued commercialization, clinical testing and seeking of additional regulatory approval of Oxbryta, a key element of our strategy is to pursue, develop and commercialize a portfolio of products utilizing proprietary discovery and development technology. We are seeking to do so through our internal research programs and may also selectively pursue commercially synergistic in-licensing or acquisition of additional assets, such as inclacumab. With the exception of Oxbryta, all of our other potential product candidates remain in the earlier development stages. Research programs to\n \n\n\n69\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nidentify product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources, whether or not any product candidates are ultimately identified. Our research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for many reasons, including the following:\n \n\n\n\u2022\nthe research methodology used may not be successful in identifying potential product candidates; \n\n\n\u2022\ncompetitors may develop alternatives that render our product candidates obsolete or less attractive; \n\n\n\u2022\nproduct candidates we develop may nevertheless be covered by third parties\u2019 patents or other exclusive rights; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe market for a product candidate may change during our program so that such a product may become unreasonable to continue to develop; \n\n\n\u2022\na product candidate may on further study be shown to have harmful side effects, lack of potential efficacy or other characteristics that indicate it is unlikely to meet applicable regulatory criteria or remain reasonable to continue to develop; \n\n\n\u2022\na product candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all; and \n\n\n\u2022\na product candidate may not be accepted as safe and effective by patients, the medical community or third-party payors, if applicable. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we fail to develop and successfully commercialize inclacumab, GBT601 or any other product candidates, our business and future prospects may be harmed and our business will be more vulnerable to any problems that we encounter in developing and commercializing Oxbryta.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nIf successful product liability claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability and costs. If the use of Oxbryta or our product candidates harms patients, or is perceived to harm patients even when such harm is unrelated to Oxbryta or our product candidates, our regulatory approvals could be revoked or otherwise negatively impacted and we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe commercialization of Oxbryta, the use of Oxbryta and our product candidates, including inclacumab and GBT601, in clinical trials and the sale of any other products for which we obtain marketing approval exposes us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products. There is a risk that Oxbryta or our product candidates may induce adverse events. The risk of product liability claims may be increased now that Oxbryta is approved and being sold. If we cannot successfully defend against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liability and costs. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n \n\n\n\u2022\nimpairment of our business reputation; \n\n\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants; \n\n\n\u2022\ncosts due to related litigation; \n\n\n\u2022\ndistraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business; \n\n\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants; \n\n\n\u2022\nincreased warnings on product labels or additional restrictions imposed by regulatory authorities; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe recall of Oxbryta or our product candidates; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize Oxbryta or our product candidates; and \n\n\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for Oxbryta or our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe carry product liability insurance in amounts that we believe are sufficient in light of our current commercial activities and clinical programs, but we may not be able to obtain and maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs or medical treatments that had unanticipated adverse effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could adversely affect our results of operations and business.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDuring the course of treatment, patients may suffer adverse events, including death, for reasons that may or may not be related to our products or product candidates. Such events can be time-consuming to address, could subject us to costly litigation, require us\n \n\n\n70\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nto pay substantial amounts of money to injured patients, can delay, negatively impact or end our opportunity to receive or maintain regulatory approval to market our products or product candidates, if approved, can require us to suspend or abandon our commercialization efforts of any approved product candidates, or can impair our ability to raise funds to pursue our development or commercialization efforts. Investigations of these events may interrupt our sales efforts, delay our regulatory approval process in other countries, or impact and limit the type of regulatory approvals our product candidates receive or maintain. As a result of these factors, a product liability claim, even if successfully defended, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may choose to use our financial and human resources to pursue a particular research program or product candidate and fail to capitalize on other programs or product candidates that may ultimately be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBecause we have limited resources, we may forego or delay the pursuit of opportunities with programs or product candidates or for indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential than those we do pursue. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs for product candidates, including inclacumab and GBT601, may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through strategic collaboration, licensing or other partnering arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate, or we may allocate internal resources to a product candidate in a therapeutic area in which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a partnering arrangement.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nAny of our current or potential future collaboration, distribution or other arrangements may not be successful, which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may seek collaboration, distribution or other arrangements with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for the development or commercialization of Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 and other product candidates. For example, we have entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement with Syros Pharmaceuticals, Inc., to discover, develop and commercialize novel therapies for SCD and beta thalassemia, a License Agreement with Sanofi, under which we received an exclusive license under certain intellectual property controlled by Sanofi to use, develop, manufacture, commercialize and otherwise exploit certain compounds for the treatment of SCD and other human diseases, and an exclusive Distribution Agreement with Biopharma-MEA to distribute Oxbryta in the GCC region. We may enter into additional collaboration, distribution or other arrangements on a selective basis depending on the merits of retaining commercialization rights for ourselves as compared to entering into selective arrangements with leading pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for our products or product candidates, both in the United States and internationally. To the extent that we decide to enter into such arrangements, we will face significant competition in seeking appropriate partners. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for any collaboration, distribution or other arrangement will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the partner\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed arrangement and the proposed partner\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, the potential market for a product or a product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering a product or product candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, any uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can occur if there is a challenge to our ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge and industry and market conditions generally. Moreover, these arrangements are complex and time consuming to negotiate, document and implement, and we may not be successful in our efforts to establish and implement additional collaborations or other alternative arrangements should we so chose to enter into such arrangements. The terms of any collaborations or other arrangements that we may establish may not be favorable to us.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAny collaboration, license, distribution or other arrangement that we enter into may not be successful, may be modified or implemented in ways that are unfavorable to us and may increase our potential liabilities. The success of our arrangements will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of us and our partners, who generally have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations. Disagreements between parties to an arrangement regarding research, development and commercialization matters can lead to delays in the development process or commercializing the applicable product or product candidate and, in some cases, costly and time-consuming disputes, negotiations or termination of the arrangement. These disagreements can be difficult to resolve successfully, and any such termination or expiration would adversely affect us financially and could harm our business reputation. In addition, we are reliant on our partners\u2019 compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the region in which they operate, such as in the GCC region with respect to our arrangement with Biopharma-MEA. A partner\u2019s failure to comply with applicable law could result in liability for us, and negatively impact our operations and business reputation. Many of such arrangements in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries do not result in successful outcomes, for a wide variety of reasons.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n71\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur current and anticipated international operations may expose us to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial, pricing and reimbursement and economic risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur business strategy currently incorporates international operations and expansion, including plans to conduct ongoing and additional studies inside and outside the United States, plans to commercialize Oxbryta in the EU and, subject to regulatory approval, the UK, and plans to seek regulatory approval to commercialize Oxbryta in additional patient populations. Doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including but not limited to:\n \n\n\n\u2022\nrestrictions and obligations imposed by privacy regulations, such as provisions under the GDPR, applicable to the collection and use of personal health data in the EU; \n\n\n\u2022\nmultiple, conflicting, and changing laws and regulations such as tax laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, regulatory requirements, and any requirements to obtain other governmental approvals, permits, and licenses; \n\n\n\u2022\nfailure by us to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for the sale or use of our products in various countries; \n\n\n\u2022\nadditional potentially relevant third-party patent rights; \n\n\n\u2022\ncomplexities and difficulties in obtaining protection for and enforcing our intellectual property; \n\n\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing our current and potential foreign operations; \n\n\n\u2022\ncomplexities associated with managing multiple payor reimbursement regimes, government payors, or patient self-pay systems; \n\n\n\u2022\nlimits in our ability to penetrate international markets; \n\n\n\u2022\nfinancial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty collecting accounts receivable, the impact of local and regional financial crises on demand and payment for our products, and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; \n\n\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism, and political unrest (such as the current Ukrainian crisis with Russia), public health risks (such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), protests (such as the current Canadian trucker protest), boycotts, curtailment of trade, and other business interruptions and restrictions; \n\n\n\u2022\ncertain expenses including, among others, expenses for travel, translation, and insurance; and \n\n\n\u2022\nregulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over sales and activities that may fall within the purview of the FCPA, its books and records provisions, or its anti-bribery provisions. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAny such factors may impose additional responsibilities, obligations or liability in relation to our current and planned activities outside the United States, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms and make additional expenditures to ensure compliance with existing and new requirements, which could significantly harm our international operations and potential expansion and, consequently, our results of operations.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are subject to certain U.S. and foreign anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, export control, sanctions, and other trade laws and regulations (collectively, \u201cTrade Laws\u201d). We can face serious consequences for violations.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAmong other matters, Trade Laws prohibit companies and their employees, agents, clinical research organizations, legal counsel, accountants, consultants, contractors, and other partners from authorizing, promising, offering, providing, soliciting, or receiving directly or indirectly, corrupt or improper payments or anything else of value to or from recipients in the public or private sector. Violations of Trade Laws can result in substantial criminal fines and civil penalties, imprisonment, the loss of trade privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other consequences. We have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities, and other organizations. We also expect our activities outside the United States to increase over time. We engage third parties for clinical trials and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent registrations, and other regulatory approvals, have entered into an exclusive agreement with Biopharma-MEA to distribute Oxbryta in the GCC region, and expect to contract with additional third parties with respect to the distribution and commercialization of Oxbryta and our other product candidates in territories outside the United States, if approved for marketing in any such territories. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our personnel, agents, or partners, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have prior knowledge of such activities.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n72\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMisconduct or other improper activities of our employees, agents, contractors or collaborators could adversely affect our reputation and our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe cannot ensure that our compliance controls, policies, and procedures will in every instance protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents, contractors or collaborators that would violate the law or regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including FDA, healthcare, employment, foreign corrupt practices, environmental, competition, and patient privacy regulations. Misconduct by our employees, agents, contractors, or collaborators could include intentional or unintentional failures to:\n \n\n\n\u2022\ncomply with FDA or EMA regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities; \n\n\n\u2022\nprovide accurate information to the FDA or EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities; \n\n\n\u2022\ncomply with cGMP regulations and manufacturing standards that we have established and comply with applicable healthcare fraud and abuse regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate; \n\n\n\u2022\nreport financial information or data accurately; or \n\n\n\u2022\ndisclose unauthorized activities to us. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Misconduct could also involve the improper use of, including trading on, information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, our business activities may be subject to the FCPA and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate. The FCPA generally prohibits offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to influence official action, or otherwise obtain or retain business. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Our business is heavily regulated and, therefore, involves significant interaction with public officials, including officials of non-U.S. governments. Additionally, in many other countries, the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThere is no certainty that all of our employees, agents, contractors, or collaborators, or those of our affiliates, will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, particularly given the high level of complexity of these requirements. We have adopted a code of conduct, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may be ineffective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these requirements. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our third-party vendors, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our business and operations.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our third-party vendors are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures, and the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches. With respect to our data and information technology infrastructure, we continue to invest in the protection of such infrastructure, but there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or identify breaches in our systems.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf any such event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could adversely affect our business and operations or result in the loss of critical or sensitive information, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us. For example, the loss of data from completed or ongoing clinical trials or nonclinical studies for Oxbryta or any of our product candidates could harm our commercialization activities, result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed. In addition, our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks and other related breaches. As a result, any such cyber-attacks or breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n73\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Equity Securities\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced volatility since our initial public offering in August 2015 and is likely to continue to be volatile. Our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including the following:\n \n\n\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully develop and commercialize Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 or any other product candidates, especially results relating to our commercialization of Oxbryta in the United States; \n\n\n\u2022\nadverse results or delays in, or the halting of, our nonclinical studies or clinical trials, especially in our ongoing or future clinical program for Oxbryta for the treatment of SCD; \n\n\n\u2022\nreports of adverse events from our commercialization or clinical trials of Oxbryta, or from clinical trials of any other product candidates that we may develop; \n\n\n\u2022\nany delay in the review of, or potential action with respect to, our previous or planned filing of any IND, NDA, MAA or equivalent regulatory filing for Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 or for any other product candidates that we may develop and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the FDA\u2019s or any other regulatory agency\u2019s review of such filing; \n\n\n\u2022\nadverse regulatory decisions affecting Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 or any other product candidates we may develop, including any delay in or denial of potential approval in accordance with our plans and expectations; \n\n\n\u2022\ninability to obtain additional funding; \n\n\n\u2022\nfailure to prosecute, maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights; \n\n\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies; \n\n\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to Oxbryta or future products; \n\n\n\u2022\ninability to obtain adequate product supply for Oxbryta or our product candidates or the inability to do so at acceptable prices; \n\n\n\u2022\nintroduction of new products, services or technologies by our competitors; \n\n\n\u2022\nfailure to enter into or perform under strategic collaborations; \n\n\n\u2022\nfailure to meet or exceed any financial projections that we or the investment community may provide; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe perception of the pharmaceutical industry by the public, legislatures, regulators and the investment community; \n\n\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors; \n\n\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key scientific or management personnel; \n\n\n\u2022\nsignificant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation; \n\n\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies; \n\n\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future; \n\n\n\u2022\ntrading volume of our common stock; and \n\n\n\u2022\nthe other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, companies trading in the stock market in general, and the NASDAQ Stock Market, or NASDAQ, in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. For example, negative publicity regarding drug pricing and price increases by pharmaceutical companies has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, the markets for biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in\n \n\n\n74\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nsubstantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or our guidance.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. Our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including the following:\n \n\n\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully commercialize Oxbryta or any of our product candidates, if approved, and the timing and costs of our commercialization activities; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe timing and cost of, and level of investment in, research and development activities relating to Oxbryta and our product candidates, which may change from time to time; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe timing and success or failure of clinical trials for Oxbryta and our product candidates or competing product candidates, or any other change in the competitive landscape of our industry, including consolidation among our competitors or partners; \n\n\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain and maintain full regulatory approval for Oxbryta in the United States (including potential pediatric approval) and to obtain regulatory approval of Oxbryta outside of the United States and the EU (including potential UK approval) as well as regulatory approval for our product candidates, and the timing and scope of any such approvals we may receive; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe cost of manufacturing Oxbryta and our product candidates, which may vary depending on the quantity of production and the terms of our agreements with manufacturers; \n\n\n\u2022\nour ability to attract, hire, train and retain qualified personnel; \n\n\n\u2022\nexpenditures that we will or may incur to acquire or develop additional product candidates and technologies; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe level of demand for Oxbryta and our product candidates, if approved, which may vary significantly; \n\n\n\u2022\nfuture accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe risk/benefit profile, cost and reimbursement policies with respect to Oxbryta and our products candidates, if approved, and existing and potential future drugs that compete with Oxbryta and our product candidates; \n\n\n\u2022\nwhether Oxbryta or any of our product candidates are subject to any compliance-related challenges or sanctions, or any intellectual-property related challenges; and \n\n\n\u2022\nthe changing and volatile U.S., European and global economic environments, including economic volatility as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe cumulative effects of these factors could result in large fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly and annual operating results. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. This variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our operating results fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any forecasts we may provide to the market, or if the forecasts we provide to the market are below the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Such a stock price decline could occur even when we have met any previously publicly stated financial guidance we may provide.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans or upon the conversion of the 2028 Notes, would result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe will need additional capital in the future to continue our planned operations. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. These sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders. In August 2020, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 relating to the registration of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units or any combination thereof. Concurrently with the filing of such registration\n \n\n\n75\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nstatement, we entered into an \"at-the-market\" offering program, or ATM, which provides for the offering, issuance and sale by us of up shares of our common stock from time to time for aggregate gross proceeds of up to $200.0 million in sales deemed to be \u201cat-the-market offerings\u201d as defined by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. \nAs of \nDecember 31, 2021, we have \nsold and issued 1,601,884 shares of common stock pursuant to the ATM, with total gross proceeds of $45.4 million before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and other offering expenses payable by us of $1.4 million. \nAny additional sale or issuance of securities pursuant to this registration statement or otherwise may result in dilution to our stockholders and may cause the market price of our stock to decline. Furthermore, new investors purchasing securities that we may issue and sell in the future could obtain rights superior to the rights of our existing stockholders.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are also authorized to grant stock options and other equity-based awards to our employees, directors and consultants pursuant to our Amended and Restated 2015 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, or 2015 Plan. The number of shares available for future grant under the 2015 Plan will automatically increase each year by up to 4% of all shares of our capital stock outstanding as of December 31 of the prior calendar year, subject to the ability of our board of directors or compensation committee to take action to reduce the size of the increase in any given year. In addition, our Amended and Restated 2017 Inducement Plan, or the 2017 Inducement Plan, enables us and our subsidiaries to grant non-qualified stock options and other equity-based awards to induce employees who are not currently employed by us or our subsidiaries to accept employment with us or our subsidiaries. As of January 31, 2022, there were 1,611,486 shares reserved under the 2017 Inducement Plan (subject to adjustment for reorganization, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, or similar changes in our capital stock) for issuance to new employees entering into employment with us. We have also reserved shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to our Amended and Restated 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or 2015 ESPP, which number of shares will automatically increase each year on January 1, from January 1, 2016 to January 1, 2025, by the lesser of 3,000,000 shares of common stock, (ii) 1% of all shares of our capital stock outstanding as of December 31 of the prior calendar year, or (iii) such lesser number of shares as determined by the administrator of our 2015 ESPP. Currently, we plan to register any increase in the number of shares available for issuance under the 2015 Plan, the 2017 Inducement Plan, and the 2015 ESPP promptly following the effectiveness of any such increase. If our board of directors elects to increase the number of shares available for future grant under the 2015 Plan, the 2017 Inducement Plan or the 2015 ESPP, our stockholders may experience additional dilution, and our stock price may fall.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares may be sold into the market in the near future, which could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. A significant portion of our outstanding shares of common stock are held by a small number of stockholders, including our directors, officers and significant stockholders. Sales by our stockholders of a substantial number of shares, or the expectation that such sales may occur, could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock.\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have also registered or intend to register all shares of our common stock subject to options or other equity awards issued or reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans. As a result, these shares will be available for sale in the public market subject to vesting arrangements and exercise of options, and restrictions under applicable securities laws. In addition, our directors, executive officers and certain affiliates have established or may in the future establish programmed selling plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act for the purpose of effecting sales of our common stock. If any of these events cause a large number of our shares to be sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock and impede our ability to raise future capital.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur executive officers, directors, five percent stockholders and their affiliates beneficially owned approximately 52% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2021, based on the latest publicly available information. These stockholders have the ability to influence us through their ownership positions. These stockholders may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders, acting together, may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may believe are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n76\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have broad discretion in the use of our capital resources consisting of cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term marketable securities, and may invest or spend our capital resources in ways with which you do not agree or in ways that ultimately may not increase the value of your investment.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have broad discretion over the use of our capital resources consisting of cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term marketable securities. You may not agree with our decisions, and our use of our capital resources may not yield any returns to our stockholders. We expect to use our existing capital resources to continue the commercialization and clinical development of Oxbryta for the treatment of SCD, including in our Phase 2a HOPE-KIDS 1 Study, our Phase 3 HOPE-KIDS 2 Study, our other research and development activities including other clinical and nonclinical studies, including for inclacumab and GBT601, and for working capital and general corporate purposes. Our failure to apply our capital resources effectively could compromise our ability to pursue our growth strategy and we might not be able to yield a significant return, if any, on our investment of these resources. Our stockholders will not have the opportunity to influence our decisions on how to use our capital resources.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nProvisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders or remove our current management.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management. Our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n \n\n\n\u2022\nauthorize \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock; \n\n\n\u2022\ncreate a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms; \n\n\n\u2022\nspecify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the chairperson of our board of directors, our chief executive officer or our president; \n\n\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent; \n\n\n\u2022\nestablish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors; \n\n\n\u2022\nprovide that our directors may be removed only for cause; \n\n\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; \n\n\n\u2022\nspecify that no stockholder is permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors; \n\n\n\u2022\nexpressly authorize our board of directors to modify, alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws; and \n\n\n\u2022\nrequire supermajority votes of the holders of our common stock to amend specified provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws. \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAny provision of our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur future ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have incurred substantial losses during our history and do not expect to become profitable in the near future and we may never achieve profitability. To the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses, unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value or vote) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. We experienced an ownership change as a result of our initial public offering and an ownership change as a result of some of our\n \n\n\n77\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nfollow-on offerings; however we do not believe that these ownership changes will significantly limit our ability to use these pre-change NOL carryforwards. We may experience subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, including as a result of our future follow-on offering, some of which are outside of our control. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may become subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. In addition, pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (as modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020), we may not use net operating loss carry-forwards arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 to reduce our taxable income in any year beginning after December 31, 2021 by more than 80% and we may not carry back any net operating losses arising in taxable years ending after December 31, 2021 to prior years. These new rules apply regardless of the occurrence of an \u201cownership change.\u201d\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and, consequently, our stockholders\u2019 ability to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe do not currently intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future. Since we do not intend to pay dividends, your ability to receive a return on your investment will depend on any future appreciation in the market value of our common stock. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate or even maintain the price at which our holders have purchased it.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGeneral Risk Factors\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur ability to invest in and expand our business and meet our financial obligations, to attract and retain third-party contractors and collaboration partners and to raise additional capital depends on our operating and financial performance, which, in turn, is subject to numerous factors, including the prevailing economic and political conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control, such as the rate of unemployment (particularly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), the number of uninsured persons in the United States, the results of presidential elections, other political influences and inflationary pressures. For example, an overall decrease in or loss of insurance coverage among individuals in the United States as a result of unemployment, underemployment or the potential repeal of certain provisions of the ACA, may decrease the demand for healthcare services and pharmaceuticals. Additionally, the availability of healthcare services and resources is currently constrained due to the COVID-19 pandemic. If fewer patients are seeking medical care because they do not have insurance coverage or are unable to obtain medical care for their conditions due to resource constraints on the healthcare system, we may experience difficulties in the commercialization of Oxbryta and any eventual commercialization of our product candidates, and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, certain events have caused, and may cause or contribute to global financial crises, which have triggered and may in the future lead to extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. For example, in January 2020, the U.K. formally exited from the EU (such event commonly known as Brexit). Brexit has and could continue to adversely affect European and/or worldwide economic and market conditions and could continue to contribute to instability in the global financial markets and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including affecting our existing relationships with third parties that conduct some of our nonclinical studies and clinical trials and our ability to enter into new relationships with vendors and other third-party contractors, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations. The measures could also adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital, potentially disrupt the markets in which we currently conduct and plan to conduct operations and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and adversely change tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions. In addition, changes in, and legal uncertainty with regard to, national and international laws and regulations may present difficulties for our clinical and regulatory strategy.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nA severe or prolonged economic downturn, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in a variety of risks to our business, including reduced ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy could also strain our relationships with our contractors and potential collaboration partners. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic, current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n78\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe incur significant costs, and expend significant time and effort, to comply with the rules applicable to us as a public company, including Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. If we fail to comply with these rules, including maintaining proper and effective systems of disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, and we could be subject to sanctions or other penalties that would harm our business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or Exchange Act, Section 404, or Section 404, of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley, and the rules and regulations of NASDAQ. The Exchange Act requires us to file accurate and timely quarterly, annual and current reports with the SEC. Section 404 generally requires our management and independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and requires us to include an opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We are also subject to significant corporate governance and executive compensation-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or Dodd-Frank, including the \u201csay on pay\u201d rules adopted by the SEC under Dodd-Frank. We incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses, and expend significant time and effort by management and other personnel, to comply with the rules applicable to us as a public company.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the purpose of providing the reports required by Section 404. Based on our assessment and using the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO, criteria, our management, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have concluded that, as of December 31, 2021, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. As required under Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, our independent registered public accounting firm has tested the design and operating effectiveness of our controls over financial reporting and has provided the required attestation report with respect to our internal control over financial reporting. During the course of our or their subsequent review and testing, however, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may be identified and we may be unable to remediate them before we must provide the required reports. If material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are identified in the future, we may not detect or remediate errors on a timely basis and our consolidated financial statements may be materially misstated. We or our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, which could harm our operating results, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and cause the trading price of our stock to fall. In addition, any failure to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis could result in sanctions, lawsuits, delisting of our shares from NASDAQ or other adverse consequences that would materially harm our business.\n \n\n\nMoreover, stockholder activism, the current political environment, and increased levels of government scrutiny and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations for public companies, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to any new compliance initiatives. In addition, any new rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain our current levels of such coverage. New laws and regulations as well as changes to existing laws and regulations affecting public companies, including the provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley and rules adopted by the SEC and by NASDAQ, would likely result in increased costs to us as we respond to their requirements.\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by earthquakes, outbreaks of disease (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other natural disasters, and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEarthquakes, outbreaks of disease (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been prevented from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, and future events (including pandemics, earthquakes, power outages or natural disasters) may prevent us in the future from using all or a significant portion of our facilities. In addition, damage to or restrictions on the use of critical infrastructure, such as the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers or other facilities critical to our research and development activities, may render it difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue certain aspects of our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place currently are limited and are unlikely to prove adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which, particularly when taken together with our lack of earthquake insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n79\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could negatively impact our financial condition.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe rules dealing with U.S. federal, state and local income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Treasury Department. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect our stockholders or us. In recent years, many such changes have been made and changes are likely to continue to occur in the future. For example, in December 2017, Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which made broad and complex changes to the tax laws. Further, the current U.S. Presidential administration and Congress continue to consider changes in U.S. tax laws. We cannot predict whether, when, in what form, or with what effective dates, tax laws, regulations and rulings may be enacted, promulgated or decided, which could result in an increase in our, or our stockholders\u2019, tax liability or require changes in the manner in which we operate in order to minimize increases in our tax liability.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe trading market for our common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. Securities and industry analysts may not publish an adequate amount of research on our company, which may negatively impact the trading price for our stock. In addition, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline or increase in volatility. Further, if our operating results fail to meet the forecasts of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\n \n\n\n80\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "item7": ">Item 7.\n Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \n\n\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the section of this annual report entitled \u201cSelected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report. This discussion and other parts of this annual report contain forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions. In this annual report, words such as \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d and similar expressions (as well as other words or expressions referencing future events, conditions or circumstances) are intended to identify forward-looking statements, as described elsewhere herein. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this annual report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\n \n\n\nOverview\n \n\n\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company driven by our mission to discover, develop and deliver life-changing treatments that provide hope to underserved patient communities, starting with sickle cell disease, or SCD. Founded in 2011, our goal is to transform the treatment and care of SCD, a lifelong, devastating inherited blood disorder that is marked by red blood cell destruction and occluded blood flow and hypoxia, which leads to anemia, stroke, multi-organ failure, severe pain crises, and shortened patient life span. SCD is also marked by a historical lack of understanding, investment and attention. Although the fundamental cause of SCD has been understood for decades, therapeutic innovation and access to care have historically lagged compared to many other rare diseases. For example, there are approximately three times more individuals in the United States living with SCD than cystic fibrosis. However, since the enactment of the Orphan Drug Act passed in 1983, only four drugs have been approved for SCD compared to at least 15 drugs approved for cystic fibrosis. As a result of the lack of treatment options, patients with SCD suffer serious morbidity and premature mortality.\n \n\n\nWe continue to make progress on our mission to bring innovative therapies to the SCD community. Our first medicine, Oxbryta, an oral therapy taken once daily, is the first and only FDA-approved treatment that directly inhibits sickle hemoglobin polymerization, the root cause of the sickling and destruction of red blood cells in SCD. Oxbryta was granted accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in November 2019, for the treatment of SCD in adults and children 12 years of age and older, and we have since continued to grow Oxbryta commercially, with the net number of patients taking Oxbryta increasing each quarter. In addition, in October 2021, Oxbryta was recognized by Prix Galien USA with the prestigious Best Biotechnology Product award.\n \n\n\nWe have also been working to expand Oxbryta\u2019s reach to patients at younger ages as we believe early intervention is critically important for SCD patients. Starting a disease-modifying therapy earlier in life could potentially help prevent symptoms and end-organ damage that occurs over time in SCD patients. This could potentially improve the daily lives of children and their families, improve patient outcomes and lead to less utilization of healthcare, reducing healthcare costs for patients and families, and the overall healthcare system. In December 2021, the FDA granted accelerated approval to expand Oxbryta\u2019s indication for the treatment of SCD to children ages 4 to less than 12 years. The FDA also approved Oxbryta tablets for oral suspension, a dispersible, once-daily tablet dosage form suitable for patients ages 4 to less than 12 years as well as for older patients who have difficulty swallowing whole tablets. We will continue to study Oxbryta in patients as young as 6 months old to less than 4 years, as we look to potentially further expand access to Oxbryta.\n\n\nWorldwide, there are millions of people living with SCD, which occurs predominantly in populations of African, Middle Eastern and South Asian descent and has an estimated global incidence of 250,000 to 300,000 births annually. We are executing what we view as a thoughtful and sustainable approach and will consider distribution and funding approaches to potentially provide access to our products globally, including in sub-Saharan Africa and India. Across our current focus areas of the United States, Europe, the Gulf Cooperation Council, or GCC, region of the Middle East, and Latin America, we believe there is an opportunity to bring Oxbryta to more than 350,000 people living with SCD in the next several years.\n \n\n\nIn February 2022, the European Commission, or EC, granted marketing authorization for Oxbryta for the treatment of hemolytic anemia (which is low hemoglobin due to red blood cell destruction) due to SCD in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older as monotherapy or in combination with hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea), and such authorization includes all Member States of the European Union, or EU, as well as the additional Member States of the European Economic Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). Prior to such EC approval, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, adopted in December 2021 a positive opinion recommending marketing authorization for Oxbryta, subsequent to which we submitted an application to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, in the United Kingdom for a Great Britain Marketing Authorisation using the EC Decision Reliance Procedure.\n\n\n84\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo provide early access to patients prior to potentially receiving marketing approval, we established early access and named patient programs for eligible SCD patients outside the United States, and enrollment in these programs has included patients located in the United Kingdom, France and Germany. The United Kingdom and France have the majority of SCD patients in Europe.\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnder the exclusive agreement with our distribution partner, Biopharma-Middle East and Africa, or Biopharma-MEA, we continue to advance efforts to expand access to Oxbryta in the six countries that make up the GCC region (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, or UAE). In the GCC, the U.S. approval of Oxbryta can be referenced to allow access to the medicine while health authorities conduct their reviews. In the third quarter of 2021, we were granted marketing authorization for Oxbryta by the Ministry of Health and Prevention (MOHAP) in the UAE for the treatment of SCD in adults and children 12 years of age and older, with the UAE being the first country outside of the U.S. to grant regulatory approval of Oxbryta.\n\n\nWe have ongoing and planned clinical trials in multiple countries to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of Oxbryta, including trials designed to demonstrate that improving hemoglobin and reducing hemolysis leads to an improvement in organ dysfunction. These trials include the Phase 2a HOPE-KIDS 1 Study, an open-label, single- and multiple-dose trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and exploratory treatment effect of Oxbryta in pediatric patients as young as 6 months of age. These trials also include the HOPE-KIDS 2 Study, a post-approval confirmatory study we initiated in December 2019 as a condition of the accelerated approval of Oxbryta in the United States, that is using transcranial Doppler, or TCD, flow velocity to seek to demonstrate a decrease in stroke risk in children with SCD 2 to 15 years of age.\n\n\nBeyond Oxbryta, we are engaged in other research and development activities. Our development program includes inclacumab, a P-selectin inhibitor, currently in Phase 3 development to investigate its potential to reduce the incidence of painful vaso-occlusive crises, or VOCs and resulting hospital admissions. In addition, we are advancing GBT021601, or GBT601, our next generation hemoglobin polymerization inhibitor that is in Phase 1 development and was discovered by our scientists. Our drug discovery teams continue to work on new targets to potentially develop the next wave of treatments for SCD.\n \n\n\nAs part of our efforts to build our pipeline, we have entered into in-license and collaboration agreements and regularly evaluate opportunities to in-license, acquire or invest in new business, technology or assets or engage in related discussions with other business entities.\n \n\n\nWe licensed inclacumab from F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (together, \u201cRoche\u201d) under the License Agreement we entered into in August 2018, or Roche Agreement. Prior to licensing inclacumab to us, Roche conducted clinical studies that enrolled more than 700 non-SCD patients and demonstrated an encouraging pharmacokinetic, safety, and tolerability profile for inclacumab. We expect to be able to leverage the safety data from Roche\u2019s prior clinical studies, as we proceed with our development of inclacumab as a potential treatment to reduce the frequency of VOCs in patients with SCD and to reduce the hospital VOC readmission rate for patients that require inpatient treatment for an initial VOC episode. In July 2021, we announced the initiation of two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials of inclacumab. One study is a chronic prevention study with the primary endpoint of the rate of VOCs over a 48-week treatment period, and the other study is focusing on hospital readmissions with the primary endpoint of the rate of readmission to hospitals for VOC within 90 days following an initial hospitalization for a VOC.\n \n\n\nWe also have an ongoing early-stage research program under our collaboration with Syros Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Syros, under a License and Collaboration Agreement, or the Syros Agreement, entered into in December 2019, to discover, develop and commercialize novel therapies for SCD and beta thalassemia. We are currently exploring orally available, small molecule drugs designed to upregulate fetal hemoglobin. Under the Syros Agreement, we have an option to obtain an exclusive worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize any compounds or products resulting from the collaboration, subject to Syros\u2019 option to co-promote the first product in the United States.\n \n\n\nIn addition, we entered into a license agreement with Sanofi S.A., or Sanofi, in March 2021, under which we received an exclusive license under certain intellectual property controlled by Sanofi to use, develop, manufacture, commercialize and otherwise exploit certain compounds, including compounds directed against or that modulate one of two specified targets, or Licensed Compounds, for the treatment of human diseases worldwide. We currently intend to explore the Licensed Compounds for the potential treatment of SCD, and we believe the mechanisms are distinct and potentially complementary to that of Oxbryta.\n \n\n\nIn March 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, declared a global pandemic related to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, and the pandemic has impacted our business, including our commercialization of Oxbryta and our research and development activities. For example, we have seen a significant decrease in weekly new patient prescriptions for Oxbryta from a peak in early March 2020, and we expect the rate of new patient prescriptions may remain lower depending on the course of the pandemic. While we have resumed most of our operations that were temporarily paused at the beginning of the pandemic, our approach in some cases has changed to adapt to the new environment, such as the\n \n\n\n85\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nincreased use of digital and internet-based education and outreach to engage with healthcare professionals, or HCPs, and payors. We do not know how the adjustments we have made in our operations or the pandemic in general will impact our business in the long term. Notably, the pandemic has not significantly impacted our supply of Oxbryta. We continue to believe we have an adequate supply of Oxbryta to sustain estimated patient need through 2022, and we are continuing to produce Oxbryta tablets.\n\n\nOverall, our business model is aligned with our social purpose, which is centered on highlighting the disparities and inequalities of people living with SCD. This includes helping to address these issues through education, support of and engagement with the SCD community, as well as charitable giving, such as through The GBT Foundation we established in 2021. We believe that fostering a values-driven culture, developing and supporting our people, and creating a more diverse, equitable and inclusive environment for our employees can help us to better deliver for SCD patients.\n\n\nWe are not profitable and have incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations each year since our inception. We have financed our operations primarily through sale of equity securities and debt financing, including several follow-on offerings in 2019 through which we sold an additional of 3,986,890 shares of our common stocks for proceeds of $219.7 million net of underwriting costs and commissions and offering expenses. In December 2019, we entered into a $150.0 million term loan agreement, or 2019 Term Loan, and drew down proceeds of $72.5 million net of debt issuance costs, and we drew down the remaining $74.8 million net of debt issuance costs in November 2020. In December 2021, we entered into an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, or A&R Term Loan, which amended the 2019 Term Loan to increase the total term loan by $100.0 million. We received total proceeds, net of the debt issuance costs of $3.5 million, of $96.5 million. In December 2021, we issued an aggregate of $345.0 million principal amount of 1.875% convertible senior notes due 2028, or the 2028 Notes in a private placement. The aggregate principal amount on the 2028 Notes sold reflects the full exercise by the initial purchasers of their option to purchase to purchase an additional $45.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Notes. We received total proceeds net of debt issuance and offering costs of $11.0 million, of $334.0 million from the offering.\n\n\nOur net losses were $303.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, $247.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $266.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.3 billion. Substantially all of our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from selling, general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We had $734.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2021.\n \n\n\nCritical Accounting Polices and Estimates\n \n\n\nOur management\u2019s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management\u2019s judgments and estimates.\n \n\n\nRevenue Recognition\n \n\n\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, Topic 606, \nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n, or ASC 606\n, \nupon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services.\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nTo determine revenue recognition for arrangements that we determine are within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect substantially all of the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods or services we transfer to the customer.\n \n\n\nProduct sales, net\n \n\n\nOur product sales consist of U.S. sales of Oxbryta, which we began shipping to customers in December 2019. Prior to December 2019, we had no product sales. We sell Oxbryta in the United States to a limited number of specialty pharmacies and a specialty\n \n\n\n86\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\ndistributor (\neach a \u201cCustomer\u201d or collectively our \u201cCustomers)\n. These agreements with our Customers provide for transfer of title to the product at the time the product has been delivered to the Customers. The Customers subsequently dispense our product directly to a patient or resell our product to hospitals and certain pharmacies.\n \n\n\nWe recognize revenue on product sales when the Customers obtain control of our product, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon delivery to our Customers. It is at that point that we have a right to payment and that our Customers obtain title and the risks and rewards of ownership. Shipping and handling activities are considered to be fulfillment activities rather than a separate performance obligation. Payment terms are typically 30-60 days following delivery to our Customers.\n \n\n\nWe consider the effects of items that can decrease the transaction price such as variable consideration and consideration payable to Customers or payor. Amounts related to such items are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available. \nWe record revenue from product sales after considering the impact of various forms of variable consideration. Each of these items of variable consideration we record at the time of revenue recognition and requires significant estimates, judgment and information obtained from external sources. If management\u2019s estimates differ from actual results, we will record adjustments that would affect product sales in the period of adjustment.\n\n\nRebates: \nWe are subject to government mandated rebates for Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Benefit Program, and other government health care programs in the United States. Rebate amounts are based upon contractual agreements or legal requirements with public sector benefit providers. We use the expected-value method for estimating these rebates based on statutory discount rates and expected utilization. The expected utilization of rebates is estimated based on third-party data from the specialty pharmacies and specialty distributor. Estimates for these rebates are adjusted quarterly to reflect the most recent information. We record an accrued liability for unpaid rebates related to products for which control has been transferred to Customers.\n \n\n\nPrompt payment discounts\n: We provide discounts to our Customers if they pay for our products within a defined period of time after title transfers, which terms are explicitly stated in the contract. We use the most-likely-amount method for estimating prompt payment discounts. We expect that our Customers will earn prompt payment discounts. As a result, we deduct the full amount of those discounts from total product sales when revenues are recognized and record these discounts as a reduction of accounts receivable.\n \n\n\nCo-payment assistance:\n We provide co-payment assistance to patients who have commercial insurance and meet certain eligibility requirements. We use the expected-value method for estimating co-payment assistance based on estimates of program redemption using data provided by third-party administrators. Estimates for the co-payment assistance are adjusted quarterly to reflect actual experience. We record an accrued liability for unredeemed co-payment assistance related to products for which control has been transferred to Customers.\n \n\n\nMedicare Part D Coverage Gap: \nThe Medicare Part D coverage gap is a federal program to subsidize the costs of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries in the United States, which mandates manufacturers to fund a portion of the Medicare Part D insurance coverage gap for prescription drugs sold to eligible patients. Funding of the coverage gap is generally invoiced and paid in arrears. We estimate the impact of the Medicare Part D coverage gap using the expected-value method based on an amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter\u2019s activity, plus an accrual balance for known prior quarters. Estimates for the impact of the Medicare Part D coverage gap are adjusted quarterly to reflect actual experience. We record an accrued liability for unpaid reserves related to the Medicare Part D coverage gap.\n \n\n\nProduct returns:\n Consistent with industry practice, we offer limited product return rights and generally allow for the return of product that is damaged or defective, or within a few months prior to and up to a few months after the product expiration date. We consider several factors in the estimation of potential product returns, including expiration dates of the product shipped, the limited product return rights, third-party data in monitoring channel inventory levels, shelf life of the product, prescription trends, and other relevant factors. We expect product returns to be immaterial. Other than these limited returns, we do not provide any product warranties.\n \n\n\nChargebacks\n: Chargebacks are discounts that occur when contracted parties purchase directly from a specialty distributor. Contracted parties, which currently consist primarily of Public Health Service Institutions and federal government entities purchasing via the Federal Supply Schedule, generally purchase the product at a discounted price. The specialty distributor, in turn, charges back the difference between the price initially paid by the specialty distributor and the discounted price paid to the specialty distributor by the contracted parties to us. The reserves for chargeback are based on known sales to contracted parties. We establish the reserves for chargebacks in the same period that the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and receivables.\n \n\n\nDistributor fees:\n Our specialty distributor provides distribution services to us for a fee, based on a contractually determined fixed percentage of sales. We estimate these distributor fees and record such estimates in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue. We record an accrued liability for unpaid distributor fees.\n \n\n\n87\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEach of the above items is variable consideration, which we record at the time of revenue recognition, and require significant estimates, judgement and information obtained from external sources. If management\u2019s estimates differ from actual results, we will record adjustments that would affect product sales in the period of adjustment.\n \n\n\nThe following table summarizes activity with respect to our sales allowances and accruals for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRebates, co-payment\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nassistance, Medicare\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPart D coverage gap,\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPrompt payment\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nproduct returns and\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\ndiscounts and\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\ndistributor fees\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nchargebacks\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalances at December 31, 2019\n\n\n$\n\n\n529\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n113\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n642\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvision related to current period sales\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n13,697\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4,351\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n18,048\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit or payments made during the period\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(7,821\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(3,713\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(11,534\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance at December 31, 2020\n\n\n$\n\n\n6,405\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n751\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n7,156\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvision related to current period sales\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n23,543\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n9,405\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n32,948\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit or payments made during the period\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(19,743\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(9,227\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(28,970\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalance at December 31, 2021\n\n\n$\n\n\n10,205\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n929\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n11,134\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccruals of Research and Development and Manufacturing Costs\n \n\n\nWe record accruals for estimated costs of research, nonclinical and clinical studies and manufacturing development. These costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses. A substantial portion of our ongoing research and development activities are conducted by third-party service providers, including contract research organizations and contract manufacturing organizations. We also accrue for estimated costs of manufacturing activities for inventories, which are a significant component of the cost of our inventory.\n \n\n\nWe accrue the costs incurred under our agreements with these third parties based on actual work completed in accordance with agreements established with these third parties. We determine the accruals for research and development through discussions with internal personnel and external service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of the clinical studies and the agreed-upon fee to be paid for such services.\n \n\n\nThe accrual for contract manufacturing activities is based on an estimate of manufacturing activities completed to date, contractual rates, and amounts invoiced and paid to date at the end of each reporting period. We determine the percentage of manufacturing activities completed to date based on discussions with the contract manufacturing organizations, oversight of the manufacturing activities and anticipated timeline.\n \n\n\nActual clinical and manufacturing services performed, number of subjects enrolled, and the rate of subject enrollment may vary from our estimates, resulting in adjustments to research and development costs or inventories in future periods. Changes in these estimates that result in material changes to our accruals could materially affect our results of operations or amounts of inventories capitalized.\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n88\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nResults of Operations\n \n\n\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nChange\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2021/2020\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in thousands, except percentages)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct sales, net\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n194,749\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n123,803\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n70,946\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n57\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCosts and operating expenses:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost of sales\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3,316\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,986\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,330\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n67\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch and development\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n212,135\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n155,122\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n57,013\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n37\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelling, general and administrative\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n266,988\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n210,851\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n56,137\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n27\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGain on lease modification\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(984\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n984\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n*\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal costs and operating expenses\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n482,439\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n366,975\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n115,464\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n31\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoss from operations\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(287,690\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(243,172\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(44,518\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n18\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest income\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n720\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5,834\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(5,114\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n88\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest expense\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(15,467\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(9,809\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(5,658\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n58\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther expenses, net\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(177\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(406\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n229\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n56\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal other income (expense), net\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(14,924\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(4,381\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(10,543\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n241\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoss before income taxes\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(302,614\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(247,553\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(55,061\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n22\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvision for income taxes\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n477\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n477\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n*\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet loss\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n(303,091\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n(247,553\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n(55,538\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n22\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Change is not meaningful\n\n\nProduct sales, net\n \n\n\nProduct sales consist of sales of Oxbryta, which was approved by the FDA in November 2019 for the treatment of SCD in adults and children 12 years of age and older and approved by the FDA in December 2021 for the treatment of SCD in children ages 4 to less than 12 years. Product sales were $194.7 million and $123.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase was due to higher volume of sales driven by patient demand.\n \n\n\nCost of sales\n \n\n\nCost of sales of $3.3 million and $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, is related to manufacturing costs incurred after FDA approval related to the cost of Oxbryta sold. Prior to receiving the FDA\u2019s initial approval for Oxbryta in November 2019, we recorded all costs incurred in the manufacture of Oxbryta as research and development expense. We expect to sell inventory previously expensed to research and development throughout 2022, and, accordingly we expect our costs of product sales of Oxbryta to increase as a percentage of net sales in future periods as we produce and sell inventory that reflects the full cost of manufacturing the product.\n \n\n\nResearch and development\n \n\n\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of Oxbryta and product candidates, which include:\n \n\n\n\u2022\nemployee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation; \n\n\n\u2022\nexpenses incurred under agreements with consultants, third-party research and manufacturing organizations, and investigative clinical trial sites that conduct research and development activities on our behalf; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe costs related to production of clinical supplies, including fees paid to contract manufacturers; \n\n\n\u2022\nlaboratory and vendor expenses related to the execution of nonclinical studies and clinical trials; \n\n\n\u2022\npayments upon achievement of certain clinical development and regulatory milestones in relation with license agreement; and \n\n\n89\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nfacilities and other allocated expenses, which include expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, depreciation and amortization expense and other supplies. \n\n\nWe expense all research and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred. Costs for certain development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and clinical sites. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in future periods for use in research and development activities are deferred and capitalized. The capitalized amounts are then expensed as the related goods are delivered and the services are performed.\n \n\n\nThe primary component of our total operating expenses is our investment in research and development activities, including the clinical development of Oxbryta. We allocate research and development salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and indirect costs to Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 and other product candidates that we may pursue on a program-specific basis.\n \n\n\nWe expect our research and development expenses will increase in future periods as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to developing Oxbryta and product candidates, and as programs advance into later stages of development and we begin to conduct larger clinical trials. The process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming, and research and development is highly uncertain. As a result, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates.\n \n\n\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses incurred during the respective periods (in thousands, except percentages):\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nChange\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2021/2020\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCosts incurred by development program:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOxbryta for the treatment of SCD\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n94,553\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n83,945\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n10,608\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n13\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther preclinical programs\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n46,721\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n30,997\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n15,724\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n51\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInclacumab for the treatment of SCD\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n46,816\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n25,817\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n20,999\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n81\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGBT601 for the treatment of SCD\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n24,045\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n14,363\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n9,682\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n67\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal research and development expenses\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n212,135\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n155,122\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n57,013\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n37\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch and development expenses increased by $57.0 million, or 37%, to $212.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $155.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to a $21.0 million increase in external costs for inclacumab related to clinical trial activities, including a $5.3 million clinical milestone payment to Roche, a $15.7 million increase in external costs for preclinical programs, a $10.6 million increase in expenses for Oxbryta related to manufacturing activities, and a $9.7 million increase in external costs for GBT601 due to manufacturing and clinical trial activities. Stock-based compensation expense related to research and development was $21.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to hiring additional personnel and stock price appreciation.\n\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n \n\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $56.1 million, or 27%, to $267.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $210.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $16.4 million increase in professional and consulting services supporting the commercial activities related to Oxbryta, a $15.5 million increase in external costs related to medical affairs, a $13.1 million increase in personnel costs (including higher stock-based compensation expense) due to a greater number of employees, and a $11.1 million increase in other general and administrative expense due to the growth of our operations. Selling, general and administrative related stock-based compensation expense was $57.4 million and $53.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n \n\n\nInterest income\n \n\n\nInterest income was $0.7 million in 2021 compared to interest income of $5.8 million in 2020. The $5.1 million decrease was primarily due to decrease in interest income from our investment balances.\n \n\n\n90\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInterest expenses\n \n\n\nInterest expense was $15.5 million in 2021 compared to interest expense of $9.8 million in 2020. The $5.7 million increase was primarily due to higher interest expense related to our A&R Term Loan, as a result of the timing of the drawdown of the term loan.\n\n\nIncome Taxes\n \n\n\nWe recorded an income tax expense of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The 2021 income tax expense was primarily related to the foreign tax expenses on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. No provision for income taxes was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2021, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1.0 billion to offset future federal taxable income, with $207.3 million available through 2037 and $840.2 million available indefinitely. We also had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $787.0 million that may offset future state taxable income, through 2041. Current federal and state tax laws include substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of an ownership change. Even if the carryforwards are available, they may be subject to annual limitations, lack of future taxable income, or future ownership changes that could result in the expiration of the carryforwards before they are utilized. At December 31, 2021, we recorded a 100% valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets of approximately $403.1 million, as at that time our management believed it was uncertain that they would be fully realized. If we determine in the future that we will be able to realize all or a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards, an adjustment to our net operating loss carryforwards would increase net income in the period in which we make such a determination.\n \n\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\n\n\nThe comparison of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 can be found in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 located within Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n \n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \n\n\nWe are not profitable and have incurred losses and negative cash flows from operations each year since our inception. We have financed our operations primarily through sale of equity securities and debt financing. As of December 31, 2021, we had $734.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. In December 2019, we entered into the 2019 Term Loan, with funds managed by Pharmakon Advisors LP, which are BioPharma Credit PLC, as collateral agent, Biopharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP, as a lender, and BPCR Limited Partnership, as a lender, and collectively, the Lenders, for a senior secured credit facility consisting of an initial tranche of $75.0 million and the option to draw an additional $75.0 million until December 2020. The first tranche, in the amount of $75.0 million, was funded in connection with the closing date of the Term Loan in December 2019, and the second tranche, in the amount of $75.0 million, was funded in November 2020. In December 2021, we entered into an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, or A&R Term Loan, which amended the 2019 Term Loan to increase the total term loan by $100.0 million. We received total proceeds, net of the debt issuance costs of $3.5 million, of $96.5 million.\n\n\nIn August 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, or Shelf Registration Statement, with the SEC relating to the registration of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units or any combination thereof. Concurrently with the filing of the Shelf Registration Statement, we entered into a Sales Agreement with SVB Leerink LLC, or Sales Agent, to provide for the offering, issuance and sale by us of up to an aggregate of $200.0 million of our common stock from time to time in \u201cat-the-market\u201d offerings under the Shelf Registration Statement, or Sales Agreement. We have agreed to pay to the Sales Agent cash commissions of up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds from sales of common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement. As of December 31, 2021, we have sold and issued 1,601,884 shares of common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement, with total gross proceeds of $45.4 million before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and other offering expenses payable by us of $1.4 million.\n\n\n In December 2021, we issued an aggregate of $345.0 million principal amount of 1.875% convertible senior notes due 2028 in a private placement. The aggregate principal amount on the 2028 Notes sold reflects the full exercise by the initial purchasers of their option to purchase to purchase an additional $45.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Notes. We received total proceeds, net of debt issuance and offering costs of $11.0 million, of $334.0 million from the offering.\n\n\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2028 Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with certain of the initial purchasers of the 2028 Notes and other financial institutions, totaling $46.8 million, which we refer to as the Capped Calls. The Capped Calls cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of our common stock that initially underlie the 2028 Notes (or 10,866,983 shares of our common stock). The Capped Calls have an initial strike price and an initial cap price of $31.7475 per share and $49.80 per share, respectively, subject to certain adjustments. Conditions that cause adjustments to the initial strike price of the Capped Calls mirror conditions that result in corresponding adjustments to the conversion price of the 2028 Notes. The Capped Calls\n \n\n\n91\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nare expected to offset the potential dilution to our common stock as a result of any conversion of the 2028 Notes, subject to a cap based on the cap price.\n \n\n\nOur primary use of cash is to fund operations. Cash used to fund operations is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses.\n \n\n\nWe believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund our planned operations for at least the next twelve months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We believe we may continue to require additional financing to commercialize Oxbryta, advance Oxbryta through clinical development, to acquire and develop other product candidates and to fund operations for the foreseeable future. We may continue to seek funds through equity or debt financings, collaborative or other arrangements with corporate sources, or through other sources of financing. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategies. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n \n\n\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully commercialize Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 and any other product candidates we may identify and develop in any territories; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe manufacturing, selling, and marketing costs associated with the commercialization of Oxbryta and the potential commercialization of inclacumab, GBT601 and any other product candidates we may identify and develop, including the cost and timing of establishing or maintaining our sales and marketing capabilities in any territory(ies); \n\n\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of sales and other revenues from Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 and any other product candidates we may identify and develop, including the sales price and the availability of adequate third-party reimbursement; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe time and cost necessary to conduct and complete multiple ongoing studies (including our HOPE-KIDS 1 Study, our Phase 3 HOPE-KIDS 2 Study, and other studies; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe time and cost necessary to conduct and complete any additional clinical studies required to pursue additional regulatory approvals for Oxbryta for SCD, including our Phase 3 HOPE-KIDS 2 Study (which is intended as our required confirmatory study to move from our current Subpart H approval to a full approval of Oxbryta) and any studies to support potential label expansions into younger SCD pediatric populations, or any other post-marketing studies for Oxbryta for SCD; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe progress, data and results of clinical trials of Oxbryta and product candidates; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe progress, timing, scope and costs of our nonclinical studies, our clinical trials and other related activities, including our ability to enroll subjects in a timely manner for our ongoing and future clinical trials of Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 or any other product candidate that we may identify and develop; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe costs of obtaining clinical and commercial supplies of Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 and any other product candidates we may identify and develop; \n\n\n\u2022\nour ability to advance our development programs, including for Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 and any other potential product candidate programs we may identify and pursue, the timing and scope of these development activities, and the availability of approval for any of our other product candidates; \n\n\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully obtain any additional regulatory approvals from any regulatory authorities, and the scope of any such regulatory approvals, to market and sell Oxbryta, inclacumab, GBT601 and any other product candidates we may identify and develop in any territory(ies); \n\n\n\u2022\nthe cash requirements of any future acquisitions or discovery of product candidates; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe time and cost necessary to respond to technological and market developments; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we may acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies, and the costs and timing associated with any such acquisitions or in-licenses; \n\n\n\u2022\nour ability to attract, hire, and retain qualified personnel; and \n\n\n\u2022\nthe costs of maintaining, expanding, and protecting our intellectual property portfolio. \n\n\nFurther, our operating plan may change, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements for commercialization, clinical trials and other research and development expenditures. We currently have no credit facility or\n \n\n\n92\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\ncommitted sources of capital. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of Oxbryta and product candidates and ongoing developments in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated commercialization, clinical trials and research and development activities.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash used in operating activities\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n(256,813\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n(211,862\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n12,110\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n317,312\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash provided by financing activities\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n434,335\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n87,120\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n319\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n189,951\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n192,570\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash flows from operating activities\n \n\n\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $256.8 million, consisting of a net loss of $303.1 million, which was partially offset by non-cash charges of $78.7 million for stock-based compensation and $10.0 million for net depreciation and amortization expense, including $1.4 million for non-cash interest expense. The change in our net operating assets and liabilities was due primarily to an increase of $17.7 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets due to prepayments made for clinical trial activities, an increase of $16.1 million in inventories, an increase of $11.3 million in accounts receivable due to timing of cash receipts associated with Oxbryta commercial sales, a decrease of $7.6 million in accrued liabilities due to growth of our operations and timing of receipt of invoices, a decrease of $4.8 million in operating lease liabilities due to payments made during the period, a decrease of $3.7 million in accounts payable due to timing of payments, and an increase of $3.7 million in accrued compensation related to higher number of employees.\n\n\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $211.9 million, consisting of a net loss of $247.6 million, which was partially offset by non-cash charges of $71.5 million for stock-based compensation and $12.5 million for net depreciation and amortization expense. The change in our net operating assets and liabilities was due primarily to an increase of $36.8 million in inventories to support our current and anticipated Oxbryta commercial sales, an increase in accounts receivable of $14.9 million due to higher Oxbryta commercial sales, a decrease of $10.1 million in accrued liabilities primarily due to the payout of the accrued $20.0 million upfront payment to Syros in January 2020 and timing of manufacturing activities offset by higher sales and allowance accrual due to higher Oxbryta commercial sales, an increase of $8.4 million in accounts payable due to timing of payments, and an increase of $6.4 million in accrued compensation related to higher number of employees.\n \n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nCash flows from investing activities\n \n\n\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $12.1 million, consisting of maturities of marketable securities of $65.7 million, which were offset by purchases of marketable securities of $50.4 million and purchases of property and equipment of $3.2 million.\n \n\n\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $317.3 million, consisting of maturities of marketable securities of $384.0 million, which were offset by purchases of marketable securities of $57.9 million and purchases of property and equipment of $8.8 million.\n \n\n\nCash flows from financing activities\n \n\n\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $434.3 million. The cash provided by financing activities in 2021 was primarily from net proceeds of $334.7 million in connection with the issuance of the 2028 Notes, net proceeds of $96.5 million from the December 2021 tranche of the Term Loan, net proceeds of $44.1 million from the issuance of common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement, net proceeds of $2.1 million from the issuance of common stock in connection with a private placement, proceeds of $7.0 million from the issuance of common stock to participants in the Amended and Restated 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, and exercise of stock options, which was partially offset by $46.8 million in connection with the purchase of the capped call and $3.1 million in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards.\n \n\n\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $87.1 million. The cash provided by financing activities in 2020 was primarily from net proceeds of $74.8 million from the second tranche of the 2019 Term Loan and $17.6 million from the issuance of common stock to participants in the ESPP and exercise of stock options, which were partially offset by $5.3 million of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards.\n \n\n\n93\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019\n\n\n Discussions of 2019 cash flow activities can be found in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 located within Part II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Liquidity, Capital Resources and Plan of Operations, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K as promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.\n \n\n\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\n \n\n\nIn August 2018, we entered a lease amendment to lease approximately 164,150 square feet of office space in South San Francisco, California, for our corporate office. The lease has a term of 10 years. The future minimum rental payment for this lease is $121.5 million. Under the lease, we are also obligated to pay the landlord certain costs, including taxes and operating expenses.\n \n\n\nIn December 2019, we entered into the 2019 Term Loan for a senior secured credit facility consisting of an initial term loan of $75.0 million, with an option to draw an additional $75.0 million until December 31, 2020. The first tranche of $75.0 million was funded in December 2019 and the second tranche of the $75.0 million was funded in November 2020.\n \n\n\nIn December 2021, we entered into the A&R Term Loan. The A&R Term Loan superseded in its entirety the 2019 Term Loan, dated as of December 17, 2019 and provided us with an additional term loan commitment from the Lenders in the aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million, or \u201cTranche C Loan\u201d. Further, the A&R Term Loan agreement extended the maturity date and interest payments for the previous tranches that were under the 2019 Term Loan to conform with the new Tranche C Loan. The Tranche C Loan is in addition to the initial term loan tranche in an aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million that was drawn upon execution of the Prior Loan Agreement in December 2019 and a subsequent term loan tranche in an aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million that was drawn under the Prior Loan Agreement in November 2020. The A&R Term Loan has a maturity date of December 17, 2027 with interest-only payments due until March 31, 2025. The A&R Term Loan bears interest at a floating per annum interest rate equal to 7.00% plus the greater of (a) the 3-month LIBOR rate and (b) 2%. Interest on amounts outstanding are payable quarterly in arrears. We are obligated to pay an additional fee to the Lenders determined by multiplying the principal amount being paid or prepaid multiplied by 2% when such payments are made. The obligations under the A&R Term Loan are secured by a first priority security interest in and a lien on substantially all of our assets, subject to certain exceptions.\n \n\n\nIn December 2021, we issued an aggregate of $345.0 million principal amount of 1.875% convertible senior notes due 2028 in a private placement. The aggregate principal amount on the 2028 Notes sold reflects the full exercise by the initial purchasers of their option to purchase to purchase an additional $45.0 million in aggregate principal amount of such 2028 Notes. We received total proceeds net of debt issuance and offering costs of $11.0 million, of $334.0 million from the offering. As of December 31, 2021, the 2028 Notes were recorded at the aggregate principal amount of $345.0 million, excluding debt discount of $10.9 million. The 2028 Notes are senior unsecured obligations and accrue interest at a rate of 1.875% per annum payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2022. The 2028 Notes mature on December 15, 2028, unless converted, redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms prior to such date.\n \n\n\nIn December 2019, we entered into the Syros Agreement to discover, develop and commercialize novel therapies for SCD and beta thalassemia. Under the agreement, Syros will use its leading gene control platform to identify therapeutic targets and discover drugs that potentially induce fetal hemoglobin, and we have an option to obtain an exclusive worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize any compounds or products resulting from the agreement, subject to Syros\u2019 option to co-promote the first product in the United States. If we exercise the option, we will be responsible for all development, manufacture, regulatory activities and commercialization of the compound or product. Syros and we will be responsible for our own costs incurred to conduct research activities, except that we will fund up to a total of $40.0 million in preclinical research for at least three years. Unless earlier terminated or extended, the research program under the agreement will end on the third anniversary of the agreement.\n \n\n\nUnder the terms of the Syros Agreement, we paid Syros an upfront payment of $20.0 million in January 2020, and, if we exercise our option under the agreement, we may be obligated to pay Syros up to $315.0 million in option exercise, development, regulatory, commercialization and sales-based milestones per product candidate and product resulting from the agreement. We will also be obligated to pay Syros, subject to certain reductions, tiered mid- to high-single digit royalties as percentages of calendar year net sales on any product resulting from the agreement. We have recognized the $20.0 million upfront payment in our research and development costs for year ended December 31, 2019. No milestone payments were recognized for the year ended December 31, 2021\n \n\n\n94\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nand 2020. We have recognized $11.5 million and $8.6 million of research reimbursement to Syros in our research and development cost for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n \n\n\nIn August 2018, we entered into the Roche Agreement pursuant to which Roche granted us an exclusive and sublicensable worldwide license under certain patent rights and know-how to develop and commercialize inclacumab for all indications and uses, except diagnostic use. Roche retained a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free license to inclacumab solely for any diagnostic use. As of December 31, 2019, we have paid Roche an upfront payment of $2.0 million, and as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we have paid Roche clinical development milestone payments of $5.3 million and $2.0 million, respectively. Under the Roche Agreement, we are obligated to make contingent payments to Roche totaling approximately $125.5 million in milestone payments for the SCD indication, including up to $40.5 million based on achievement of certain clinical development and regulatory milestones for inclacumab in the SCD indication, and up to $85.0 million based on achievement of certain thresholds for annual net sales of inclacumab. In addition, we are obligated under such agreement to make contingent payments to Roche up to an aggregate of $6.4 million in milestone payments that are owed to third parties, based on achievement of such clinical development and regulatory milestones for inclacumab. In addition, we are obligated to make contingent payments to Roche up to $19.25 million in milestone payments based on achievement of certain clinical development and regulatory milestones for inclacumab for any indication other than the SCD indication.\n \n\n\nIn March 2021, we entered into a license agreement with Sanofi, or the Sanofi Agreement, to exclusively in-license worldwide rights to two early-stage research programs in SCD: one that pursues a novel anti-sickling mechanism and another that leverages a new approach to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress. These mechanisms are distinct and potentially complementary to that of Oxbryta. The programs, from Sanofi\u2019s Bioverativ subsidiary, supplement our existing pipeline and support our strategy to address SCD from multiple approaches. Under the terms of the Sanofi Agreement, we will conduct all research, development, regulatory and commercialization activities worldwide. Sanofi received an upfront payment of $2.25 million and is entitled to payments up to approximately $351.0 million upon achievement of certain development, regulatory, commercial and sales-based milestones and single-digit tiered royalties on worldwide net sales.\n \n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, w\ne excluded $27.3 million related to uncertain tax positions in our contractual obligations and commitments as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement.\n\n\n \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAccounting Pronouncements Adopted\n \n\n\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2019-12, \nIncome Taxes (Topic 740), Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\n. The guidance eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. It also clarifies and simplifies other aspects of the accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020, and the applicable amendments will be applied on a prospective basis. We adopted ASU No. 2019-12 in the first quarter of 2021 and applied the guidance prospectively. The only aspect of ASU 2019-12 that is currently applicable to us is the removal of the exception related to intraperiod tax allocation. We began applying the general methodology regarding the intraperiod allocation of tax expense in 2021. After the adoption of ASU 2019-12, in periods where we have a loss from continuing operations, the amount of taxes attributable to continuing operations will be determined without regard to the tax effect of other items, including changes in unrealized gains related to marketable securities. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n \n\n\nIn August 2020, FASB issued ASU No. 2020-08, Codification Improvement to Subtopic 310-20, \nReceivables \u2013 Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs\n. The new guidance states that an entity should reevaluate whether a callable debt security is within scope of Topic 310-20. ASU 2020-08 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. We adopted ASU No. 2020-08 in the first quarter of 2021 and applied the guidance prospectively. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n \n\n\nIn August 2020, FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, \nDebt\u2014Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)\n. This ASU simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments and requires entities to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments in calculating diluted earnings-per-share. We early adopted ASU No. 2020-06 on January 1, 2021 using the modified retrospective method. We applied this ASU to the convertible debt transaction entered into in December 2021 (see Note 8). The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements as there were no outstanding financial instruments that require recombination at January 1, 2021.\n \n\n\n95\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAccounting P\nr\nonouncement Issued But Not Yet Adopted\n\n\nIn March 2020, FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, \nReference Rate Reform (Topic 848)\n. The new guidance contains practical expedients for reference rate reform related activities that impact debt, leases, derivatives, and other contracts. The guidance in ASU 2020-04 is optional and may be elected over time as reference rate reform activities occur. We continue to evaluate the impact of the guidance and may apply the elections as applicable as changes occur.\n \n\n", "item7a": ">Item 7A. \nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n \n\n\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\n \n\n\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate sensitivities. We have invested primarily in money market funds, negotiable certificates of deposit, U.S. treasury notes, federal agency notes and corporate debt securities. The fair value of our investments, including those included in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, was $721.9 million as of December 31, 2021 and $552.3 million as of December 31, 2020.\n \n\n\nOur investment policy is to limit credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities. We, along with our investment advisors, actively review current investment ratings, company specific events, and general economic conditions in managing our investments.\n \n\n\nWe performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio. Based on our investment positions as of December 31, 2021, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rate would result in a $0.7 million decline in the fair market value of our portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity.\n \n\n\nWe are also exposed to interest rate risk with respect to the senior secured credit facility that we entered into in December 2019 and amended in December 2021, or Term Loan, that bears variable interest based on LIBOR. The outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan was $250.0 million as of December 31, 2021. We currently do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. We monitor our market interest rate risk exposures from the Term Loan using a sensitivity analysis. Our sensitivity analysis estimates the exposure to the Term Loan assuming a hypothetical 100 basis points change in interest rates on our $250.0 million of unhedged variable rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in changes in the annual interest expenses recognized from the Term Loan of between $0.5 million and $2.5 million per year over the term of the debt.\n \n\n\nThese analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could impact interest rates. Further, in the event of an increase in interest rates of significant magnitude, we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure.\n \n\n\nEffect of Inflation\n\n\nInflation generally affects us by increasing our research and development and contract manufacturing costs. We do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations as of December 31, 2021.\n\n\n96\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "companyName": "Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc.", "cusip": "37954Y442"}
