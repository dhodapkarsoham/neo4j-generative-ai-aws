{"item1": ">Item 1. Business. \n\n\nOverview\n\n\nOur mission is to connect everyone in construction on a global platform.\n\n\nWe are a leading provider of cloud-based construction management software, and are helping transform one of the oldest, largest, and least digitized industries in the world. We focus exclusively on construction, connecting and empowering the industry\u2019s key stakeholders, such as owners, general contractors, specialty contractors, architects, and engineers, to collaborate from any location, on any internet-connected device. Our platform is modernizing and digitizing construction management by enabling real-time access to critical project information, simplifying complex workflows, and facilitating seamless communication among key stakeholders, all of which we believe positions us to serve as the system of record for the construction industry. Adoption of our platform helps customers increase productivity and efficiency, reduce rework and costly delays, improve safety and compliance, and enhance financial transparency and accountability.\n\n\nIn short, we build the software for the people that build the world.\n\n\nWe have established our market leadership through an approach focused on serving the unique needs of the construction industry. We work directly with stakeholders to develop the products they need and provide high-quality support, available to all users at no additional charge. Our four product categories, Preconstruction, Project Management, Resource Management, and Financial Management, automate workflows, provide real-time visibility, offer advanced analytics, and support collaboration across key stages of the construction project lifecycle. Each of our products can be accessed from the office or the jobsite on computers, smartphones, and tablets, enabling users to work wherever the job requires. Our open application programming interfaces (\u201cAPIs\u201d) and our application marketplace (\u201cApp Marketplace\u201d) allow customers to integrate our products with their internal systems and nearly 350 third-party applications, including accounting, document management, and scheduling software, providing our users with choice and flexibility, and demonstrably increasing the stickiness of our platform as we aim to become the construction industry\u2019s system of record.\n\n\nOur customers range from small businesses managing a couple million dollars of annual construction volume to global enterprises managing billions of dollars of annual construction volume. Our core customers are owners, general contractors, and specialty contractors operating across the commercial, residential, industrial, and infrastructure segments of the construction industry. We generate substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to access our products. We sell our products on a subscription basis for a fixed fee with pricing generally based on the number and mix of products a customer subscribes to and the fixed aggregate dollar volume of construction work contracted to run on our platform annually, which we refer to as annual construction volume. As our customers subscribe to additional products, or increase the annual construction volume contracted to run on our platform, we generate more revenue. We do not provide refunds for unused construction volume, or charge customers based on consumption or on a per project basis. Our customers rely on our platform to help run their businesses more efficiently.\n\n\nOur business model is designed to encourage rapid, widespread adoption of our products by allowing for unlimited users, meaning we do not charge a per-seat or per-user fee. Customers can invite all project participants to engage with our platform as part of a project team. Customers typically invite participants to join our platform, including the customer\u2019s employees and its collaborators, who are other project participants who engage with our platform but do not pay us for such use. Collaborators have access to relevant project information and product features for the duration of their involvement in a project and are incentivized to become customers, as collaborators do not control what information they get access to, they may not be able to access project information after a job is complete, and cannot run their complete portfolio of projects on our platform. In 2021 we had over 2.0 million users, which we define as our customers\u2019 employees and their collaborators who have logged in to our platform. Once collaborators have used our platform, they may potentially become customers and evangelize Procore on future projects. We believe our business model creates a flywheel effect that has helped increase our customer count, from 8,506 as of December 31, 2019, to 10,166 as of December 31, 2020, to 12,193 as of December 31, 2021, reflecting a consistent year-over-year growth rate of 20% in both 2020 and 2021. We have also seen an increase in the number of customers that contributed more than $100,000 of annual recurring revenue (\u201cARR\u201d), which grew from 655 as of December 31, 2019, to 843 as of December 31, 2020, to 1,111 as of December 31, 2021, reflecting year-over-year growth rates of 29% in 2020 and 32% in 2021. All customer counts aforementioned exclude the customers acquired from Levelset, LaborChart, and Esticom, Inc. (\u201cEsticom\u201d), as they are on non-standard legacy contracts. Levelset, LaborChart, and Esticom customers will be included in our customer and ARR metrics when they are renewed onto standard Procore annual contracts. Levelset has more than 3,000 customers as of December 31, 2021.\n\n\n4\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur success in building our customer base, expanding usage for existing customers, and helping digitize the industry has allowed us to achieve significant growth. We generated revenue of $289.2 million in 2019, $400.3 million in 2020 and \n$\n514.8 \nmillion in 2021, representing year-over-year growth of 38% in 2020 and \n29\n% in 2021. We had net losses of $83.1 million in 2019, $96.2 million in 2020, and \n$265.2\n million in 2021.\n\n\nOur Industry\n\n\nThe construction ecosystem is highly fragmented and specialized.\n\n\nThe construction process relies on coordination among highly fragmented and specialized groups, including key stakeholders such as owners, general contractors, specialty contractors, architects, and engineers. These stakeholders engage in financing, budgeting, designing, building, and maintaining commercial, residential, industrial, and infrastructure projects while navigating varying responsibilities, risk profiles, and motives. Completing a project safely, on time, and within budget requires effective collaboration between stakeholders across work streams, sharing information in a timely and effective manner, and navigating increasing contractual and regulatory complexity.\n\n\nKey stakeholders in the construction ecosystem are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nOwners.\n Owners initiate construction projects, secure financing, work with architects, engineers, and consultants on building design, hire general contractors to manage the construction process, and are the ultimate decision-makers throughout a project. Owners include corporations, universities, government entities, and commercial and residential real estate developers. Once a project is completed, owners are responsible for operating, leasing or selling the structure, or outsourcing such processes to a third party.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nGeneral contractors.\n General contractors coordinate the construction project and fulfill the demands of owners while simultaneously maintaining oversight and responsibility for specialty contractors and other vendors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nSpecialty contractors. \nSpecialty contractors, commonly referred to as subcontractors, are hired by general contractors for their specialized skills, such as mechanical, electrical, plumbing, roofing, or concrete trades, and perform the vast majority of construction work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nArchitects and engineers. \nArchitects and engineers work together to develop building plans and designs, collaborating directly with owners and general contractors. Typically architects are responsible for designing the aesthetic look and feel of a structure, while engineers focus on safety and functionality, materials, and structural design \n\n\nThe construction industry has four defining characteristics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nConstruction is a custom business\n. Construction projects are typically custom and each project has a distinctive combination of dynamic variables, including unique project teams, design, materials, terrain, regulations, and schedules. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nThe workforce is mobile and decentralized. \nConstruction happens on the jobsite, not at the office, which increases the importance of mobile access to project data. Construction workers often operate with out-of-date or incomplete project information and struggle to collaborate effectively with other stakeholders, leading to mistakes that may translate to costly rework and extended project timelines. Given mistakes not only impact the progress of the project but also expose workers to safety risks, the need for mobile collaboration solutions and real-time access to instructions, designs, documentation, and reporting is becoming increasingly critical for managing and optimizing a dispersed workforce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nStakeholder dynamics are complex.\n Construction projects require collaboration across a wide range of stakeholders who often have a different set of interests and lack familiarity and trust with one another, yet all are interdependent and ultimately share project risks. Similarly, all project participants are adversely impacted when a project is delayed, runs over budget, or does not meet quality or safety requirements. For example, a concrete contractor may not be able to pour concrete on a project until the mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (\u201cMEP\u201d) contractors complete their scope of work. If the MEP contractors fail to complete their tasks as scheduled and that delay is not properly communicated to all affected stakeholders, then not only could the project fall behind schedule but the concrete may still arrive at the jobsite as originally scheduled, become unusable, and need to be disposed of, driving up costs and impacting profit margins. In order to avoid related financial losses, stakeholders are often quick to redirect responsibility to other participants on a project and seek to resolve disputes in court.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nChange is constant.\n Construction project designs, schedules, and budgets are modified frequently. Construction teams typically run into unforeseen issues requiring a workaround, or the owner may decide to make a modification \n\n\n5\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto the project. As a result, the design that teams set out to build rarely matches the finished product. An event as small as a delayed inspection that adjusts worker schedules, or as significant as discovering an unexpected boulder during excavation that requires special equipment to remove, can trigger costly changes to a project\u2019s schedule and require timely communication to teams on the ground to minimize or avoid mistakes.\n\n\nOur Approach\n\n\nWe believe we are well positioned to extend our market leadership, not only through promoting the rapid adoption of our construction management platform, but also through our dedicated efforts to invest in and positively impact the future success of the construction community. We believe that our success is driven by the quality of our platform and our strong relationships with our customers and the broader construction industry. Our approach is based on two key elements:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nWe live and breathe construction.\n Our platform and products are focused on the construction industry, and we build our products for the requirements of industry stakeholders. We have deep domain expertise and an understanding of the construction industry\u2019s complex workflows, incentive structures, and the risks each stakeholder faces on a project. We also partner with the industry beyond providing software. Several of our initiatives, including \u201cJobsite,\u201d our industry-focused blog site, Procore Community, our online user community forum, and Groundbreak, our annual construction industry conference, are designed to grow community engagement across our platform. We also offer additional resources to the construction community, including certified continuing education courses, training programs, online content libraries, and free software to universities, schools, trade unions, and non-profits through our in-house social impact team, Procore.org.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nWe put our customers first.\n We make our products intuitive and easy-to-use, whether from a computer, smartphone, or tablet, in the field or in the back office, so that everyone can adopt and benefit from the power of our products. A core part of our strategy is our user-centric development culture. We engage with the construction community to understand its needs and work with our customers to develop, iterate, and improve our products and technology. Our customer support team provides live support to all users at no additional cost, as well as numerous online resources, because we believe that if all users are successful, then our customers will be successful.\n\n\nOur Platform\n\n\nOur platform is built to be modern, intuitive, and open with a modular and extensible architecture that not only includes the breadth and depth of functionality of our own products but also integrates with third-party applications and our customers\u2019 own customized applications. While we offer a broad set of products that we monetize through subscriptions, our platform includes a wide range of technical services that are shared across our products and open APIs that enable us to extend the capabilities of our platform to the broader ecosystem of software that our customers use.\n\n\nOur platform offers our customers and collaborators online and offline access to critical project information and capabilities that address a range of evolving needs throughout a project\u2019s lifecycle, including bidding, scheduling, building information modeling (\u201cBIM\u201d), labor tracking, financial management, and more. Our platform streamlines communication and facilitates compliance with safety and other regulatory standards, which helps increase productivity and efficiency, reduces rework and costly delays, improves safety and compliance, and enhances collaboration and accountability among key stakeholders.\n\n\nProduct Categories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nPreconstruction.\n Selecting the right specialty contractors and vendors for a construction project is critical to the successful outcome of the project. The process is often manual, disorganized, time-consuming and resource-intensive, requiring the collection of extensive documentation and multi-faceted bids that typically include sensitive information. Our Preconstruction products facilitate collaboration between internal and external stakeholders during the planning, budgeting, estimating, bidding, and partner selection phase of a construction project. Our products are designed to help reduce financial and operational risk across key stakeholders before construction begins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nProject Management.\n Construction teams struggle with poor communication between the field and office, time-consuming processes, and getting updated and accurate information to all project stakeholders. Teams often lack the ability to effectively collaborate on workflows, such as structure design, or changes to plans that become necessary in the field. Tracking project progress and ensuring procedures are in line with quality and safety standards is often manual or done using disparate point solutions. These dynamics lead to risky work environments, rework, training gaps, and strained relationships, often resulting in millions of dollars in cost overruns and litigation. Our Project Management products connect entire construction project teams by ensuring project information is aggregated in a cloud-based platform, available to all project participants, and accurate so that work on the jobsite is \n\n\n6\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncompleted correctly. Our products and platform enable real-time collaboration, information storage, design, BIM model clash detection, and regulation compliance for teams on the jobsite and in the back office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nResource Management.\n \nConstruction teams responsible for performing work on the jobsite are often unable to efficiently track labor productivity, which leads to schedule delays, inefficient use of time, margin loss, and rework. Our Resource Management product helps customers address these problems by allowing contractors to better schedule, track and forecast labor productivity, improve time management, communicate more efficiently with their workforces, and better manage profitability on construction projects. By using our products, customers are also creating detailed productivity records that can be referenced during the bidding process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nFinancial Management.\n Managing construction financials is often a slow, expensive, and manual data entry process. Construction teams need to be able to monitor budgets on individual projects and across entire portfolios of projects in order to maximize project profitability and plan for the long-term. Teams lack real-time access to accurate financial data that is critical to managing changes that impact budgets or allow for efficient invoicing. Traditionally, construction teams have not had access to collaborative financial applications that connect the field to the office. Our Financial Management products provide customers with visibility into the financial health of their individual construction projects and portfolios, and facilitate untethered access to financial data, linking the field and the office in real-time. Our products improve cost management, invoice collection and review, lien rights management, and budget forecasting and tracking. Our platform also supports integrations with a majority of the industry\u2019s preferred accounting systems.\n\n\nProcore App Marketplace\n\n\nOur platform gives customers the freedom to connect with third-party applications currently in our App Marketplace. Our App Marketplace extends the functionality of our existing products, connecting critical business workflows and processes, and enabling customers to maintain a single system of record while being able to leverage software solutions providing an array of functionality. This ecosystem provides customers with support in analytics, accounting, scheduling, compliance, and customer relationship management, among many other categories. While our customers may pay fees to certain third-party developers in order to use their applications that integrate with our platform, we do not earn any fees or commissions from either our customers or these third-party developers for accessing or using our App Marketplace.\n\n\nOur App Marketplace represents a key competitive differentiator for us and has been widely adopted by our customers, providing significant value while demonstrably increasing the stickiness of our products and providing a future pipeline for potential acquisitions. Within the construction industry, integration of third-party applications with our platform and a presence in the App Marketplace are increasingly seen as requirements for adoption and usage by our customer base.\n\n\nProcore Analytics\n\n\nOur analytics product offers advanced analytics and business intelligence capabilities, allowing customers to monitor projects and drive more informed decision-making for their business. Procore Analytics provides access to approximately 130 pre-built reports and the ability to build custom visualizations leveraging their enterprise data in Microsoft Power BI. Cross-tool reporting, configurable dashboards, and advanced data visualization all help turn project data into business insight.\n\n\nProcore Shared Technology Services\n\n\nOur platform includes a number of shared services that underlie our products and enable us to launch new products and extend the capabilities of our existing products. The user directory, reporting, tasks, search, and other components of our platform are examples of the underlying shared services that our customers can use across our products. In order to create a centralized hub for construction project information, we have developed an open and extensible platform that connects our customers\u2019 business applications, people, devices, and data. We have also developed highly configurable forms, data fields, and workflows, enabling our customers to centralize their data on our platform. Our platform services are designed around four defining attributes that increase the breadth and depth of our offering, improve usability, and enable a unified experience. These include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nUI Customization.\n Our platform is designed to be flexible and adaptable, providing native mobile and desktop user interfaces (\u201cUI\u201d) to both our internal and third-party developers. This means developers can accelerate design and development efforts by accessing Procore\u2019s core UI components and design guidelines helping ensure a consistent user experience. We also offer third-party developers the ability to create embedded applications, which we call Embedded Apps, a feature that allows developers to insert their apps directly into our UI. This creates an experience \n\n\n7\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthat reduces user friction and context switching between different applications, while providing our familiar UI to users when introducing new third-party applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nCustomizable Business Logic.\n Our products are designed to work the way our users work. Customers can create designated workflows to match the approval sequence and processes that are appropriate for their businesses. Our platform offers configurable fields and forms, improving the degree of precision with which customers can track data and secure documentation. Additionally, our platform offers comprehensive user permission functionality. These permissions define who has access to certain project and company-level information. By default, we provide customers with several role-based permission templates, and these permissions are configurable down to the tool access level by user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nAPIs.\n Our platform features developer-friendly open APIs and tools that are designed to empower our customers and third-party developers to build their own integrations or customized applications, thereby expanding the functionality of our products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nData.\n As data is generated on our platform, it is securely stored in centralized databases. Our platform enables our customers to search across their data, empowering real-time analytics and customizable reporting. Users have access to insights that can be derived from data generated by their account usage across our platform. Additionally, our platform allows us to collect aggregated, anonymized data that we can use to develop new products and features, as well as better support our customers as they navigate challenging industry and market conditions. We also expect to leverage this data to build artificial intelligence and machine learning functionality into the Procore platform in order to provide customers with ways to automate repetitive tasks, uncover hidden information, and glean actionable insights to drive better outcomes on projects, in addition to other next-generation features.\n\n\nOur platform typically serves as a system of record for our customers\u2019 projects, meaning that our customers are incentivized to continue to subscribe to our products even after the end of a construction project in order to leverage the benefits of Procore. As the number of projects and the construction volume managed on our platform grows, so does the amount of data that our platform captures. This enables our customers to analyze their data and derive insights to better operate their business.\n\n\nBenefits to Our Core Customer Stakeholders\n\n\nWe believe that our ability to deliver products that address our customers\u2019 specific needs while enabling streamlined communication and real-time access to data is essential to driving increased productivity and efficiency, improved safety and compliance, and enhanced collaboration and accountability.\n\n\nOwners\n\n\nOwners are the beneficiaries of the end result of a construction project, but if the project is over budget, or not completed on schedule, the owner can be responsible for funding the overage or incurring lost revenue. Owners need the ability to plan capital expenditures, accurately estimate project costs, source high quality general contractors to manage construction work, and track project progress with a high degree of visibility. By reducing friction that hinders collaboration, our products can help owners track cost updates, project status, and change orders. We help owners save significant time and money by providing financial and operational visibility into their projects. It is critical for owners\u2019 bottom lines that they remain informed of what work has been completed, when it was completed, and what specifically was built or installed. Not only is this information crucial for ongoing projects, but it is also necessary for long-term asset management, as the underlying data allows for more efficient, effective, and predictive maintenance.\n\n\nGeneral contractors\n\n\nGeneral contractors operate under immense pressure, with little room for error, as they often manage their businesses with small profit margins. Inadequate information flows, such as not providing specialty contractors with the latest set of plans, can result in costly project delays, overages, and unfulfilled expectations. General contractors are also compelled to perform duplicate data entry in disparate systems and are accustomed to dealing with invoicing errors, information silos, and disconnected point solutions. For example, general contractors must often collect and consolidate dozens of invoices from their specialty contractors each month before invoicing the owner. This process can require days or even weeks of effort, depending upon a project\u2019s complexity and the number of specialty contractors. With our platform, that process can be greatly condensed. We have developed a cloud-based platform to allow general contractors to manage their projects from a smart device in their hand, with the goal of facilitating exceptional teamwork, reducing costly rework, mitigating risk, and improving profit margins.\n\n\n8\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSpecialty contractors\n\n\nFor specialty contractors to be successful, it is imperative that they are able to effectively track and manage their crews, materials, and equipment. Specialty contractors have to get the right people to the right jobsite at the right time with the correct materials and equipment. However, specialty contractors often utilize disparate point software solutions or antiquated documentation systems, such as pen and paper and even physical whiteboards, which means they lack a consistent way to track labor production rates, monitor safety compliance and quality of work, ensure they are working off the latest set of plans and schedules, or document work completed as part of the invoicing process. Specialty contractors frequently experience delays and disruptions in work progress as a result of not having timely access to the most up-to-date information, such as when other stakeholders make changes to project plans or schedules and do not effectively communicate those changes to specialty contractors. For example, when a specialty contractor submits a change order, they typically cease work until the change order is approved by the owner and the decision is communicated back to the specialty contractor, which can take weeks. Our products feature intuitive, easy-to-use tools that allow specialty contractors to leverage accurate, real-time information, reduce unnecessary data entry, visualize productivity trends, document completed work, and get paid the correct amounts faster.\n\n\nOur Business Model\n\n\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to access our products and have an unlimited user model that is designed to facilitate adoption and maximize usage of our platform by all project stakeholders. We sell our products on a subscription basis for a fixed fee with pricing generally based on the number and mix of products and the annual construction volume contracted to run on our platform. As we grow, the value of our business increases across three key dimensions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nEcosystem.\n Our business model is designed to encourage rapid, widespread adoption by allowing for unlimited users, meaning we do not charge a per-seat or per-user fee. Customers can invite all project participants to engage with our platform as part of a project team. This includes the customer\u2019s employees and its collaborators, who are other project participants who engage with our platform but do not pay us for such use. Thereafter, collaborators have an incentive to become customers, as collaborators do not control what information they get access to, may not be able to access project information after a project is complete, and cannot run their complete portfolio of projects on our platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nProducts.\n We believe our expertise in construction and close relationship with our customers and collaborators enable us to deliver easy-to-use and feature-rich products, specifically tailored to solve the problems of the industry\u2019s key stakeholders and help them manage their businesses more effectively. Our products are offered \u00e0 la carte and are integrated into our cloud-based platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nData.\n Our platform captures extensive data across stakeholders and each stage of a project, which enables us to create a system of record for all stakeholders and to analyze project and industry trends. Our platform captures data encompassing bidding, safety, cost, quality, scheduling, materials, supplier information, and other types of data.\n\n\nOur Growth Strategy\n\n\nWe intend to leverage our existing products and industry presence to establish our platform and products as the industry standard in construction, both domestically and internationally. The key elements of our strategy to accomplish these objectives are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nMaintain and advance our technology leadership. \nWe believe the investments we have made in research and development to build our technology have been a core differentiator of our products and platform. We plan to continue to invest in technology innovation and product development, and we believe that our customers will benefit from new features and products that enable them to manage additional workflows on our centralized platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nAcquire new customers. \nWe believe the market for construction technology and collaboration tools is in its early phases of adoption. We plan to continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts to drive awareness of our products and grow our customer base, focusing on owners, general contractors, and specialty contractors. The portion of our current user base made up of collaborators invited to participate in our customers\u2019 projects represents a significant opportunity to increase our revenue. These users are incentivized to become customers in order to gain visibility and control across their projects with actionable insights from a single system. In the future, we have the potential to monetize additional adjacent stakeholders, including a broad set of industry participants who are potential customers of our existing products and those whom we plan to address with targeted new products over time.\n\n\n9\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nI\nncrease \nspend\n within our customer base. \nWe plan to drive additional spend from existing customers by capturing more projects, selling them additional existing products, and offering new products that address additional customer needs\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nExpand internationally. \nWe believe there is a global need for construction management software and that the global market is currently underpenetrated, representing a significant opportunity. We plan to open offices and hire sales and customer experience teams and expand our presence in the countries where we already operate, as applicable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nExtend our industry connectivity and our position as a trusted brand. \nWe believe there are powerful network effects to our business, and to capitalize on these effects we intend to focus on driving higher engagement with customers, collaborators, and the broader construction community. We will continue to invest in expanding our ecosystem, developing new partnerships, and supporting more integrations. In addition, we plan to continue to invest in growing our brand and expanding on our key community and user initiatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nPursue targeted acquisitions. \nWe have made and may in the future make select acquisitions to add innovative features and functionality to our platform, accelerate our end-to-end cloud-based platform strategy, and bring talent to our team. Our App Marketplace provides us with visibility into our customers\u2019 interactions with many third-party applications. For example, in 2019, we acquired Honest Buildings, Inc. (\u201cHonest Buildings\u201d), an existing App Marketplace partner and a provider of financial and project management software for owners, allowing us to further extend our products and platform to this key stakeholder group. In 2020, we acquired Esticom, another App Marketplace partner and provider of a leading estimating solution. In 2021, we acquired Levelset, a lien rights management solution, and LaborChart, a labor management solution, both of which were also existing App Marketplace partners. Our existing integrations with App Marketplace partners like these streamline the integration of their solutions into our platform post-acquisition and allows us to quickly deliver a seamless customer experience. We believe that our industry brand and App Marketplace provide us with an advantage in pursuing our acquisition strategy.\n\n\nOur Products\n\n\nOur platform features four integrated product categories, allowing data and workflows to transparently cross the phases of a construction project.

Our core customers are owners, general \n\n\n11\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\ncontractors, and specialty contractors operating across the commercial, residential, industrial, and infrastructure segments of the construction industry\n.\n\n\nSales and Marketing\n\n\nWe primarily sell subscriptions to access our products through our direct sales team, which is specialized by stakeholder region, size, and type, and is serviced regionally by offices in the United States, Canada, Australia, England, and Mexico, and by our focused sales and marketing efforts in Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, France, and Germany, where we do not yet maintain office locations. We combine an inside sales model with a field sales team targeting large accounts. Our install base team focuses on renewals and account expansion. Our construction volume-based pricing model and number of product offerings create multiple opportunities for expansion.\n\n\nWe focus our marketing efforts on product innovation and value, domain expertise, and community-building. We reach potential customers and generate leads for our sales team through a combination of content marketing, public relations, advertising, sponsorships, digital marketing, partner marketing, social media, community initiatives, and events. We deliver multi-touch marketing efforts across all stages of the customer journey, from awareness and consideration to purchase, retention, and advocacy.

We leverage our broad customer base, our engaged user communities, and our focus on user-driven innovation to aggregate feedback on features and functionality and consistently improve our products and platform. Our teams partner with our customers and collaborators to understand their needs through focus groups at our innovation labs, trade shows, and conferences, and with customers and collaborators on the jobsite.\n\n\nOur research and development teams are largely based in our Carpinteria, California headquarters, and our New York, New York and Austin, Texas offices.\n\n\nOur Competition\n\n\nThe market for construction management software is competitive and rapidly evolving. We believe the market is in its early phases of maturity and technology adoption as many companies in the construction industry still rely on a combination of rudimentary workflows, including manual paper-based methods, email, fax, and spreadsheet-based processes. Where technology has been adopted, it has generally had a limited impact because of a lack of modern, cloud-based tools, limited breadth and depth of functionality, or a lack of integrations between point solutions.\n\n\nWe believe our competitors primarily exist across the following four categories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\naggregated construction management tools\n, including products offered by Oracle, Autodesk, and Trimble. We integrate some of these companies\u2019 products with our platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\naccounting software vendors, \nincluding providers that offer accounting software and supplement their solutions with project management tools and other offerings, which are often bundled with their accounting solutions as lower-value add-ons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\npoint solution software vendors \nin various categories, including analytics, bidding, BIM, compliance, and scheduling, among others. Many of the point solutions these vendors provide integrate with our platform and are available in our App Marketplace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nin-house specialized tools or processes \nbuilt by or for existing or prospective customers.\n\n\nOur People and Our Values\n\n\nOur people are our strongest and most important asset in building and growing our business. We have worked hard to create and maintain a culture based on three core values:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nOpenness. \nWe define openness as \u201ca ready willingness to engage and express as well as to consider new information and ideas.\u201d We ask our employees to be honest without ego, which is represented by sharing critical \n\n\n12\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nopinions without fear of retribution, admitting when they don\u2019t know something, and including different voices and points of view. We believe that this diversity of thought makes us stronger and more innovative\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nOwnership. \nWe define ownership as \u201ca sense of having a personal stake in a project\u2019s or team\u2019s success and the feeling of empowerment and responsibility that goes with it.\u201d We ask our employees to take initiative and move forward, and in so doing, to vigorously advocate for our vision, to volunteer for work that challenges and inspires them, and to solicit feedback from leaders and colleagues. We also believe in providing equity incentives to our employees to foster an ownership mentality among them and align their interests with those of our stockholders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nOptimism. \nWe define optimism as \u201cthe ability to envision and pursue favorable outcomes \u2013 even in the face of challenges, and to believe in the capabilities and goodwill of oneself and others.\u201d We ask our employees to build toward the possible, which is represented by assuming positive intent in others, letting themselves have a bad day, and pursuing the rewards of hard work. We believe in embracing a growth mindset for continuous learning.\n\n\nWe believe that these three core values are foundational in building a high-performing, healthy company that scales. We also believe that having an open and inclusive work culture is integral to our ability to attract and retain exceptionally talented and motivated employees. \n\n\nWe continue to evolve our diversity, inclusion, and belonging initiatives with the goal of creating a culture of belonging for our employees and customers, and for other industry stakeholders. Our efforts are centered around three pillars: hiring, empowering and connecting, and industry outreach. We believe in increasing the diversity of our workforce, including hiring the best talent regardless of location. \n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 2,885 full-time employees, with 2,544 based in the United States and 341 in our international locations.\n\n\nOur Commitment to the Construction Industry\n\n\nWe have taken steps to create a more diverse and inclusive construction industry. Through our long-standing Women in Construction program, we advocate for improved gender equality and engage with a network of more than 12,000 supporters. As part of this effort, we host webinars, curate a virtual community group, and attend events across the country to connect advocates for the increased presence of women in construction. \n\n\nThrough our in-house social impact team, Procore.org, we invest in the industry by providing free access to Procore\u2019s software and training to 600 non-profit builders, educational institutions, and trade association training and apprenticeship centers. Last year, we launched a scholarship program with the Associated General Contractors of America to assist Black and other students of color who are studying in construction fields at Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\n \n\n\nOur Intellectual Property\n\n\nWe rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. As of December 31, 2021, we had 16 issued patents, 35 pending, non-provisional patent applications in the United States, and 11 active Patent Cooperation Treaty international patent applications. Our issued patents in the United States will expire between 2035 and 2040. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property.\n\n\nWe have trademark rights in our name, our logo, and other brand indicia, and have trademark registrations for select marks in the United States and many other jurisdictions around the world. We also have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business.\n\n\nWe intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. For additional information, see the sections titled \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Related to Our Business and Industry\u2014Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary information could diminish our brand and other intangible assets.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCorporate Information\n\n\nWe were incorporated as Butterfly Lane, Inc. in California in January 2002, and changed our name to Procore Technologies, Inc. in May 2002.

Risk Factors. \n\n\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto, before making a decision to invest in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\n\n\nWe have experienced rapid growth in recent periods, and such growth may not be indicative of our future growth. If we fail to properly manage future growth, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\n\n\nWe have experienced rapid growth in recent periods. Our revenue was $289.2 million in 2019, $400.3 million in 2020, and $514.8 million in 2021. Even if our revenue continues to increase, we expect that our revenue growth rate will decline in the future as a result of a variety of factors, including the maturation of our business. Our overall revenue growth depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nattract new customers and expand sales of subscriptions to our existing customers;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nincrease sales to owners and specialty contractors, as well as monetize additional new stakeholders;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ndevelop new products, further improve our existing products, and expand our App Marketplace with additional third-party applications;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nprovide our customers and collaborators with support that meets their needs;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ninvest financial and operational resources to support future growth in our customer, collaborator, and third-party relationships;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nexpand our operations domestically and internationally;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nretain and motivate existing personnel, and attract, integrate, and retain new personnel, particularly to our sales and marketing and engineering and product development teams;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nsuccessfully identify, acquire, and integrate businesses, products, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\neffectively plan for and model future growth; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ncompete with other providers of construction management software.\n\n\nIf we are not able to maintain revenue growth or accurately forecast future growth, we may not meet analyst expectations, which would likely cause a decline in our stock price. You should not rely on the revenue growth of any prior quarterly or annual period as an indication of our future performance.\n\n\nOur opportunity for future growth also depends on changes in our customers\u2019 budgetary constraints, regulatory and macroeconomic conditions, and economic conditions and business practices within the construction industry. To the extent we do not effectively address these risks, some of which are out of our control, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\n\n\nWe have a history of losses and may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\n\n\nWe have a history of losses, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. We incurred net losses of $83.1 million in 2019, $96.2 million in 2020, and $265.2 million in 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $662.2 million. We are not certain whether or when we will be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future. We also expect our expenses to increase in future periods as we continue to invest in growth, which could negatively affect our future results of operations if our revenue does not increase. In particular, we intend to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nexpanding our sales and marketing and customer success teams to drive new subscriptions, increase the use of our products and platform by existing customers, and support our international expansion;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nour technology infrastructure, including systems architecture, scalability, availability, performance, and security;\n\n\n15\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ninvestments in our engineering and product development teams and the development of new products and platform functionality;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nacquisitions, joint ventures, or strategic investments; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ngeneral administration, including increased legal and accounting expenses associated with being a public company.\n\n\nThese investments may not result in increased revenue or profitable growth. Any failure to increase our revenue as we invest in our business, or to manage our costs, could prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability or positive cash flow. We may also incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown events. If we are unable to successfully address these risks and challenges, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\n\n\nOur business may be significantly impacted by changes in the economy and related reductions in spend across the construction industry.\n\n\nOur business may be affected by changes in the economy. The construction industry in particular is impacted by economic slowdowns, tightening of economic policies, tariffs on imported goods, inflation, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, commodity prices, and policies that reduce government spending. Unfavorable or deteriorating market conditions, reductions in the rate of construction growth, decreases in lending activity, reductions in government spending and funding of infrastructure or other construction projects, government shutdowns, delays in the sale of voter-approved bonds, credit rating downgrades, reduced demand for public projects, and any resulting effects on spending by our customers or prospective customers, could have an adverse impact on our business. Our revenue may decrease because customers may generally choose to purchase less construction software in times of unfavorable economic conditions. Furthermore, if the construction industry experiences a decrease in overall construction volume, the amount our customers pay for our products could be reduced as we generally price our products based on a customer\u2019s annual construction volume, which is the fixed aggregate dollar volume of construction work contracted to run on our platform annually. To the extent we do not effectively address these risks and challenges, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\n\n\nThe construction management software industry is evolving and may not develop in ways we expect.\n\n\nThe construction management software industry is evolving. Widespread acceptance and use of construction management technology in general, and our platform in particular, is critical to our future growth and success. While we believe that our construction management software addresses a significant market opportunity, a viable market for it may never develop or it may develop more slowly than we expect. If a viable market for construction management software does not develop further or develops more slowly than we expect, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially adversely affected. Demand for construction management software in general, and our products in particular, is affected by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Some of these potential factors include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ngeneral awareness of construction management software;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\navailability, functionality, and pricing of products and services that compete with ours;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nnew construction methods that may be developed or become more prevalent in the future, including greater use of prefabrication methods;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ngovernment funding;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nease of adoption and use;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nfeatures and platform experience;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe reliability, performance, or perceived performance of our products and platform, including interruptions to the use of our products and platform;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe development and awareness of our brand; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nsecurity or data privacy breaches of our products or platform.\n\n\nIf we are unable to successfully address these potential factors, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\n\n\n16\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur current and future products and features may not be widely accepted by our customers, and we may not be able to respond to technological changes or changes in customer demands and preferences, or develop new products and functionality.\n\n\nOur ability to grow our customer base and increase revenue from customers will depend heavily on our ability to enhance and improve our platform, respond to changes in customer demands and preferences, introduce new products, and interoperate across an increasing range of devices, operating systems, and third-party applications. We may introduce significant changes to our existing products or develop and introduce new and unproven products, including technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience. Our customers may also demand features and capabilities that our current products do not have, or that our current platform cannot support, and we may need to invest significantly in research and development to build these features and capabilities. Any new products and features may fail to engage, retain, and increase our customer base or may suffer a lag in customer adoption. New products may initially suffer from performance and quality issues that may negatively impact our ability to market and sell such products to new and existing customers. Competitors may also develop and introduce new products or entirely new technologies to replace our existing products, which could make our platform obsolete or adversely affect our business. There is no assurance that any enhancements to our platform or new products, features, or capabilities will be compelling to our customers or gain market acceptance. Additionally, we may experience difficulties with software development, design, or marketing that could delay or prevent our development, introduction, or implementation of new products, features, or capabilities. We have in the past experienced delays in our internally planned release dates of new products, features, and capabilities, and there can be no assurance that new products, features, or capabilities will be released according to schedule. Any delays could result in adverse publicity, loss of revenue or market acceptance, or claims by customers brought against us, all of which could harm our business. If our research and development investments do not accurately anticipate user demand, or if we fail to develop our products, features, or capabilities in a manner that satisfies customer needs in a timely and cost-effective manner, we may fail to retain our existing customers or increase demand for our products, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\n\nWe are continuing to expand our operations outside the United States, where we may be subject to increased business, regulatory, and economic risks that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\n\nWe had customers running projects in over 150 countries as of December 31, 2021, and 15% of our revenue in 2021 was generated from customers outside the United States. As of December 31, 2020, we have established offices globally to support our sales and marketing efforts in the surrounding regions. We expect to continue to expand our international operations, which may include opening offices in new jurisdictions and providing our products in additional languages. Any new markets or countries into which we attempt to sell subscriptions to access our products may not be receptive to our efforts. For example, we may not be able to expand further in some markets if we are not able to adapt our products to fit the needs of prospective customers in those markets or if we are unable to satisfy certain government- and industry-specific laws or regulations. In addition, future international expansion will also require considerable management attention and the investment of significant resources while subjecting us to new risks and increasing certain risks that we already face, including risks associated with:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nrecruiting and retaining talented and capable employees outside the United States, including employees who speak multiple languages and come from a wide variety of different cultural backgrounds and customs;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nmaintaining our company culture across all of our global offices;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nproviding our products and platform in different languages and customizing them to support local requirements;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ncompliance with applicable international laws and regulations, including laws and regulations with respect to employment, construction, privacy, data protection, consumer protection, unsolicited email, and unauthorized practice of law, and the risk of penalties and fines against us and individual members of management or employees if our practices are deemed to be out of compliance;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nmanaging an employee base in jurisdictions with differing employment regulations;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\noperating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States and navigating the practical enforcement of such intellectual property rights outside of the United States;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe risk of changes in foreign laws that could restrict our ability to use our intellectual property outside of the foreign jurisdiction in which we developed it;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ncompliance by us and our partners with anti-corruption laws, competition laws, import and export control laws, tariffs, trade barriers, economic sanctions, and other regulatory limitations on our ability to provide our products or platform in certain international markets;\n\n\n17\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nforeign exchange controls that might require significant lead time in setting up operations in certain geographic territories and might prevent us from repatriating cash earned outside the United States;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\npolitical and economic instability (including as a result of COVID-19);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 or any other pandemics or epidemics that could result in decreased economic activity in certain markets, decreased use of our products and services, or in our decreased ability to sell our products and services to existing or new customers in international markets;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ngenerally longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\npotential double taxation of our international earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in the income and other tax laws of the United States or the international jurisdictions in which we operate; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nhigher costs of doing business internationally, including increased accounting, tax, travel, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs.\n\n\nCompliance with laws and regulations applicable to our global operations substantially increases our cost of doing business. We may be unable to keep current with changes in laws and regulations as they occur. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to support compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will always maintain compliance or that all of our employees, contractors, partners, and agents will comply. Any violations could result in enforcement actions, fines, civil and criminal penalties, damages, injunctions, or reputational harm. If we are unable to comply with these laws and regulations or manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, we may need to relocate or cease operations in certain foreign jurisdictions, which could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\n\nOur business depends on a strong brand, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, our ability to maintain and expand our customer base will be impaired, and our business will be harmed.\n\n\nWe believe that the Procore brand identity and awareness is critical to our sales and marketing efforts. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing the Procore brand is critical to maintaining and expanding our customer base and, in particular, conveying to customers and collaborators that our platform offers capabilities that address the needs of the construction ecosystem throughout the project lifecycle. We anticipate that, as our market becomes increasingly competitive, maintaining and enhancing our brand may become increasingly difficult and expensive. Any unfavorable publicity or perception of our products or platform or the providers of construction management software generally, could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to attract and retain customers. If we fail to promote and maintain the Procore brand, or if we incur increased expenses in this effort, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\n\n\nOur ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our products will significantly depend on our ability to develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities, the failure of which could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\n\nSales of subscriptions to access our products will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our sales and marketing capabilities. It is difficult to predict customer demand, customer retention and expansion rates, the size and growth rate of the market, the entry of competitive products, or the success of existing competitive products. Our sales efforts involve educating prospective customers about the uses and benefits of our products and platform. We expect that we will continue to need intensive sales efforts to educate prospective customers about the uses and benefits of our construction management software, and we may have difficulty convincing prospective customers of the value of adopting our products. We plan to continue expanding our salesforce, both domestically and internationally. Identifying, recruiting, and training qualified sales representatives is time-consuming and resource-intensive, and they may not be fully trained and productive for a significant amount of time following their hiring, if ever. In addition, the cost to acquire customers is high due to these considerable sales and marketing efforts. Our business will be harmed if our efforts do not generate a correspondingly significant increase in revenue. Even if we are successful in convincing prospective customers of the value of our products, they may decide not to purchase our products for a variety of reasons, some of which are out of our control. We spend substantial time and resources on our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will result in a sale. The failure of our efforts to secure sales after investing resources in a lengthy sales process could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n18\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe operate in a competitive market, and we must continue to compete effectively.\n\n\nThe market for our products is highly competitive and rapidly changing. Certain features of our current platform compete with:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\naggregated construction management products;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\naccounting software vendors;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\npoint solution software vendors in various categories, including analytics, bidding, BIM, compliance, and scheduling, among others; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nin-house specialized tools or processes built by or for existing or prospective customers.\n\n\nWith the introduction of new products, technologies, and market entrants in the construction management software industry, we expect competition to intensify in the future. Further, many of our actual and potential competitors benefit from competitive advantages over us, such as better name recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets, existing or more established relationships, greater third-party integration, access to larger customer bases, and greater financial, technical, pricing and marketing strategies, and other resources. Some of our competitors may make acquisitions or enter into strategic relationships with third parties to offer a broader range of products than we do. These combinations may make it more difficult for us to effectively compete. We expect these competitive dynamics to continue as competitors attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions.\n\n\nMany factors, including our marketing, user acquisition and technology costs, and our current and future competitors\u2019 pricing and marketing strategies, can significantly affect our pricing strategies. We currently sell our products at a premium as compared to some of our competitors. Certain competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or free products or services that compete with our products or may bundle and offer a broader range of products or services. We may not be able to compete at such lower price points or with such product configurations. Similarly, competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to acquire customers at a lower cost than we can. There can be no assurance that we will not be forced to engage in price-cutting initiatives or other discounts or to increase our marketing and other expenses, to attract and retain customers in response to competitive pressures, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\n\nOur results of operations may fluctuate significantly, which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our results of operations to fall below expectations.\n\n\nOur results of operations may vary significantly from period to period, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. We expect that our results of operations will vary as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nour ability to increase the number of new customers and retain and expand our existing customers\u2019 use of our products;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe timing and success of new products introduced by us or our competitors;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe budgeting cycles, government funding of projects, and purchasing practices of customers;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ngeneral economic conditions, both domestically and in foreign markets;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nreduction in construction spending in the public or private sectors;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nchanges in customer or collaborator requirements or market needs;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nchanges in the way we organize and compensate our employees;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nwhether the construction management software industry develops at all or develops more slowly than we expect;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nour ability to successfully expand our business domestically and internationally;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe timing and length of our sales cycles;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nour ability to complete sales transactions in a timely, predictable and effective manner, if at all;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nour ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain management and other skilled personnel;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the expansion of our business;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nchanges in the competitive landscape of our market, including consolidation among competitors or customers;\n\n\n19\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nchanges in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ninsolvency or credit difficulties affecting our customers\u2019 ability to purchase or pay for our products;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nsignificant security breaches of, technical difficulties with, or interruptions to, the use of our products or platform;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nunusual expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments or outcomes, or costs of responding to regulatory inquiries or actions;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nhealth epidemics or pandemics, such as COVID-19;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nfuture accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies or practices; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nincreases or decreases in our results caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\n\nIf we lose key management personnel or if we are unable to retain or hire additional qualified personnel, we may not be able to achieve our strategic objectives and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\n\n\nOur future success is substantially dependent on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate the members of our management team and other key personnel throughout our organization. In particular, we are highly dependent on the services of Mr. Courtemanche, our founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer, who is critical to our ability to achieve our vision and strategic priorities. We rely on our management team in the areas of operations, security, research and development, sales and marketing, support, and general and administrative functions. Although we have entered into offer letters with our key personnel, our employees, including our executive officers, work for us on an \u201cat-will\u201d basis, which means they may terminate their employment with us at any time. If Mr. Courtemanche or one or more of our key personnel or members of our management team resigns or otherwise ceases to provide us with their services, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\n\n\nOur continued success is also dependent on our ability to attract and retain other qualified personnel possessing a broad range of skills and expertise. There is significant competition for personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require across our product and platform development, sales, customer success, and general and administrative functions. In particular, to continue to enhance our products, develop new products, and add new and innovative functionality, it will be critical for us to continue to grow our research and development teams, including hiring highly skilled engineers, product managers, and designers with experience in designing, developing, and testing cloud-based software. We may need to offer higher compensation and other benefits to attract and retain key personnel in the future, and to attract top talent, we must offer competitive compensation packages before we have the opportunity to validate the productivity and effectiveness of new personnel. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater name recognition and financial resources. If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that we or these employees have breached the employee\u2019s legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources. Additionally, we may not be able to hire new personnel quickly enough to meet our needs. If we fail to meet our hiring needs or successfully integrate our new hires, our efficiency and ability to meet our forecasts and our employee morale, productivity, and retention could all suffer. Any of these factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\n\n\nWe are subject to stringent and changing obligations related to data privacy and security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could lead to regulatory investigations or actions, litigation, fines and penalties, disruptions of our business operations, reputational harm, loss of revenue or profits, loss of customers or sales, and other adverse consequences,\n \nany of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects .\n\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect, receive, store, generate, use, transfer, disclose, make accessible, protect, secure, dispose of, transmit, and share, which is collectively commonly referred to as \u201cprocessing\u201d, personal data and other sensitive information, including proprietary and confidential business data, trade secrets, intellectual property, sensitive third-party data, and personal data provided by our customers\u2019 users. Our data processing activities subject us to numerous data privacy and security obligations, such as various laws, regulations, guidance, industry standards, external and internal privacy and security policies, contracts, and other obligations that govern the processing of personal data by us and on our behalf. \n\n\nIn the United States, federal, state, and local governments have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including data breach notification laws, personal data privacy laws, and consumer protection laws. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d) imposes obligations on covered businesses. These obligations include, but are not limited to, providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording California residents certain rights related to their personal data. The CCPA allows for statutory fines for noncompliance (up to $7,500 per violation). In addition, it is anticipated \n\n\n20\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nthat the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (\u201cCPRA\u201d), effective January 1, 2023, will expand the CCPA. Additionally, the CPRA establishes a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the CPRA, which could increase the risk of enforcement.\n \nOther states have enacted data privacy laws\n as well\n.\n \nFor example, Virginia passed the Consumer Data Protection Act, and Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act, both of which become effective in 2023. Additionally, several states and localities have enacted measures related to the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in products and services. Data privacy and security laws have been proposed at the federal, state, and local levels in recent years, which could further complicate compliance efforts. \n\n\nOutside the United States, an increasing number of laws, regulations, and industry standards apply to data privacy and security. For example, the European Union\u2019s (\u201cEU\u201d) General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) and the United Kingdom\u2019s (\u201cU.K.\u201d) GDPR impose strict requirements for processing personal data. For example, under the EU\u2019s GDPR, government regulators may impose temporary or definitive bans on data processing, as well as fines of up to 20 million euros or 4% of annual global revenue, whichever is greater, for certain violations. In addition, individuals may initiate litigation related to processing of their personal data. Furthermore, in Europe, there is a proposed regulation related to artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) that, if adopted, could impose onerous obligations related to the use of AI-related systems. We may have to change our business practices to comply with such obligations. In Canada, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act and various related provincial laws, as well as Canada\u2019s Anti-Spam Legislation, applies to our operations, as does Australia\u2019s Privacy Act 1988. \n\n\nCertain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data transfer laws, which could make it more difficult to transfer information across jurisdictions (such as transferring or receiving personal data that originates in the EU or in other foreign jurisdictions). Existing mechanisms that facilitate cross-border personal data transfers may change or be invalidated.\n\n\n In addition, privacy advocates and industry groups have proposed, and may propose, standards with which we are legally or contractually bound to comply. For example, we are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (\u201cPCI DSS\u201d). PCI DSS requires companies to adopt certain measures to ensure the security of cardholder information, including using and maintaining firewalls, adopting proper password protections for certain devices and software, and restricting data access. Noncompliance with PCI-DSS can result in penalties ranging from $5,000 to $100,000 per month by credit card companies, litigation, damage to our reputation, and loss of revenue. We may also rely on vendors to process payment card data, who may also be subject to PCI DSS, and our business may be negatively impacted if our vendors are fined or suffer other consequences as a result of PCI DSS noncompliance. Our obligations related to data privacy and security are quickly changing in an increasingly stringent fashion, creating some uncertainty as to the effective future legal framework. Additionally, these obligations may be subject to differing applications and interpretations, which may be inconsistent or conflict among jurisdictions. Preparing for and complying with these obligations requires significant resources and may necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems, and practices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf. In addition, these obligations may require us to change our business practices.\n\n\nAlthough we endeavor to comply with all applicable data privacy and security obligations, we may at times fail, or be perceived to have failed, to do so. Moreover, despite our efforts, our personnel or third parties upon whom we rely may fail to comply with such obligations, which could negatively impact our business operations and compliance posture. For example, any failure by a third-party processor to comply with applicable law, regulations, or contractual obligations could result in adverse affects, including our inability to or interruption in our ability to operate our business and proceedings against us by governmental entities or others.\n\n\nIf we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data privacy and security obligations, we could face significant consequences. These consequences may include, but are not limited to, government enforcement actions (e.g., investigations, fines, penalties, audits, inspections, and similar), litigation (including class-related claims), additional reporting requirements and oversight, bans on processing personal data, orders to destroy or not use personal data, the inability to operate in certain jurisdictions, limited ability to develop or commercialize our products, loss of revenue or profits, loss of customers or sales, interruptions or stoppages in or modifications to our operations, negative publicity, and reputational harm, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. \n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf our information technology systems or data, or those of third parties upon which we rely, are or were compromised, we could experience adverse consequences resulting from such compromise, including but not limited to regulatory investigations or actions, litigation, fines and penalties, disruptions of our business operations, reputational harm, loss of revenue or profits, loss of customers or sales, and other adverse consequences, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we may process proprietary, confidential, and sensitive data, including personal data, intellectual property, and trade secrets (collectively, \u201csensitive information\u201d). We may rely upon third-party service providers and technologies to operate critical business systems to process sensitive information in a variety of contexts, including, without limitation, third-party providers of cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, and other functions. Our ability to monitor these third parties\u2019 information security practices is limited, and these third parties may not have adequate information security measures in place. We may share or receive sensitive information with or from third parties.  \n\n\nCyberattacks, malicious internet-based activity, and online and offline fraud are prevalent and continue to increase. These threats are also becoming increasingly difficult to detect and come from a variety of sources, including traditional computer \u201chackers,\u201d threat actors, personnel (such as through theft or misuse), sophisticated nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors. We and the third parties upon which we rely may be subject to a variety of evolving threats, including but not limited to social-engineering attacks (including through phishing attacks), malicious code (such as viruses and worms), malware (including as a result of advanced persistent threat intrusions), denial-of-service attacks (such as credential stuffing), personnel misconduct or error, ransomware attacks, supply chain attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, adware, telecommunications failures, and other similar threats. \n\n\nRansomware attacks, including by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors, are becoming increasingly prevalent and severe and can lead to significant interruptions in our operations, loss of data and income, reputational harm, and diversion of funds. While extortion payments have the potential to alleviate the negative impact of a ransomware attack, we may be unwilling or unable to make such payments for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to applicable laws or regulations prohibiting such payments. \n\n\nSimilarly, supply-chain attacks have increased in frequency and severity, and we cannot guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in our supply chain or our third-party partners\u2019 supply chains have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology systems (including our products and platform) or the third-party information technology systems that support us and our services. \n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and our remote workforce poses increased risks to our information technology systems and data, as more of our employees work from home, utilizing network connections outside our premises.\n\n\nAny of the previously identified or similar threats could cause a security incident or other interruption. A security incident or other interruption could result in unauthorized, unlawful, or accidental acquisition, modification, destruction, loss, alteration, encryption, disclosure of, or access to our sensitive information. A security incident or other interruption could disrupt our ability (and that of third parties upon whom we rely) to provide our products. We may expend significant resources or modify our business activities to try to protect against security incidents. Certain data privacy and security obligations may require us to implement and maintain security measures to protect our information technology systems and sensitive information.\n\n\nWhile we have implemented security measures designed to protect against security incidents, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective. We may be unable to detect past or future vulnerabilities in our information technology systems (including our products) because such threats and techniques change frequently, are often sophisticated in nature, and may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred. Furthermore, despite our efforts to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in our information technology systems (including our products), our efforts may not be successful. In addition, we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address any such identified vulnerabilities. Applicable data privacy and security obligations may require us to notify relevant stakeholders of security incidents. Such disclosures are costly, and the disclosures or the failure to comply with such requirements could lead to adverse consequences. \n\n\nIf we, or a third party upon whom we rely, experience a security incident or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we could experience significant consequences. These consequences may include, but are not limited to, government enforcement actions (e.g., investigations, fines, penalties, audits, and inspections), litigation (including class-related claims), additional reporting requirements and oversight, restrictions on processing sensitive information (including personal data), loss of revenue or profits, loss of customers or sales, interruptions or stoppages in or modifications to our operations (including \n\n\n22\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\navailability of data)\n,\n \nindemnification obligations, negative publicity, and reputational harm\n.\n Security incidents and attendant consequences may\n also\n cause customers to stop using our products, deter new customers from using our products and platform, and negatively impact our ability to grow and operate our business\n. \n\n\nOur contracts may not contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that limitations of liability in our contracts are sufficient to protect us from liabilities, damages, or claims related to our data privacy and security obligations. We cannot be sure that our insurance coverage will be adequate or sufficient to protect us from or to mitigate liabilities arising out of our data privacy and security practices, that such coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that such coverage will pay future claims.\n\n\nTo the extent we do not effectively address these risks, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\n\n\nAny failure to offer high quality support for our customers and collaborators may harm our relationships with our customers and, consequently, our business.\n\n\nWhile we have designed our products to be easy to adopt with minimal support, our customers depend on our customer success teams to provide implementation, training, and support services. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our in the field customer support capabilities have diminished as a number of our employees continue to work remotely to minimize their and our customers\u2019 risk of exposure to COVID-19. If we do not provide effective ongoing support (both virtually and in the field), our ability to sell additional products to existing customers could be adversely affected, and our reputation with prospective customers or the industry could be damaged. If we experience increased customer and collaborator demand for support, we may face increased costs that may harm our results of operations. The number of our customers and collaborators has grown significantly, which has put additional pressure on our customer success teams. If we are unable to provide efficient support services or if we need to hire additional support resources, potentially through third parties, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be adversely affected. Additionally, our ability to acquire new customers is highly dependent on our business reputation and on positive recommendations from existing customers. Any failure to maintain high quality support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high quality support, for our customers and collaborators could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\n\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over our financial reporting, including our acquired companies, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\n\n\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d). We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, make some activities more complex, time-consuming, and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources.\n\n\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight.\n\n\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business, including our acquisitions. In addition, changes in accounting principles or interpretations could also challenge our internal controls and require that we establish new business processes, systems, and controls to accommodate such changes. If these new systems or controls, and the associated process changes do not give rise to the benefits that we expect or do not operate as intended, it could adversely affect our financial reporting systems and processes, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial reports, or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, our business may be harmed if we experience problems with any new systems and controls that result in delays in their implementation or increased costs to correct any post-implementation issues that may arise.\n\n\n23\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFurther, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our business or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we \nwill \neventually be required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on our stock price. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the NYSE. We are not currently required to comply with the SEC rules that implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\n (\u201cSection 404\u201d)\n and are therefore not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for that purpose. As a public company, we will be required to provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting commencing with our second annual report on Form 10-K.\n\n\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could cause a decline in our stock price or materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had and could continue to have an adverse impact on our business, operations, and the markets and communities in which we, our partners, and our customers operate.\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused general business disruption worldwide beginning in January 2020. The potential impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business are difficult to assess or predict. Potential impacts include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nour customer prospects and our existing customers may continue to experience slowdowns in their businesses, which in turn may result in reduced demand for our platform, lengthening of sales cycles, loss of customers, and difficulties in collections;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nour employees are working from home much more frequently than they have historically, which may result in decreased employee productivity and morale, increased unwanted employee attrition, and increased risk of a cyberattack;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nwe continue to incur fixed costs, particularly for real estate, and may derive reduced or no benefit from those costs;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nwe may continue to experience disruptions to our growth planning, such as for facilities and international expansion;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nwe anticipate incurring costs in returning to work from our facilities around the world, including changes to the workplace, such as space planning, food service, travel costs, and amenities;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nwe may be subject to legal liability for safe workplace claims;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nour critical vendors or third-party partners could go out of business; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nin-person marketing events, including industry conferences, may be canceled or may be conducted remotely, which may not have the same level of effectiveness as marketing events and other sales and marketing activities conducted in person.\n\n\nThe impact of any of the foregoing, individually or collectively, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\n\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily closed our headquarters and other offices, required our employees and contractors to work remotely, and implemented travel restrictions, all of which represented a significant change in how we operate our business. The operations of our partners and customers have likewise been altered. As a result of global business disruption, the COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse impact on our ability to close new and additional business agreements. While the duration and extent of the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, it has had an adverse effect on the global economy and the ultimate societal and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic remains unknown. In particular, \n\n\n24\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nthe conditions caused by this pandemic are likely to\n continue to\n affect the rate of global construction spending and, despite the measures we have taken to limit or mitigate the impact, it could continue to have an adverse effect on the demand for our platform, lengthen our sales cycles, reduce the value or duration of subscriptions, reduce the level of subscription renewals, negatively impact collections of accounts receivable, reduce expected spending from new customers, cause some of our customers to go out of business, limit the ability of our direct sales force to travel to customers and potential customers, and affect contraction or attrition rates of our customers, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects in 202\n2\n and future periods.\n\n\nMoreover, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, including but not limited to, those related to our ability to increase sales to existing and new customers, develop and deploy new offerings and applications, and maintain effective marketing and sales capabilities.\n\n\nWe license technology from third parties and our inability to maintain those licenses could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\n\nWe currently incorporate, and will in the future incorporate, technology that we license from third parties into our products and platform. We cannot be certain that our licensors do not or will not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties or that our licensors have or will have sufficient rights to the licensed intellectual property in all jurisdictions where we may sell our platform. Some of our agreements with our licensors may be terminated by them for convenience, or otherwise provide for a limited term. If we are unable to continue to license technology because of intellectual property infringement claims brought by third parties against our licensors or against us, or if we are unable to continue our license agreements or enter into new licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to develop and sell products containing that technology would be limited, and our business could be harmed. Additionally, if we are unable to license or continue to license technology from third parties, such as technology that helps enable our products, we may be forced to acquire or develop alternative technology, which we may be unable to do in a commercially feasible manner or at all, and may require us to use alternative technology of lower quality or performance standards. This could limit or delay our ability to offer certain existing, new, or competitive products and may increase our costs. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\n\n\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary information could diminish our brand and other intangible assets.\n\n\nWe primarily rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures, licenses and contractual restrictions with our employees, consultants, and third parties, to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, all of which provide only limited protection. As of December 31, 2021, we had 16 issued patents, 35 pending, non-provisional patent applications in the United States, and 11 active Patent Cooperation Treaty international patent applications. Our issued patents in the United States will expire between 2035 and 2040. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. We make business decisions about when to seek patent protection for a particular technology and when to rely upon copyright or trade secret protection, and the approach we select may ultimately prove to be inadequate. Even when we seek patent protection, there is no assurance that the resulting patents will effectively protect every significant feature of our products or platform. In addition, we believe that the protection of our trademark rights is an important factor in product recognition, protecting our brand, and maintaining goodwill. If we do not adequately protect our rights in our trademarks from infringement, misappropriation and unauthorized use, any goodwill that we have developed in those trademarks could be lost or impaired, which could harm our brand and our business. Third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights, or may challenge our proprietary rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement without incurring substantial expenses. Additionally, pending and future patent, trademark, and copyright applications may not be approved, and our issued patents may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable, or invalidated. We have also devoted substantial resources to the development of our proprietary technologies and related processes. In order to protect our proprietary technologies and processes, we rely in part on trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, and third parties. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets, in which case we would not be able to assert trade secret rights, or develop similar technologies and processes. Further, laws in certain jurisdictions may afford little or no trade secret protection, and any changes in, or unexpected interpretations of, the intellectual property laws in any country in which we operate may compromise our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our products, platform, brand, and other intangible assets may be diminished, and competitors may be able to more \n\n\n25\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\neffectively replicate our platform and its features\n. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\n\nWe may become involved in litigation that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\n\nAs we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly higher profile, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims, commercial claims, or other claims or lawsuits being asserted against us grows. In the future, we may become a party to litigation and disputes related to our intellectual property, business practices, regulatory compliance, products, or platform. While we intend to vigorously defend these lawsuits, litigation can be costly and time-consuming, divert the attention of management and key personnel from our business operations, and dissuade prospective customers from subscribing to our products. We may need to settle litigation and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us, or we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversible upon appeal. The terms of any settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party. In addition, our customer agreements include provisions requiring us to indemnify our customers against liabilities if our products infringe a third-party\u2019s intellectual property rights, and we have negotiated other specific indemnities with certain of our customers, in each case, which could require us to make payments to such customers. During the course of any litigation or dispute, we may make announcements regarding the results of hearings and motions and other interim developments. If securities analysts and investors consider these announcements negative, our stock price may decline. With respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of third-party rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms and may significantly increase our operating expenses. A license to continue such practices may not be available to us, and we may be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology or practices or discontinue our practices. The development of alternative, non-infringing technology or practices could require significant effort and expenses. Any of the above could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\n\nIf we cannot maintain our company culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, teamwork, passion, and focus on execution that we believe contribute to our success.\n\n\nWe believe our corporate culture fosters innovation, teamwork, passion, and focus on execution and has contributed to our success. As we grow and develop our infrastructure as a public company and expand our operations, we may find it difficult to maintain our corporate culture. Any failure to preserve our culture could harm our future success, including our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel, innovate and operate effectively, and execute on our business strategies. In addition, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and local government health regulations, we are requiring or have required substantially all of our employees to work remotely to minimize the risk of exposure to the virus to our employees and the communities in which we operate. We may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, and business partners. There is no guarantee that we will be as effective while working remotely or that we will be able to maintain our corporate culture because our team is dispersed and because our employees may have less capacity to work due to increased personal obligations (such as childcare, eldercare, or caring for family members who become sick), may become sick themselves and be unable to work, or may be otherwise negatively affected, mentally or physically, by the COVID-19 pandemic and prolonged social distancing. If we experience any of these risks in connection with future growth, it could impair our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers and expand their use of our platform, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\n\nWe may be unsuccessful in making, integrating, and maintaining acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic investments.\n\n\nWe expect to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of businesses, joint ventures, new technologies, services, products, and other assets, and making strategic investments. However, we may not be able to find suitable acquisition, joint venture, and strategic investment candidates, and we may not be able to complete these transactions on favorable terms, or at all. Even if we are able to complete these transactions, they may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our strategic goals and could be viewed negatively by existing or prospective customers, collaborators, third-party developers, regulators, investors, or others. Any of these transactions could be material to our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\n\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of any or all of our acquisitions, joint ventures, or strategic investments in the time frame expected or at all. Valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly. Following any such transaction, we could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or other-than-temporary declines in fair value which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results through the write-off of goodwill and other impairment charges.\n\n\n26\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue securities, including equity-based securities, to pay for acquisitions, joint ventures, or strategic investments, each of which could affect our financial condition or the value of our capital stock. The sale of equity to finance any such transaction could result in dilution to our stockholders. If we incur debt in connection with such a transaction, it \nwould\n result in increased fixed obligations and could also subject us to covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to flexibly operate our business. Any of these factors could materially adversely affect our ability to consummate a transaction, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\n\nOur acquisition activities may disrupt our ongoing business, involve increased expenses, and present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions.\n\n\nWe have acquired and may continue to acquire companies, products, technologies and talent that complement our business strategy, both within and outside the U.S. Acquisitions, including our acquisitions of Levelset and LaborChart, involve significant risks and uncertainties, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe failure to successfully integrate the acquired technology, data assets, personnel, and operations into our business or to establish and maintain uniform and adequate standards, controls, policies, and procedures across the combined businesses;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe inability to realize synergies expected to result from an acquisition;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ndisruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nchallenges retaining key personnel, customers, vendors and other business partners of the acquired operation;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe risk that the internal control environment, including the cybersecurity environment, of an acquired company may not be consistent with our standards or with regulatory requirements, and may require significant time and resources to align and rectify;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nunidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence process, including product or service quality issues, intellectual property issues and legal contingencies;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe failure to successfully further grow an acquired business or further develop an acquired technology and any resulting impairment of amounts currently capitalized as intangible assets;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe increased operating expenses may negatively affect our financial results;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nrisks associated with businesses we acquire that may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nin the case of foreign acquisitions or acquisitions containing foreign operations, the impact of particular economic, tax, currency, political, legal, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nto the extent we issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition, current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership and earnings per share will be diluted.\n\n\nIn addition, any acquisition that we announce may not be completed if closing conditions are not satisfied. Because acquisitions are inherently risky, our transactions may not be successful and may, in some cases, harm our operating results or financial condition. In particular, if we are unable to successfully operate as a combined business, including in respect of the LaborChart and Levelset acquisitions, or any other interests that we acquire, to achieve shared growth opportunities or combine reporting or other processes within the expected time frame, such delay may materially and adversely affect the benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of any such acquisition, and could result in additional costs or loss of revenue. Moreover, adverse changes in market conditions and other factors, such as the failure to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of either of the LaborChart or Levelset acquisitions and the impact of COVID-19, may cause the acquisition to be dilutive to our operating earnings per share beyond the first fiscal year after close. Any dilution of our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share could cause the price of our common stock to decline or grow at a reduced rate.\n\n\nOur business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations, many of which are evolving, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\n\nWe are subject to a number of laws and regulations that apply generally to businesses, including laws and regulations governing the internet and the marketing, sale, and delivery of goods and services over the internet. These laws and regulations, which continue to evolve, cover, among other things, taxation, tariffs, privacy and data protection, data security, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, mobile and other communications, advertising practices, electronic contracts, sales procedures, automatic subscription renewals, credit card processing procedures, consumer protection, the provision of online \n\n\n27\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\npayment services, the design and operation of websites, and the characteristics and quality of products that are offered online. We cannot guarantee that we have been or will in the future be fully compliant with such laws and regulations in every jurisdiction, as it is not entirely clear in every jurisdiction how existing laws and regulations governing such areas apply or will be enforced. Moreover, as the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, increasing regulation and enforcement efforts by federal, state, and foreign authorities, and the prospects for private litigation claims, become more likely. In addition, the adoption of new laws or regulations, or the imposition of other legal requirements, that adversely affect our ability to market or sell our products could harm our ability to offer, or customer demand for, our products, which could impact our revenue, impair our ability to expand our product offerings, and make us more vulnerable to competition.\n \nFuture regulations, or changes in laws and regulations or their existing interpretations or applications, could also require us to change our business practices and raise compliance costs or other costs of doing business. For example, the re-adoption of \u201cnetwork neutrality\u201d rules in the United States by the Federal Communications Commission\n (\nthe \n\u201c\nFCC\n\u201d)\n, which the current president of the United States supported during his \ncampaign,\n and which is supported by the current Democratic FCC commissioners, could affect the services we and our customers use by restricting the offerings made by internet service providers or reducing their incentives to invest in their networks. After a federal court judge denied a request for an injunction against California\u2019s state-specific network neutrality law, California began enforcing that law on March 25, 2021\n. T\nrade associations representing internet service providers appealed the district court\u2019s ruling denying the preliminary injunction, and the appeal was denied on January 28, 2022\n. \nThe trade associations have sought rehearing with the full court of appeals. Other\n states could begin to enforce existing laws or adopt new network neutrality requirements. In addition, our materials finance business, which we assumed in connection with the \nLevelset\n acquisition, may be subject to additional federal and state laws and regulations governing extensions of credit and other financial transactions. We believe that the transactions in which our materials finance business engages generally are not subject to laws or regulations governing loans and lending activities. However, if a regulator or court concluded that such transactions are loans, and thus subject to laws governing loans and lending activities, then we may be required to restructure the transactions in a way that is commercially less desirable in order to support the credit sale characterization, or to comply with laws and regulations governing loans and lending activities, which may include usury laws and state lending, loan brokering, or debt collection or servicing licensing laws.\n\n\nAdditionally, various federal, state, and foreign labor laws govern our relationships with our employees and affect operating costs. These laws include employee classifications as exempt or non-exempt, minimum wage requirements, unemployment tax rates, workers\u2019 compensation rates, overtime, family leave, workplace health and safety standards, payroll taxes, citizenship requirements, and other laws and regulations.\n\n\nAny claim, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation, inquiry or request under any of the foregoing could: (i) result in reputational harm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products or services, (ii) limit our access to credit, (iii) result in a modification or suspension of our business practices, (iv) require us to develop non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies, (v) prompt ancillary claims, lawsuits, proceedings, investigations, inquiries or requests, (vi) consume financial and other resources which may otherwise be utilized for other purposes, such as advancing other products and services on our platform, (vii) cause a breach or cancelation of certain contracts, or (viii) result in a loss of customers, investors or partners. Any of the foregoing, or any significant \nadditional laws or regulations, or our failure to comply with any laws and regulations that now or in the future could apply to our business, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\n\n\nCertain of our services subject us to complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding the unauthorized practice of law.\n\n\nUnauthorized practice of law (\u201cUPL\u201d) generally refers to an entity or person who is not licensed to practice law but who gives legal advice or advertises their services as the practice of law. As a result of our acquisition of Levelset in November 2021, certain lien rights management services we now offer involve activities that could represent an alternative to traditional legal services and, as a result, may potentially subject us to UPL allegations. Our lien rights management business model includes the provision of document-processing services in connection with the filing of liens. In the past, various aspects of Levelset\u2019s lien rights management offering have been subject to claims of UPL. In the future, we could face similar claims, actions, or proceedings.\n\n\nThe laws and regulations that define UPL, and the governing bodies that enforce UPL rules, differ among the various jurisdictions in which we operate, and the scope of these laws and regulations is often vague and broad and are evolving. As a result, the applications and interpretations of these laws and regulations can be uncertain and conflicting. For example, regulation of legal document processing, a component of our lien rights management offering, varies among the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Compliance with these disparate laws and regulations may require us to structure our business and services differently in certain jurisdictions, which could lead to operating inefficiencies. Maintaining compliance with UPL \n\n\n28\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nrules across various jurisdictions may cause us to incur significant expenses and may require that we dedicate significant management time to dealing with UPL issues, which could divert management\u2019s attention from other matters. \n\n\nAs we continue to grow our lien rights management offering or expand into new jurisdictions, we may face increased scrutiny and risk of additional UPL claims, actions or proceedings. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable UPL laws and regulations may subject us to regulatory inquiries, actions, lawsuits or proceedings. Levelset has incurred in the past, and we expect to incur in the future, costs associated with responding to, defending, resolving, and/or settling UPL claims, actions, and proceedings. We can give no assurance that we will prevail in any such matters on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Responding to, defending and/or settling regulatory inquiries, action, lawsuits and proceedings may be time-consuming and divert management and financial resources or have other adverse effects on our business. A negative outcome in any of these proceedings may result in claims, actions, changes to or discontinuance of some of our services, potential liabilities, and additional costs that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, future prospects, and brand.\n\n\nWe may need to raise additional capital to grow our business, and such capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could reduce our ability to compete and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\n\nWe expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. To support our business and operations, we will need sufficient capital to continue to make significant investments, and we may need to raise additional capital through equity or debt financings to fund such efforts. If such financing is not available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to fund our growth or develop new business at the rate desired, and our operating results may suffer. Debt financing increases expenses, may contain covenants that restrict the operation of our business, and must be repaid regardless of operating results. For example, covenants contained in our existing Credit Facility with Silicon Valley Bank (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) limit our ability to pay dividends, to create, incur, or assume indebtedness or liens, to consummate certain strategic transactions, to engage in transactions with affiliates, and to make certain investments. Equity financing, or debt financing that is convertible into equity, could result in dilution to our existing stockholders and a decline in our stock price.\n\n\nOur inability to obtain adequate capital resources, whether in the form of equity or debt, to fund our future growth may require us to delay, scale back, or eliminate some or all of our operations or the expansion of our business, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\n\n\nIf customers default on deferred payment terms under supply contracts with our materials finance business, we may incur financial losses or be unable to obtain favorable terms from potential funding sources we may pursue in the future.\n\n\nIn connection with our acquisition of Levelset in November 2021, we assumed a materials finance line of business, pursuant to which we acquire construction materials from suppliers and allow our customers to finance their purchases of such materials from us on deferred payment terms. Holding these receivables under the deferred payment terms in our materials supply agreements on our balance sheet exposes us to credit and liquidity risk, which may adversely affect our financial performance. If customers default on the deferred payment terms under our materials supply agreements, we may incur financial losses or be unable to obtain favorable terms from potential funding sources we may pursue in the future.\n\n\nWhile we earn financing charges on deferred payment balances, we bear credit risk in the event customers default on the deferred payment terms under our materials supply agreements. Further, adverse effects on our liquidity may impair our ability to allocate sufficient financial resources for other purposes, such as advancing any other aspect of our platform, which could adversely impact our results of operations. \n\n\nAlthough we believe that we currently have adequate liquidity to support our materials finance business, there are a number of factors that could reduce or deplete our existing liquidity position, including results of operations that are reduced relative to our projections, costs related to existing or future litigation or regulatory matters, the pursuit of strategic business opportunities (whether through acquisition or otherwise), and unanticipated liabilities.\n\n\n29\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe rely on third-party data centers, such as AWS, to host and operate our platform, and any disruption of or interference with our use of these resources may negatively affect our ability to maintain the performance and reliability of our platform, which could cause our business to suffer.\n\n\nOur customers depend on the continuous availability of our platform. We currently host our platform and serve our customers primarily using Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d). Consequently, we may be subject to service disruptions as well as failures to provide adequate support for reasons that are outside of our control, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe performance and availability of AWS and other third-party providers of cloud infrastructure services with the necessary speed, data capacity, and security for providing reliable services;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ndecisions by AWS and other owners and operators of the data centers where our cloud infrastructure is deployed to terminate our subscriptions, discontinue services to us, shut down operations or facilities, increase prices, change service levels, limit bandwidth, declare bankruptcy, or prioritize the traffic of other parties;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nphysical break-ins, acts of war or terrorism, database capacity constraints, human error or interference, including by disgruntled employees, former employees, or contractors, and other catastrophic events; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ncyberattacks, including denial of service attacks, targeted at us, our data centers, or the infrastructure of the internet.\n\n\nThe adverse effects of any service interruptions on our reputation, results of operations, and financial condition may be disproportionately heightened due to the nature of our business and the fact that our customers have a low tolerance for interruptions of any duration.\n\n\nTo meet the performance and other requirements of our customers, we intend to continue to make significant investments to increase capacity and to develop and implement new technologies in our cloud infrastructure operations. Any renegotiation or renewal of our agreement with AWS, or a new agreement with another provider of cloud-based services, may be on terms that are significantly less favorable to us than our current agreement. Additionally, these new technologies, which include databases, application and server optimizations, network strategies, and automation, are often advanced, complex, new, and untested, and we may not be successful in developing or implementing these technologies. It takes a significant amount of time to plan, develop, and test improvements to our technologies and cloud infrastructure, and we may not be able to accurately forecast demand or predict the results we will realize from such improvements. To the extent that we do not effectively scale our infrastructure to meet the needs of our growing customer base and maintain performance as our customers expand their use of our products, or if our cloud-based server costs were to increase, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\n\n\nThe experience of our users depends upon the interoperability of our platform across devices, operating systems, and third-party applications that we do not control.\n\n\nOne of the most important features of our platform is its broad interoperability with a range of devices, web browsers, operating systems, and third-party applications. Our App Marketplace enables customers to connect other software, applications, and data to our platform. Accordingly, we are dependent on the accessibility of our platform across web browsers, operating systems, and the third- party applications that we oftentimes do not control. Third-party applications and products are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to modify our platform to assure its compatibility with that of other third parties following development changes. In addition, some of our competitors may be able to disrupt the operations or compatibility of our platform with their applications that some of our customers may rely upon. If our platform has integration or operability failures with these operating systems or third-party applications, customers may not adopt our platform, and our App Marketplace may not be useful to customers, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\n\n\nInterruptions or performance issues associated with our products and platform could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\n\nWe have experienced, and may in the future experience, service interruptions and other performance issues due to a variety of factors. Our future growth depends in part on the ability of our existing and prospective customers to access our products and platform reliably and at any time. Certain of our customer agreements contain service level commitments, which contain specifications regarding the availability and performance of our platform. If we are unable to meet our stated service level commitments or if we suffer extended periods of poor performance or unavailability of our platform, we may be contractually obligated to provide affected customers with service credits against existing subscriptions or, in certain cases, refunds. Any service interruptions or other performance issues could negatively impact our renewal rates and harm our ability to attract new customers, and as a result could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\n\n30\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdditionally, our products and platform are inherently complex and may, from time to time, contain material defects or errors, particularly when new products or new features or capabilities are released. We have in the past found defects or errors in our products and platform and we may detect new defects or errors in the future. Any real or perceived errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs in our products or platform could result in negative publicity or lead to data security, access, retention, or performance issues, all of which could harm our business and reputation. In addition, the costs incurred in correcting such defects or errors may be substantial. Any of these risks could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\n\nFailures in internet infrastructure or interference with internet or Wi-Fi access could cause existing or prospective users to believe that our systems are unreliable, potentially leading our customers to decline to renew their subscriptions.\n\n\nOur platform depends on our users\u2019 internet access. Increasing numbers of users on our platform and increasing bandwidth requirements may degrade the performance of our products or platform due to capacity constraints and other internet infrastructure limitations. If internet service providers and other third parties providing internet services have outages or deteriorations in their quality of service, our users may not have access to our platform or may experience a decrease in the quality of our products. Furthermore, as the rate of adoption of new technologies increases, the networks our platform relies on may not be able to sufficiently adapt to any increased demand for our products. Frequent or persistent interruptions, including those from increased usage stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, could cause existing or prospective users to believe that our platform is unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\n\nIn addition, users who access our platform through mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, must have an internet or Wi-Fi connection to use our products. Currently, this access is provided by a limited number of companies. These providers could take measures that degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to third-party services, including our platform, by charging increased fees to third parties or the users of third-party services, any of which would make our platform less attractive to customers and reduce our revenue.\n\n\nIncreased government scrutiny of the technology industry could negatively affect our business.\n\n\nThe technology industry is subject to intense media, political, and regulatory scrutiny, which may expose us to government investigations, legal actions, and penalties. Various regulatory agencies, including competition, consumer protection, and privacy authorities, have active proceedings and investigations concerning multiple technology companies, some of which have offerings, like app marketplaces and collaboration tools, that are similar to services and features we offer. If proceedings or investigations targeted at other companies result in determinations that practices are unlawful, we could be required to change our products and services or alter our business operations, which could harm our business. Legislators and regulators also have proposed new laws and regulations intended to restrain the activities of technology companies. If such laws or regulations are enacted, they could adversely impact us, even if they are not intended to affect our company. In addition, the introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. The increased scrutiny of acquisitions in the technology industry also could affect our ability to enter into strategic transactions or to acquire other businesses. Compliance with new or modified laws and regulations could increase the cost of conducting the business, limit the opportunities to increase our revenues, or prevent us from offering products or services.\n\n\nOur liability for third-party content on our platform, such as content posted by customers and other users, currently is limited by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. There have been various efforts made by state and federal executives and legislators to bypass, eliminate, or modify Section 230, which limits the liability of internet platforms for third-party content that is transmitted via those platforms and for good- faith moderation of offensive content. President Biden and many members of Congress from both parties have expressed support for the reform or repeal of Section 230, so the possibility of Congressional action remains. In addition, the FCC is considering a petition, filed by the former administration, to adopt rules interpreting Section 230. If the FCC adopts rules, the scope of the protection afforded by Section 230 could be narrowed considerably. The FCC has not released any document describing the rules that would be proposed and no date has been set for a vote on any such proposal. The Democratic commissioners of the FCC have indicated that they are opposed to the petition and now control the agenda of the FCC. In addition, Florida and Texas have passed laws intended to limit the protection afforded by Section 230, and similar legislation has been introduced in other states. In response to challenges from industry groups, federal courts have enjoined enforcement of the Florida and Texas laws, but appeals are pending in both cases. There also are pending cases before the judiciary that may result in changes to the protections afforded to internet platforms, including a lawsuit by former President Trump that, if successful, would greatly limit the scope of Section 230. We cannot predict whether there will be any changes to Section 230 or if regulatory action will interpret it in such a way as to limit the protection it affords. If the protections contained in Section 230 are repealed or limited, we could be subjected to liability for \n\n\n31\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nour customers\u2019 or other users\u2019 activities, or we could be required to pay fines or penalties, redesign our business methods, or otherwise expend resources to remedy any damages caused by such actions and to avoid future liability. Even if claims asserted against us do not result in liability, we may incur substantial costs in investigating and defending such claims\n.\n\n\nWe also could be harmed by government investigations, litigation, or changes in laws and regulations directed at our business partners, or suppliers in the technology industry that have the effect of limiting our ability to do business with those entities. For example, the U.S. government recently has taken action against companies operating in China intended to limit their ability to do business in the U.S. or with U.S. companies. There can be no assurance that our business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation, or changes to laws and regulations in the future.\n\n\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in compliance with applicable laws.\n\n\nOur products and platform are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export control and sanctions laws and regulations, including the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Export Administration Regulations, and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control. The U.S. export control laws and U.S. economic sanctions laws include restrictions or prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons, and entities, identified by the United States, and also require authorization for the export of certain encryption items. Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain cloud- based solutions to countries, governments, and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted or could enact laws that could limit our ability to distribute our platform or limit our ability to implement our platform in those countries. While we have implemented certain procedures to facilitate compliance with applicable laws and regulations in connection with the collection of this information, we cannot assure you that these procedures have been effective or that we, or third parties, many of whom we do not control, have complied with all laws or regulations in this regard. Failure by our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, agents, intermediaries, or other third parties to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the collection of this information also could have negative consequences to us, including reputational harm, government investigations, and penalties.\n\n\nAlthough we take precautions to prevent our information collection practices from being in violation of such laws, our information collection practices may have been in the past, and could in the future be, in violation of such laws. If we or our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, agents, intermediaries, or other third parties fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export privileges and fines and penalties. We may also be adversely affected through other penalties, reputational harm, loss of access to certain markets, or otherwise. Obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular transaction may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. While we are working to implement additional controls designed to prevent similar activity from occurring in the future, these controls may not be fully effective.\n\n\nChanges in our platform, or changes in sanctions and import and export laws, may delay the introduction and sale of subscriptions to access our products in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from using our platform, or in some cases, prevent the access or use of our platform to and from certain countries, governments, persons, or entities altogether. Further, any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related laws, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our platform or in our decreased ability to export or sell our platform to existing or prospective customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our platform could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\n\nWe are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (\u201cBribery Act\u201d), and other anti-corruption, sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, and similar laws in the United States and other countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption and anti- bribery laws, which have been enforced aggressively and are interpreted broadly, prohibit companies and their employees, agents, intermediaries, and other third parties from promising, authorizing, making, or offering improper payments or other benefits to government officials and others in the private sector. In the future, we may leverage third parties, including intermediaries, agents, and partners, to conduct our business in the United States and abroad, to sell subscriptions. We and these third parties may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities, and we may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party partners and intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, agents, intermediaries, and other third parties, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. While we have policies and \n\n\n32\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nprocedures to address compliance with FCPA, Bribery Act, and other anti-corruption, sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, and similar laws, we cannot assure you that they will be effective, or that all of our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, agents, intermediaries, or other third parties have taken, or will not take actions, in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. As we increase our international sales and business, our risks under these laws may increase. Noncompliance with these laws could subject us to investigations, severe criminal or civil sanctions, settlements, prosecution, loss of export privileges, suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, and other consequences. Any investigations, actions, or sanctions could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects\n.\n\n\nOur use of third-party open source software could negatively affect our ability to sell subscriptions to access our products and subject us to possible litigation.\n\n\nWe use third-party open source software. From time to time, companies that use third-party open source software have faced claims challenging the use of such open source software and compliance with the open source software license terms. Accordingly, we may be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming non-compliance with the applicable open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require end-users, who distribute or make available across a network software and services that include open source software, to make publicly available or to license all or part of such software (which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code, such as modifications or derivative works created, based upon, incorporating, or using the open source software) under the terms of the particular open source license. While we employ practices designed to monitor our compliance with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we may inadvertently use third-party open source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the terms of the applicable license, including claims of intellectual property rights infringement or for breach of contract. Furthermore, there exists today an increasing number of types of open source software licenses, almost none of which have been tested in courts of law to provide clarity on their proper legal interpretation. If we were to receive a claim of non-compliance with the terms of any of these open source licenses, we may be required to publicly release certain portions of our proprietary source code. We could also be required to expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software. Any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\n\nIn addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the functionality or origin of the software. Use of open source software may also present additional security risks because the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise our platform. Any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects and could help our competitors develop products and services that are similar to or better than ours.\n\n\nOur customers\u2019 and other users\u2019 violation of our policies or other misuse of our platform to transmit unauthorized, offensive, or illegal messages, spam, phishing scams, and website links to harmful applications or for other fraudulent or illegal activity could damage our reputation, and we may face a risk of litigation and liability for illegal activities on our platform and unauthorized, inaccurate, or fraudulent information distributed via our platform.\n\n\nDespite our ongoing and substantial efforts to limit such use, certain customers or other users may use our platform to transmit unauthorized, offensive, or illegal messages, calls, spam, phishing scams, and website links to harmful applications, reproduce and distribute copyrighted material or the trademarks of others without permission, and report inaccurate or fraudulent data or information. These actions are in violation of our policies. However, our efforts to defeat spamming attacks, illegal robocalls, and other fraudulent activity will not prevent all such attacks and activity. Such use of our platform could damage our reputation and we could face claims for damages, regulatory enforcement, copyright or trademark infringement, defamation, negligence, or fraud. Moreover, our customers\u2019 and other users\u2019 promotion of their products and services through our platform might not comply with federal, state, and foreign laws. We rely on contractual representations made to us by our customers that their use of our platform will comply with our policies and applicable law. Although we retain the right to verify that customers and other users are abiding by our policies, our customers and other users are ultimately responsible for compliance with our policies, and we do not systematically audit our customers or other users to confirm compliance with our policies. Although Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act currently limits liability for third-party content posted on internet platforms, we cannot predict whether that protection will remain in effect. See the risk factor titled \u201cIncreased government scrutiny of the technology industry could negatively affect our business.\u201d\n\n\n33\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBecause we recognize revenue from subscriptions to access our products over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business will not be immediately reflected in our results of operations.\n\n\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to access our products. We recognize revenue ratably over the term of the subscription, beginning on the date that access to our products is made available to our customer. Our subscriptions generally have annual or multi-year terms. As a result, the significant majority of our revenue is generated from subscriptions entered into during previous periods. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not significantly reduce our revenue for that quarter but could negatively affect our revenue in future periods. Accordingly, the effect of downturns or upturns in new sales and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our revenue recognition model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through new subscriptions in any period.\n\n\nOur ability to recognize revenue may also be affected by the length and unpredictability of the sales cycle for our products, especially with respect to larger enterprises and owners. Such customers typically undertake a significant evaluation and negotiation process due to their leverage, size, organizational structure, and approval requirements, all of which can lengthen our sales cycle. We may spend substantial time, effort, and money on sales efforts to such customers without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales or that these customers will deploy our platform widely enough across their business to justify our substantial upfront investment. As a result, we anticipate increased sales to large enterprises will lead to higher upfront sales costs and greater unpredictability, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\n\n\nIn addition, as required by the recent revenue recognition standard under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, \nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n, we disclose the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations. It is possible that analysts and investors could misinterpret our disclosure or that the terms of our customer subscriptions or other circumstances could cause our methods for calculating this disclosure to differ significantly from others, which could lead to inaccurate or unfavorable forecasts by analysts and investors.\n\n\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, floods, and other natural catastrophic events.\n\n\nOur corporate headquarters are located near Santa Barbara, California, a region known for seismic activity and severe fires, and our insurance coverage may not compensate us for losses that may occur in the event of an earthquake or other significant natural disaster, such as a fire, mudslide, flood, or significant power outage. A significant natural disaster could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. In addition, climate change could result in an increase in the frequency or severity of natural disasters and cause performance problems with our technology infrastructure and cause business interruption.\n\n\nAlthough we maintain incident management and disaster response plans, in the event of a major disruption caused by a natural disaster or man-made problem, or outbreaks of pandemic diseases, including COVID-19, we may be unable to continue our operations and may experience system interruptions and reputational harm. Acts of terrorism and other geo-political unrest, including the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, could also cause disruptions in our business or the business of our customers, partners, vendors, or the economy as a whole. All of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if our disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate.\n\n\nIf we experience excessive fraudulent activity or cannot meet evolving credit card association merchant standards, we could incur substantial costs and lose the right to accept credit cards for payment, which could cause our customer base to decline significantly and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\n\nA portion of our customers authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for our products. If customers pay for their subscriptions with unauthorized credit cards, we could incur substantial third- party vendor costs for which we may not be reimbursed. Further, our customers provide us with credit card billing information online or over the phone, and we do not review the physical credit cards used in these transactions, which increases our risk of exposure to fraudulent activity. We have also incurred charges, which we refer to as chargebacks, from the credit card companies for claims that the customer did not authorize the credit card transaction for our products. If the number of claims of unauthorized credit card transactions becomes excessive, we could be assessed substantial fines for excess chargebacks, and we could lose the right to accept credit cards for payment. In addition, credit card issuers may change merchant standards, including data protection and documentation standards, required to utilize their services from time to time. If we fail to maintain compliance with current merchant standards or fail to meet new standards, the credit card associations could fine us or terminate their agreements with us, and we would be unable to accept credit cards as payment for our products. We may be required to pay for unauthorized credit charges and expenses with no reimbursement from the customer. Although we implement multiple fraud prevention and detection controls, \n\n\n34\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nwe cannot assure you that these controls will be adequate to protect against fraud. Substantial losses due to fraud or our inability to accept credit card payments could cause our customer base to significantly decrease and would harm our business.\n\n\nOur results of operations, which are reported in U.S. dollars, could be adversely affected if currency exchange rates fluctuate substantially in the future.\n\n\nWe sell subscriptions to access our products to customers globally and have offices globally. As we continue to expand our international operations, we will become more exposed to the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Although the majority of our cash generated from sales is denominated in U.S. dollars, a small amount is denominated in foreign currencies, and our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our operations. Because we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our results of operations in U.S. dollars, we also face remeasurement exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Any of these risks could hinder our ability to predict our future results and earnings. In addition, we do not currently maintain a program to hedge exposures to non-U.S. dollar currencies.\n\n\nTax authorities may successfully assert that we, including our acquired companies, should have collected, or in the future should collect, sales and use, value added or similar taxes, and we could be subject to substantial liabilities with respect to past or future sales, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\n\nWe currently collect and remit applicable sales taxes and other applicable transfer taxes in jurisdictions where we, through our employees or economic activity, have a presence and where we have determined, based on applicable legal precedents, that sales of subscriptions to access our products and platform are classified as taxable. We do not currently collect and remit state and local excise, utility user, or ad valorem taxes, fees, or surcharges in jurisdictions where we believe we do not have sufficient \u201cnexus.\u201d There is uncertainty as to what constitutes sufficient nexus for a state or local jurisdiction to levy taxes, fees, and surcharges on sales made over the internet, and there is also uncertainty as to whether our characterization of our products and platform as not taxable in certain jurisdictions will be accepted by state and local tax authorities.\n\n\nTax authorities may challenge our position that we do not have sufficient nexus in a taxing jurisdiction or that our products and platform are not taxable in such jurisdiction and may decide to audit our business and operations with respect to sales, use, value added, goods and services, and other taxes, which could result in significant tax liabilities (including related penalties and interest) for us or our customers, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation, and prospects.\n\n\nThe application of indirect taxes, such as sales and use, value added, goods and services, business, and gross receipts taxes, to businesses that transact online, such as ours, is a complex and evolving area. Following the U.S. Supreme Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., states and local jurisdictions in certain circumstances may levy sales and use taxes on sales of goods and services based on \u201ceconomic nexus,\u201d regardless of whether the seller has a physical presence in such jurisdiction. A number of states have already begun, or have positioned themselves to begin, requiring collection of sales and use taxes by online sellers. The details and effective dates of these collection requirements vary from state to state. As a result, it may be necessary for us to reevaluate whether our activities give rise to sales, use, and other indirect taxes as a result of any nexus in those states in which we are not currently registered to collect and remit taxes. Additionally, we may need to assess our potential tax collection and remittance obligations based on the requirements of existing or future economic nexus laws. There have been, and will continue to be, substantial ongoing costs associated with complying with the various indirect tax requirements in the numerous markets in which we conduct or may conduct business. If we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes from our customers, we could be held liable for such obligations. The application of existing, or future indirect tax laws, whether in the United States or internationally, or the failure to collect and remit such taxes, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\n\nOur corporate structure and intercompany arrangements cause us to be subject to the tax laws of various jurisdictions, and we could be obligated to pay additional taxes, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\n\n\nWe are expanding our international operations and personnel to support our business in international markets. We generally conduct our international operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries and are or may be required to report our taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. Our intercompany relationships are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations administered by tax authorities in various jurisdictions. The amount of taxes we pay in different jurisdictions may depend on the application of the tax laws of such jurisdictions, including the United States, to our international business activities, changes in tax rates, new or revised tax laws, or interpretations of existing tax laws and policies, and our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. The relevant tax authorities may disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses \n\n\n35\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nattributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a disagreement were to occur, and our position was not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest, and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows, and lower overall profitability of our operations.\n\n\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local income, sales, and other taxes in the United States and income, withholding, transaction, and other taxes in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Evaluating our tax positions and our worldwide provision for taxes is complicated and requires the exercise of significant judgment. During the ordinary course of business, there are many activities and transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We may be audited in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional taxes (including income taxes, sales taxes, and value added taxes) against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of any tax audits or litigation could differ materially from our historical tax provisions and accruals, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which a determination is made.\n\n\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by future changes to tax laws\n\n\nThe tax regimes we are subject to or operate under, including income and non-income taxes, are unsettled and may be subject to significant change. Changes in tax laws, regulations, or rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws and regulations, could materially adversely affect our company. For example, the 2017 Tax Cuts and JOBS Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d), together with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) that was enacted March 27, 2020, made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including changes to U.S. federal tax rates, additional limitations on the deductibility of interest, both positive and negative changes to the utilization of future net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards, and allowing for the expensing of certain capital expenditures. In addition, many countries in Europe, as well as a number of other countries and organizations (including the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the European Commission), have recently proposed, recommended, or (in the case of countries) enacted or otherwise become subject to changes to existing tax laws or new tax laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in the countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. Recently, in the United States, Congress and the current administration proposed legislation (which has not yet been enacted) to make various tax law changes, including to increase U.S. taxation of international business operations and impose a global minimum tax. These proposals, recommendations and enactments include changes to the existing framework in respect of income taxes that could apply to our business.\n\n\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $794.5 million of U.S. federal and $509.0 million of state NOL carryforwards available to reduce taxable income that we may have in the future. It is possible that we will not generate taxable income sufficient to use certain of these NOL carryforwards. Under legislative changes made by the TCJA, as modified by the CARES Act, U.S. federal net operating losses incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely, but the ability to utilize such federal net operating losses to offset taxable income in taxable years beginning after 2020 is limited to 80% of the current-year taxable income. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the TCJA. In addition, federal NOL carryforwards and certain tax credits may be subject to significant limitations under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d), respectively. Under those sections of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income or tax may be limited. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. We performed an analysis to determine whether net operating loss and credit carryover limitations existed under Section 382 as of December 31, 2021, and determined that a portion of the net operating losses and credit carryovers are subject to Section 382 annual limitations. We have determined that we should be able to fully utilize these net operating losses and credit carryovers before they expire, provided we generate sufficient taxable income. However, we may experience additional ownership changes in the future as a result of shifts in our stock ownership after December 31, 2021, some of which may be outside of our control. State NOL carryforwards and other state tax credits may be subject to similar limitations under state tax laws, and there may be periods during which the use of state net operating losses is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. For example, California recently imposed limits on the usability of California state net operating losses to offset California taxable income in tax years beginning after 2019 and before 2023. If an ownership change occurs and our ability to use our NOL carryforwards and tax credits is limited, or if our ability to utilize NOL carryforwards and certain tax credits is otherwise restricted by law, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\n\n\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\n\n\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\n\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile. The stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of \n\n\n36\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nparticular companies. In addition, the limited public float of our common stock may tend to increase the volatility of the trading price of our common stock. As a result of this volatility, you may not be able to sell your common stock at or above the price you paid for your shares. In addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this \nAnnual \nReport on Form 10-\nK\n, the market price for our common stock may be influenced by the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nactual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections, or our failure to meet these projections;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products or new or terminated significant contracts, commercial relationships, or capital commitments;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nindustry or financial analyst or investor reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe expiration of market stand-off or contractual lock-up agreements and sales of shares of our common stock by us or our stockholders;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nfailure of industry or financial analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, or our competitors\u2019 businesses, or the competitive landscape generally;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nlitigation involving us, our industry, or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property rights, our products, or third- party proprietary rights;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nany major changes in our management or our board of directors, particularly with respect to Mr. Courtemanche;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, health epidemics or pandemics, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or responses to these events.\n\n\nThese and other market and industry factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, regardless of our actual operating performance, which may limit or prevent investors from selling their shares at or above the price paid for the shares and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock.\n\n\nPrior to the IPO, there had not been a public market for our common stock. If an active trading market for our common stock does not continue to develop or is not sustained, you may not be able to sell your shares quickly or at the market price. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares of our common stock and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our common stock as consideration.\n\n\nSome companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their shares have been the subject of securities class action litigation. Any lawsuit to which we are a party, with or without merit, may result in an unfavorable judgment. We also may decide to settle lawsuits on unfavorable terms. Any such negative outcome could result in payments of substantial damages or fines, damage to our reputation or adverse changes to our business practices. Defending against litigation is costly and time-consuming, and could divert our management\u2019s attention and our resources. Furthermore, during the course of litigation, there could be negative public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, which could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. \n\n\n37\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nConcentration of ownership of our common stock among our existing executive officers, directors, and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions, including mergers, consolidations, or the sale of us or all or substantially \nall of\n our assets.\n\n\nOur executive officers, directors and stockholders who own more than 5% of our outstanding common stock beneficially own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock. If these persons acted together, they may be able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. The concentration of voting power and transfer restrictions could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company on terms that other stockholders may desire or result in the management of our company in ways with which other stockholders disagree.\n\n\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable or inaccurate research about our business, the market price and trading volume of our common stock could decline.\n\n\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be heavily influenced by the way analysts interpret our financial information and other disclosures. We do not have control over these analysts. If few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if industry analysts cease coverage of us, our stock price would be negatively affected. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, downgrade our common stock, or publish negative reports about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price to decline and could decrease the trading volume of our common stock.\n\n\nOur executive officers, directors and principal stockholders, if they choose to act together, have the ability to control or significantly influence all matters submitted to stockholders for approval. Furthermore, many of our current directors were appointed by our principal stockholders.\n\n\nAfter our IPO, our executive officers, directors, and greater than 5% stockholders, in the aggregate, beneficially owned a substantial majority of our outstanding common stock (assuming no exercise of options, warrants, or other rights outstanding as of the closing). Furthermore, many of our current directors were appointed by our principal stockholders. As a result, such persons or their appointees to our board of directors, acting together, will have the ability to control or significantly influence all matters submitted to our board of directors or stockholders for approval, including the appointment of our management, the election and removal of directors and approval of any significant transaction, as well as our management and business affairs. In addition, if any of our executive officers, directors, and greater than 5% stockholders purchase shares, or if any of our other current investors purchase shares and become greater than 5% stockholders as a result, the ability of such persons, acting together, to control or significantly influence such matters will increase. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquiror from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our business, even if such a transaction would benefit other stockholders.\n\n\nOur issuance of additional capital stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our equity incentive plans or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.\n\n\nWe expect to issue additional capital stock in the future that will result in dilution to all other stockholders. We expect to grant equity awards to employees, directors and consultants under our equity incentive plans. We may also raise capital through equity financings in the future. As part of our business strategy, we may acquire or make investments in companies, products or technologies and issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition or investment. Any such issuances of additional capital stock may cause stockholders to experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our common stock to decline.\n\n\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and, as a result, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\n\n\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock, and we do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, you may need to rely on sales of our common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on your investment.\n\n\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\n\n\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d \n\n\n38\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nincluding the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\n\n\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our IPO; (2) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenue is $1.07 billion or more; (3) the date on which we have, during the previous rolling three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities; and (4) the date we qualify as a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d with at least $700 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates.\n\n\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile.\n\n\nWe incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance with our public company responsibilities and corporate governance practices.\n\n\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, which we expect to further increase after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the NYSE, and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to compliance with these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. We cannot predict or estimate the totality of additional costs we incur as a public company or the specific timing of such costs.\n\n\nAs a result of being a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting, and any failure to maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\n\n\nWe will be required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year that coincides with the filing of our second Annual Report on Form 10-K. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC following the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We have commenced the costly and time-consuming process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404, but we may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion once initiated. Our compliance with Section 404 will require that we incur substantial expenses and expend significant management efforts. We may need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge and compile the system and process documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404.\n\n\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. In addition, changes in accounting principles or interpretations could also challenge our internal controls and require that we establish new business processes, systems and controls to accommodate such changes. Additionally, if these new systems, controls or standards and the associated process changes do not give rise to the benefits that we expect or do not operate as intended, it could adversely affect our financial reporting systems and processes, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial reports or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, our business may be harmed if we experience problems with any new systems and controls that result in delays in their implementation or increased costs to correct any post-implementation issues that may arise.\n\n\nDuring the evaluation and testing process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to certify that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, \n\n\n39\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nor to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\n\n\nCertain provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of our board of directors or current management, and may adversely affect our stock price.\n\n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. These provisions include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe denial of any right of our stockholders to remove members of our board of directors except for cause and, in addition to any other vote required by law, upon the approval of not less than two thirds of the total voting power of all our outstanding voting stock then entitled to vote in the election of directors;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairperson of our board of directors, chief executive officer, or by the board of directors acting pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of our board of directors, which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\ncertain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will require the approval of two-thirds of the then-outstanding voting power of our capital stock; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nadvance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\n\n\nThese provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time. See the section titled \u201cDescription of Capital Stock\u2014Anti-Takeover Effects of Delaware Law and Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.\u201d\n\n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and, to the extent enforceable, the federal district courts of the United States as the exclusive forums for certain disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\n\n\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty or other wrongdoing by any of our directors, officers, employees, or agents to us or our stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the amended and restated certificate of incorporation or the amended and restated bylaws, (4) any action to interpret, apply, enforce, or determine the validity of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws, or (5) any action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. This provision would not apply to lawsuits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. In addition, to prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated \n\n\n40\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\ncertificate of incorporation will further provide that the U.S. federal district courts will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. However, as Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all lawsuits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act, and an investor cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a provision. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions.\n\n\nThese exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. If a court were to find either exclusive forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, all of which could seriously harm our business.\n\n\n41\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "item7": ">Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \n\n\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should review the disclosure under Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of forward-looking statements and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. These statements, like all statements in this report, speak only as of their date (unless another date is indicated), and we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements in light of future developments. Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the \u201cCompany\u201d, \u201cProcore,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d and \u201cour\u201d refer to Procore Technologies, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. A discussion of the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 has been reported previously in our final prospectus dated May 19, 2021 filed with the SEC on May 21, 2021 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) (File No. 333-236789) of the Securities Act, under the heading \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d.\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nOur mission is to connect everyone in construction on a global platform.\n\n\nWe are a leading provider of cloud-based construction management software, and are helping transform one of the oldest, largest, and least digitized industries in the world. We focus exclusively on construction, connecting and empowering the industry\u2019s key stakeholders, such as owners, general contractors, specialty contractors, architects, and engineers, to collaborate from any location, on any internet-connected device. Our platform is modernizing and digitizing construction management by enabling real-time access to critical project information, simplifying complex workflows, and facilitating seamless communication among key stakeholders, all of which we believe positions us to serve as the system of record for the construction industry. Adoption of our platform helps customers increase productivity and efficiency, reduce rework and costly delays, improve safety and compliance, and enhance financial transparency and accountability.\n\n\nIn short, we build the software for the people that build the world.\n\n\nWe serve customers ranging from small businesses managing a couple million dollars of annual construction volume to global enterprises managing billions of dollars of annual construction volume. Our core customers are owners, general contractors, and specialty contractors operating across the commercial, residential, industrial, and infrastructure segments of the construction industry. We primarily sell subscriptions to access our products through our direct sales team, which is specialized by stakeholder, region, size, and type. \n\n\nOur products are offered on our cloud-based platform and are designed to be easy to configure and deploy. Our users can access our products on computers, smartphones, and tablets through any web browser or from our mobile application available for both the iOS and Android platforms. \n\n\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to access our products and have an unlimited user model that is designed to facilitate adoption and maximize usage of our platform by all project stakeholders. We sell our products on a subscription basis for a fixed fee with pricing generally based on the number and mix of products and the annual construction volume contracted to run on our platform. As our customers subscribe to additional products, or increase the annual construction volume contracted to run on our platform, we generate more revenue. We do not provide refunds for unused construction volume, or charge customers based on consumption or on a per project basis. Subscriptions to access our products include customer support and allow for unlimited users as we do not charge a per-seat or per-user fee. Customers can invite all project participants to engage with our platform as part of a project team. This includes the customer\u2019s employees and its collaborators, who are other project participants who engage with our platform but do not pay us for such use. Further, multiple stakeholders can be customers on the same project and retain access to project information for the duration of their subscription.\n\n\nRecent Developments\n\n\nOn May 24, 2021, we completed our IPO, in which we issued and sold\u00a010,410,000\u00a0shares of our common stock at a price of $67.00\u00a0per share, including 940,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise in full of the underwriters\u2019 option to purchase additional shares. We received net proceeds of $665.1\u00a0million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. In connection with the IPO, all outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock were automatically converted into an aggregate of\u00a085,331,278 shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis.\n\n\n45\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOn \nOctober 21, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of all outstanding equity of \nLaborChart\n, a labor management solution that facilitates labor scheduling, forecasting, office-to-field communications, certification tracking, data management, and labor analysis. \nThe purchase consideration to acquire \nLaborChart\n was $76.2 million, subject to customary adjustments for working capital, transaction expenses, cash, indebtedness, and the determination of any consideration for post-combination services\n.\n\n\nOn November 2, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of all outstanding equity of Levelset, a lien rights management company. Levelset also has a materials finance business that offers customers deferred payment terms on their purchases of construction materials. The materials finance business is currently immaterial, but may grow in the future. Pursuant to the merger agreement, the purchase consideration to acquire Levelset was $484.1 million, which consisted of $426.1 million in cash, subject to customary adjustments for working capital, transaction expenses, cash, indebtedness, and the determination of any consideration for post-combination services, and $58.0 million in shares of Procore common stock.\n\n\nCertain Factors Affecting Our Performance\n\n\nAcquiring New Customers and Retaining and Expanding Existing Customers\u2019 Use of Our Platform\n\n\nWe are highly focused on continuing to acquire new customers to support our long-term growth. We intend to efficiently drive new customer acquisitions by continuing to invest across our sales and marketing engine to engage our prospective customers, increase brand awareness, and drive adoption of our products and platform. The number of customers on our platform has increased from 8,506 as of December 31, 2019, to 10,166 as of December 31, 2020, to 12,193 as of December 31, 2021, reflecting a consistent year-over-year growth rate of 20% in both 2020 and 2021. All customer counts aforementioned exclude the customers acquired from Levelset, LaborChart, and Esticom, as they are on non-standard legacy contracts. Levelset, LaborChart, and Esticom customers will be included in our customer and ARR metrics when they are renewed onto standard Procore annual contracts. Levelset has more than 3,000 customers as of December 31, 2021.\n \nWe define ARR at the end of a particular period as the annualized dollar value of our subscriptions from customers as of such period end date. For multi-year subscriptions, ARR at the end of a particular period is measured by using the stated contractual subscription fees as of the period end date on which ARR is measured. For example, if ARR is measured during the first year of a multi-year contract, the first-year subscription fees are used to calculate ARR. ARR at the end of a particular period includes the annualized dollar value of subscriptions for which the term has not ended, and subscriptions for which we are negotiating a subscription renewal. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and does not represent our GAAP revenue on an annualized basis. ARR is not intended to be a replacement or forecast of revenue.\n\n\nOur ability to continue to grow our business and serve the broader needs of the construction industry depends on acquiring new customers, customers purchasing new products, renewing and expanding their use of existing products, and maintaining or increasing the price of our existing products.\n\n\nContinued Technology Innovation and Expansion of Our Platform\n\n\nWe plan to continue to invest in technology innovation and product development to enhance the capabilities of our platform. Additional features and products will also enable customers and collaborators to manage new workflows on our platform and allow us to attract a broader set of stakeholders. We have introduced new products developed in-house and through our acquisitions of Zimfly, Inc., Honest Buildings, Construction BI, LLC, Esticom, LaborChart, and Levelset. We intend to continue to invest in building additional products, financial offerings, features, and functionality that expand our capabilities and facilitate the extension of our platform. We also intend to continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions and investments in businesses and technologies to drive product and market expansion, such as our recent acquisitions of LaborChart and Levelset in October and November 2021, respectively. The acquisitions closed in the fourth fiscal quarter, and therefore the financial results post-acquisition of LaborChart and Levelset are included in the accompanying financial statements. In addition, we expect that expenses, both in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues, may increase from the current or historical periods. Our future success is dependent on our ability to successfully develop or acquire, market, and sell existing and new products to both new and existing customers. \n\n\nInternational Growth\n\n\nWe see international expansion as a major, and largely greenfield, opportunity for growth as we look to capture a larger part of the worldwide construction market. We have started to grow our presence internationally with the opening of sales and marketing offices in Sydney, Australia and Vancouver and Toronto, Canada in 2017, London, England in 2018 and Mexico City, Mexico in 2019. We have also developed focused sales and marketing efforts in Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, France, and Germany in 2021, where we do not yet maintain office locations. As a result of our international efforts, we support multiple languages and currencies. Non-U.S. revenue as a percentage of our total revenue was 14.6% in 2021, 12.2% in 2020, and 11.3% in 2019. We determine the percentage of non-U.S. revenue based on the billing location of each subscription.\n\n\n46\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFurthermore, we believe global demand for our products will continue to increase as we expand our international sales and marketing efforts, and the awareness of our products and platform grows. However, our ability to conduct our operations internationally will require considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the \nparticular challenges\n of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal, tax and regulatory systems, alternative dispute systems, and commercial markets. We have made, and plan to continue to make, significant investments in existing and select additional international markets. While these investments may adversely affect our operating results in the near term, we believe they will contribute to our long-term growth\n.\n\n\nCOVID-19 Update\n\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused general business disruption worldwide beginning in January 2020. Some local governments temporarily closed construction jobsites or imposed restrictions on construction activity, such as limiting the number of workers allowed on site. Construction teams had to learn to navigate pandemic safety protocols on jobsites and coordinate already complex construction processes with increasingly distributed workforces. Owners had to reconfigure existing buildings to improve safety and consider new distancing requirements in project designs, all amid increased materials and labor costs. We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has begun to change the way construction stakeholders operate by pushing them to adopt digital solutions that enable distanced, distributed workforces. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on the construction industry continue to evolve, and the impact on our financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain. \n\n\nFurthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has spurred changes in the way we work as we move to a more hybrid workforce. We are currently planning for a number of our employees to return to in-person offices in 2022; however, our plans may change if the number of COVID-19 cases rises where our offices are located or if there is an increase in new variants, and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, and business partners.\n\n\nThe full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, including any new variants, may directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. See the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for further discussion of the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results.\n\n\nComponents of Results of Operations\n\n\nRevenue\n\n\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to access our products and related support. Subscriptions are sold for a fixed fee and revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription. Our subscriptions generally have annual or multi-year terms, are typically subject to renewal at the end of the subscription term, and are non-cancelable. To the extent we invoice our customers in advance of revenue recognition, we record deferred revenue. Consequently, a portion of the revenue that we report each period is attributable to the recognition of revenue previously deferred related to subscriptions that we entered into during previous periods.\n\n\nCost of Revenue\n\n\nCost of revenue primarily consists of customer support personnel-related compensation expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, payroll taxes, and stock-based compensation expense, third-party hosting costs, software license fees, amortization of capitalized software development costs, amortization of acquired technology intangible assets, and allocated overhead. We expect our cost of revenue to increase on an absolute dollar basis as our revenue and acquisition activities increase. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in platform hosting, customer support, and software development as we grow our business and to ensure that our customers are realizing the full benefit of our products. The level and timing of investment in these areas could affect our cost of revenue in the future.\n\n\nCosts related to the development of internal-use software for new products and major platform enhancements are capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalized software development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the developed software\u2019s estimated useful life of two years and the amortization is recorded in cost of revenue.\n\n\nWe incurred significant additional cost of revenue expenses starting the second quarter of 2021 as a result of stock-based compensation expense associated with RSUs where the performance condition was satisfied upon the effective date of the registration statement for our IPO. In addition, subsequent to our IPO, we have incurred higher employer payroll taxes related to employee stock transactions. We anticipate additional stock-based compensation expense and employer payroll tax related \n\n\n47\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nto employee stock transactions going forward.\n In addition, we recorded and will continue to record significant amortization of acquired developed technology intangible assets \nas a result of\n the recent acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2021\n.\n\n\nOperating Expenses\n\n\nOur operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses. For each of these categories of expense, personnel-related compensation expenses are the most significant component, which include salaries, stock-based compensation, commissions, benefits, payroll taxes, and bonuses. To support the growth of our business, we also increased our headcount in each of these categories both organically and, to a lesser extent, through our acquisitions. \n\n\nWe incurred significant additional operating expenses starting the second quarter of 2021 as a result of stock-based compensation expense associated with RSUs where the performance condition was satisfied upon the effective date of the registration statement for our IPO. In addition, subsequent to our IPO, we have incurred higher employer payroll taxes related to employee stock transactions. We anticipate additional stock-based compensation expense and employer payroll tax related to employee stock transactions going forward.\n\n\nSales and Marketing\n\n\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation expenses for our sales and marketing organizations, advertising costs, marketing events, travel, trade shows and other marketing activities, contractor costs to supplement our staff levels, consulting services, amortization of acquired customer relationship intangible assets, and allocated overhead. We expense advertising and other promotional expenditures as incurred. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue, as we increase our investment in sales and marketing efforts over the foreseeable future, primarily from increased headcount in sales and marketing as well as investment in marketing to drive customer growth.\n\n\nResearch and Development\n\n\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation expenses for our engineering, product, and design teams, contractor costs to supplement our staff levels, consulting services, amortization of certain acquired intangible assets used in research and development activities, and allocated overhead. We expect research and development expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in headcount to build, enhance, maintain, and scale our products and platform.\n\n\nGeneral and Administrative\n\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation expenses for our finance, human resources, executive, information technology, legal, and other administrative functions. Additionally, general and administrative expenses include non-personnel-related expenses, such as professional fees for audit, legal, tax, and other external consulting services, including acquisition-related transaction expenses, costs associated with operating as a public company, including insurance costs, professional services, investor relations, and other compliance costs, property and use taxes, licenses, travel and entertainment costs, and allocated overhead. We expect to increase the size of our general and administrative functions to support the growth of our business, including our international expansion.\n\n\nInterest Expense, Net\n\n\nInterest expense, net consists primarily of interest expense associated with our finance leases and undrawn fees associated with our Credit Facility, which is partially offset by interest income from money market funds.\n\n\nChange in Fair Value of Series I Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock Warrant Liability\n\n\nChange in fair value of Series I redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability consisted of losses from the remeasurement of the Series I redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant to fair value from issuance in March 2020 to December 2020 when the warrants were exercised.\n\n\nOther (Expense) Income, Net\n\n\nOther (expense) income, net primarily consists of gain or loss on foreign currency transactions and miscellaneous other income.\n\n\n48\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(Benefit from)\n Provision for\n \nIncome Taxes\n\n\n(Benefit from) provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes of U.S. state franchise taxes and certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business, net of the release of valuation allowance as a result of deferred tax liabilities from acquisitions that are an available source of income to realize our deferred tax assets. As we expand our international operations, we expect to incur increased foreign tax expenses. We have a full valuation allowance for net U.S. and U.K. deferred tax assets. The U.S. valuation allowance includes NOL carryforwards, and tax credits related primarily to research and development for our operations in the United States. The U.K. valuation allowance is primarily comprised of NOL carryforwards. We expect to maintain this full valuation allowance for our net U.S. and U.K. deferred tax assets for the foreseeable future.\n\n\nResults of Operations\n\n\nThe following tables set forth our consolidated statements of operations data and such data as a percentage of revenue for each of the periods indicated.

2021, our revenue increased by $114.5 million, or 29%, compared to 2020, which is primarily due to expansion within our existing customers and revenue from new customers added during the year. The acquisition of Levelset in November 2021 contributed $4.2 million in revenue in 2021. Revenue from our other acquisitions in 2021 was not material. The increase in revenue from existing customers includes the net benefit of a full year of subscription revenue in 2021 from customers that were new in 2020 and continued their subscriptions in 2021, and customers that expanded their subscriptions in 2021 through the purchase of additional construction volume or products, as well as price increases.\n\n\nCost of Revenue, Gross Profit, and Gross Margin\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nChange\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nDollar\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPercent\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(dollars in thousands)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost of revenue\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n98,312\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n71,663\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n26,649\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n37\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGross profit\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n416,509\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n328,628\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n87,881\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGross margin\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n81\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n82\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe increase in cost of revenue in 2021 was primarily attributable to an increase of $14.1 million in personnel-related expenses, including an increase of $6.4 million in stock-based compensation expense and $5.5 million in salaries and wages driven by headcount and merit increases. Stock-based compensation expense increased primarily due to RSUs where the performance condition was satisfied upon the effectiveness date of the registration statement for the IPO. The increase in cost of revenue was also attributable to a $4.5 million increase in third-party cloud hosting and related services as we grow our customer base, a $4.2 million increase in amortization of acquired developed technology intangible assets related to recent acquisitions, and a $1.5 million increase in amortization of capitalized software.

Stock-based compensation expense increased primarily due to RSUs where the performance condition was satisfied upon the effectiveness date of the registration statement for the IPO.

Stock-based compensation expense increased primarily due to RSUs where the performance condition was satisfied upon the effectiveness date of the registration statement for the IPO. The increase in general and administrative expenses was also attributable to a $10.2 million increase in non-acquisition related professional fees primarily for contractors and consultants to supplement our staff levels, a $6.7 million increase in acquisition-related expenses primarily as a result of acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2021, a $3.1 million increase in insurance related costs associated with operating as a public company, and a $1.6 million increase in travel-related costs.

The warrants were exercised in December 2020, at which time remeasurement ceased. The loss recognized was primarily due to the increase in the fair value of the Series I redeemable convertible preferred stock from the issuance date through December 2020.\n\n\nThe change in other (expense) income, net during 2021 was primarily due to foreign currency losses related to changes in Australian and Canadian dollar exchange rates. \n\n\nThe change in benefit from income taxes during 2021 was primarily due to income tax benefits related to the release of a portion of our valuation allowance as a result of deferred tax liabilities recorded related to the acquisitions of Levelset and LaborChart that are available sources of income to realize our deferred tax assets\n.\n\n\n52\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\n\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d), we believe\u00a0certain non-GAAP\u00a0measures, as described below, are useful in evaluating our operating performance. We use this\u00a0non-GAAP\u00a0financial information, collectively, to evaluate our ongoing operations as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that\u00a0non-GAAP\u00a0financial information, when taken collectively, is helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance, and may assist in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar\u00a0non-GAAP\u00a0financial information to supplement their GAAP results. \n\n\nThe\u00a0non-GAAP\u00a0financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly-titled\u00a0non-GAAP\u00a0measures used by other companies. A reconciliation is provided\u00a0below\u00a0for each\u00a0non-GAAP\u00a0financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these\u00a0non-GAAP\u00a0financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\n\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit, Non-GAAP Gross Margin, Non-GAAP Operating Expenses, Non-GAAP Loss from Operations, and Non-GAAP Operating Margin\n\n\nWe define these non-GAAP financial measures as the respective GAAP measures, excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, employer payroll tax related to employee stock transactions, acquisition-related expenses, and restructuring-related charges. We excluded acquisition-related expenses for the first time during 2021 and have retrospectively adjusted comparable periods. Acquisition-related expenses include external and incremental transaction costs, such as legal and due diligence costs, and retention payments. These expenses are unpredictable, and generally would not have otherwise been incurred in the periods presented as part of our continuing operations. In addition, the size and complexity of an acquisition, which often drives the magnitude of acquisition-related expenses, may not be indicative of such future costs. We believe excluding acquisition-related expenses facilitates the comparison of our financial results to the Company\u2019s historical operating results and to other companies in our industry. Restructuring-related charges are the result of the Company streamlining our organization in 2020 to better align with our strategic goals and future scale. Refer to Note 17 in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding the 2020 restructuring event. \n\n\nThe following tables present

and Capital Resources\n\n\nHistorically, we financed our operations principally through private placements of our equity securities. In May 2021, we received $665.1 million in net proceeds from our IPO. \n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents of $589.2 million, which were held in checking accounts, savings accounts, and highly liquid money market funds. A portion of the cash and cash equivalents were used to complete the acquisitions of LaborChart and Levelset during the fourth quarter of 2021, and Indus.ai, Inc. (\u201cIndus\u201d) in the second quarter of 2021. The preliminary purchase consideration to acquire Levelset was $484.1 million, of which $426.1 million was paid in cash on the acquisition date of November 2, 2021. The preliminary purchase consideration to acquire LaborChart was $76.2 million, all of which was paid in cash on the acquisition date of October 21, 2021. The purchase consideration to acquire Indus was $24.3 million, of which $20.3 million was paid in cash on the acquisition date of May 3, 2021. \n\n\nWe also have our Credit Facility that may be used for general corporate purposes and is available until the Credit Facility\u2019s maturity on May 7, 2022. As of December 31, 2021, $75.0 million, less $6.5 million in outstanding letters of credit, was available to be drawn under the Credit Facility. \n\n\nLevelset also has a materials finance business that finances customers\u2019 purchases of construction materials and offers customers deferred payment terms. The materials finance business is currently immaterial, but is expected to grow in the future, which may impact our liquidity.\n\n\nIn the next 12 months, we have contractual commitments consisting of operating lease obligations of $12.9 million, finance lease obligations of $3.7 million, and non-cancelable purchase commitments of $19.8 million, as disclosed in Note 4 and Note 10 of the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next 12 months. While we have generated positive cash flows from operations in recent years, we have generated losses from operations in the past as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $662.2 million as of December 31, 2021. We may not achieve profitability in the foreseeable future due to the investments we intend to make and may require additional capital resources to execute strategic initiatives to grow our business. \n\n\nThis assessment is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties. Beyond the next 12 months, we have contractual commitments that we are reasonably likely to incur consisting of operating lease obligations of $46.8 million, finance lease obligations of $64.0 million, and non-cancelable purchase commitments of $21.8 million, as disclosed in Note 4 and Note 10 of the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our additional future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue growth rate, new customer acquisition and subscription renewal activity, timing of billing activities, our ability to integrate the companies or technologies we acquire and realize strategic and financial benefits from our investments and acquisitions, the timing and extent of spending to support further sales and marketing and research and development efforts, general and administrative expenses to support our growth, including international expansion, and the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing to fund these activities. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, or on acceptable terms, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\n\nFurther, as of December 31, 2021, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\n\n\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2019\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(in thousands)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n36,730\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n21,853\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n(7,004\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash used in investing activities\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(541,768\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(33,511\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(66,685\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n711,826\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n272,117\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n92,757\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n55\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOperating Activities\n\n\nOur largest source of cash from operating activities is collections from the sales of subscriptions to our customers.

(\u201cAvata\u201d), net of cash acquired, of $14.5 million, capitalized software development costs of $11.8 million, and purchases of property and equipment of $7.2 million primarily related to improvements to our leased office spaces and computer equipment purchases.\n\n\nFinancing Activities\n\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $711.8 million in 2021, which primarily consisted of $665.1 million in net proceeds from our IPO, $43.1 million in proceeds from stock option exercises, and $9.5 million in proceeds from ESPP partially offset by $3.9 million in payments of deferred offering costs and $1.5 million in payments on our finance lease obligations.\n\n\n56\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $272.1 million in 2020 primarily consisted of the proceeds of $189.8 million from the issuance of our Series I redeemable convertible preferred stock and preferred stock warrant, proceeds from the exercise of the Series I redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant of $55.0 million, and proceeds from stock option exercises of $31.2 million, partially offset by payments of offering costs of $2.3 million in connection with the anticipated sale of our common stock\n.\n\n\nCredit Facility\n\n\nOur Credit Facility provides for debt financing of up to $75.0 million to be used for general corporate purposes, including the financing of working capital requirements, and is secured by a blanket lien on the Company\u2019s assets. The Credit Facility has a maturity date of May 7, 2022, and carries a fee of 0.225% applied to unused balances and an interest rate equal to the \nWall Street Journal \nprime rate plus 1.25% applied to all amounts outstanding, with a floor of 3.25%. The Credit Facility contains financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum annual recurring revenue, as defined in the loan and security agreement, and a liquidity ratio, if the Credit Facility is drawn, of at least 1.25 to 1.00. The Credit Facility also contains restrictions on our ability to dispose of our business or property, engage in changes in business, merge with or acquire another business, incur indebtedness, encumber the collateral securing the Credit Facility, pay dividends, make distributions or payments to stockholders or redeem, retire, or repurchase any capital stock, or make any restricted investments. As of \nDecember 31\n, 2021, no amounts had been drawn down under the Credit Facility, and we were in compliance with all covenants.\n\n\nThe Credit Facility also provides us with the ability to issue standby letters of credit for up to $15.0 million, which if issued reduce the amount available for borrowing under the Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2021, we had issued letters of credit totaling $6.5 million to secure various U.S. and Australia leased office facilities. We may need to secure our leases with restricted cash in the future if the Credit Facility is not renewed at maturity.\n\n\nRemaining Performance Obligations\n\n\nOur subscriptions typically have a term of one to three years. The transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations under our subscriptions represents the contracted transaction price that has not yet been recognized as revenue, which includes deferred revenue and amounts under non-cancelable subscriptions that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. As of December 31, 2021, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $602.6 million, of which approximately 70% is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months and substantially all of the remainder between 12 and 36 months thereafter. We expect remaining performance obligations to change from period to period primarily due to the size, timing and duration of new customer contracts and customer renewals. Remaining performance obligations are also impacted by acquisitions\n\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\n\nCritical accounting policies and estimates are those accounting policies and estimates that are both the most important to the portrayal of our net assets and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates are developed based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Critical accounting estimates are accounting estimates where the nature of the estimates are material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and the impact of the estimates on financial condition or operating performance is material.\n\n\nThe critical accounting policies and estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our audited consolidated financial statements are described below.\n\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\n\nWe recognize revenue when a customer obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for these services. \n\n\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nIdentification of the contract, or contracts, with the customer;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nIdentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nDetermination of the transaction price;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nAllocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\n\n57\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nRecognition of the revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\n\n\nWe execute a signed contract with the customer that specifies the services to be provided, the payment amounts and terms, and the period of service, among other terms. The transaction price is determined by the stated fixed fees in the contract, excluding any sales related taxes.\n\n\nOur subscriptions often include promises to transfer multiple services. Determining whether services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or together may require judgment. Our subscriptions include access to our products and customer support over the subscription period. Access to the products and customer support represent a series of distinct services as we fulfill our obligation to the customer and the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the products and support over the subscription term. The series of distinct services represents a single performance obligation.\n\n\nWe recognize revenue ratably over the term of the subscription beginning on the date that service is made available to the customer.\n\n\nCosts to Obtain a Contract with a Customer\n\n\nWe recognize an asset for the incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be one year or longer. We have determined that sales commissions and bonuses paid for new contracts, including certain incremental sales to existing customers, meet the requirements to be capitalized as contract acquisition costs. The contract cost assets are deferred and then recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, which we estimate to be four years, which may exceed the term of the initial contract if commissions expected to be paid upon renewal are not commensurate with that of the original contract. Judgment is required to determine the expected period of benefit, which is based on estimates of customer lives and product technology life. \n\n\nBusiness Combinations\n\n\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Accounting for business combinations requires us to make estimates primarily relating to the valuation of intangible assets. Intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technology and acquired customer relationships. Valuations of acquired intangible assets require us to make judgments about the selection of valuation methodologies and also significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to, (1) the estimated level of effort and related costs of reproducing or replacing the assets acquired, (2) future expected cash flows from using the acquired customer relationships and technology, including future expected revenue, the rate of customer non-renewals of subscriptions, and operating expenses to deliver such expected revenue, (3) discount rates, (4) estimated royalty rate specifically used to value the acquired technology, and (5) selection of comparable companies. Fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability. Amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period, which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available.\n\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\n\nStock-based compensation expense related to stock awards is recognized based on the fair value of the awards granted. The fair value of RSUs and restricted stock awards (\u201cRSAs\u201d) is based on the estimated fair value of our common stock on the grant date. The fair value of each option award and ESPP purchase right is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The primary input in determining the fair value of the stock- based awards is the value of our common stock. Prior to becoming publicly traded, the valuation of our common stock required estimates which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management\u2019s judgment, as described below. The determination of the grant date fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is affected by the estimated fair value of our common stock as well as volatility, expected term, dividend yield, and risk-free rate. These assumptions represent management\u2019s best estimates and if different assumptions had been used, our stock-based compensation expense could have been materially different.\n\n\nFor awards that vest solely based on continued service, the grant date fair value is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally four years. For awards that contain both performance and service vesting conditions, the grant date fair value is recognized as compensation expense using a graded vesting attribution model. No expense is recognized for awards with performance conditions until that condition is probable of being met. We account for forfeitures as they occur instead of estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited.\n\n\n58\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPrior to our IPO, w\ne ha\nd\n granted RSUs to certain employees and non-employee consultants that contain\ned\n both liquidity- and service-based vesting conditions. \nUpon the effective date of the registration statement for our IPO in May 2021, the liquidity-based condition for all RSUs granted was satisfied and we recognized a cumulative catch-up stock-based compensation adjustment of $115.3 million in our consolidated statement of operations\n and comprehensive loss\n for the portion of the service period satisfied from the grant date through the effective date of the registration statement. \nAll RSUs granted \nsubsequent to\n the IPO vest based on continued service, which is generally over four years. \nAs of \nDecember \n31, 2021, \nthe total unrecognized stock-based compensation cost for all RSUs outstanding at that date was $281.0 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 2.0 years\n. \n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the total unrecognized stock-based compensation cost for unvested stock options was $12.2 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.1 years. \n\n\nWe issued RSAs to certain employees in connection with the acquisition of Honest Buildings in July 2019. The fair value of the RSAs was based on the fair value of the underlying stock issued. These shares were released from restriction 50% on the first anniversary and 50% on the second anniversary of the acquisition date based on the continued service of the key employees. As of December 31, 2021, all of the RSAs have vested. During 2021 and 2020, we recognized stock-based compensation expense of $1.6 million and $2.7 million, respectively, relating to these RSAs.\n\n\nWe issued 199,670 RSAs to certain Levelset employees in connection with the acquisition of Levelset in November 2021 that vest based on their continued service over a two-year period. The fair value of the RSAs issued was $95.05 per share which was the closing trading stock price of our common stock on the acquisition date. These shares are released from restriction quarterly over a two-year period assuming the continued service of the employees. As of December 31, 2021, no shares have vested. During 2021, we recognized stock-based compensation expense of $1.6 million relating to these shares.\n\n\nWe issued 166,370 shares of common stock in connection with the ESPP in November 2021. Employee payroll contributions used to purchase these shares were reclassified to stockholders\u2019 equity on the purchase date. Stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP is recognized on a straight-line basis over the offering period. During 2021, we recognized stock-based compensation expense of $8.5 million relating to the ESPP.\n\n\nCommon Stock Valuations\n\n\nSubsequent to the completion of our IPO in May 2021, the fair value of our common stock is determined based on the trading price of our common stock. Prior to the IPO, given our common stock was not publicly traded, our board of directors exercised significant judgment in determining the fair value of our common stock with input from management, based on several objective and subjective factors. Factors considered by our board of directors include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nour historical performance, financial condition, and prospects at the approximate time of grant of stock awards;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe value of companies that we considered peers based on several factors, including similarity to us with respect to industry, business model, profitability, stage of growth, and financial risk;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nrecent sales of our redeemable convertible preferred stock and private stock sale transactions;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe economic and competitive environment, including the industry in which we operate;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe rights, preferences, and privileges of our redeemable convertible preferred stock relative to those of our common stock;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an IPO or sale of all or a portion of the company;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthe lack of an active market for our common stock; and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\nthird-party valuations completed near the time of the grant.\n\n\nSince our inception, we have prepared valuations in a manner consistent with the method outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide, Valuation of Privately- Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.\n\n\nFor each valuation performed since 2016, we estimated the valuation of our common stock based on values implied by recent transactions in our stock in close proximity to the valuation date, if any, and based on a Probability Weighted Expected Return Method (\u201cPWERM\u201d) valuation model. The valuations for each of these methods closely reconciled to each other.\n\n\nIn estimating the valuation of our common stock using the PWERM, we calculated our equity value considering various exit scenarios including IPO and sale transactions, and staying private.\n\n\n59\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur equity value in an IPO scenario was determined using the Guideline Public Company Method. Under the Guideline Public Company Method we analyzed the equity value compared to trailing and forecast revenues multiples of our Guideline Public Companies in the software and technology industry and then applied those multiples to our 12 months trailing and projected revenue, as of the estimated liquidity, or exit, date.\n\n\nOur equity value in the sale transactions scenario was determined using the Recent Transaction Method. Under the Recent Transaction Method, we analyzed trailing and forecasted revenue multiples implied by recent acquisitions of companies similar to our business and then applied those multiples to our 12 months trailing and projected revenue, as of the estimated liquidity, or exit, date. Judgment is required on the selection of comparable companies, transactions, and the selection of the multiples. The selection of the multiples included judgments of our relative growth prospects, margin, and risks compared to the guideline companies. In addition, we are required to estimate our forecast revenues at the time of the exit event. We allocated the overall equity value implied by each of these scenarios to our common stock to estimate a per share value of our common stock.\n\n\nThe fair value of our common stock in a stay private scenario was determined using an income approach and market approach. Under the income approach, we forecast discrete cash flows over several years and a terminal value for a residual period beyond the discrete forecast period, which we discount at our estimated weighted-average cost of capital to estimate our enterprise value. Under the market approach, we estimated revenue multiples based on comparable guideline companies and applied these revenue multiples to our trailing 12 months and forecasted revenue. Judgment is required in estimating our future cash flows, discount rates, comparable companies, and multiples. We allocated the equity value implied by these valuation models in the private company scenario to our common stock using an option pricing model.\n\n\nEach of the above valuations was prepared on a minority, non-marketable interest basis.\n\n\nAfter determining a per share equity value for each scenario, we discounted the per share value for the estimated timing of the exit and then assigned a probability to each scenario to determine a probability weighted per share value of our common stock. Lastly, we applied a discount for lack of marketability as our stock is not publicly traded. Judgment is required on estimating the timing and exit event probabilities and discount for lack of marketability.\n\n\nJOBS Act Accounting Election\n\n\nThe JOBS Act, permits an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d such as us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards, and therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. We intend to rely on other exemptions provided by the JOBS Act, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\n\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of: (1) the last day of our first fiscal year in which we have total annual revenues of more than $1.07 billion; (2) the date we qualify as a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d with at least $700 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates; (3) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period; and (4) the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of our IPO.\n\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\n\nSee \u201cSummary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements.\n\n\n60\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "item7a": ">Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. \n\n\nForeign Currency and Exchange Risk\n\n\nThe vast majority of our cash generated from revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, with a small amount denominated in Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, Great British pounds, and Euros. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our operations, which are primarily in the United States, Australia, Canada, England, Mexico, and Egypt. Our results of current and future operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements during any of the periods presented. As the impact of foreign currency exchange rates has not been material to our historical operating results, we have not entered into derivative or hedging transactions, but we may do so in the future if our exposure to foreign currency becomes more significant.\n\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\n\nWe had cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $589.2 million as of December 31, 2021. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash consist of checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market funds. The cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital and general corporate purposes. The restricted cash is used as collateral to satisfy certain contractual arrangements related to corporate credit cards. Interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. Due to the short-term nature of our investments, we have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2021, a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio. We therefore do not expect our results of operations or cash flows to be materially affected by a sudden change in market interest rates.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInflation Risk\u00a0\n\n\nInflation can have a positive impact on our pricing since increased construction costs may increase construction volume purchased by customers, however supply chain challenges and labor shortages can result in delayed construction project starts, which may negatively impact construction volume purchased. Inflation can also result in higher personnel-related costs. We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Nonetheless, if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n\n\n\n\n61\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "companyName": "Procore Technologies, Inc.", "cusip": "74275K108"}
