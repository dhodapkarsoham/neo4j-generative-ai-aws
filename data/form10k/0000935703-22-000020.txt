{"item1": ">Item 1. Business\n\u201d for further discussion of the effect of competition on our operations.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we fail to attract and retain qualified associates and key personnel.\nOur growth and performance is dependent on the skills, experience and contributions of our associates, executives and key personnel for both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. Various factors, including the ongoing pandemic, constraints on overall labor availability, wage rates, regulatory or legislative impacts, and benefit costs could impact our ability to attract and retain qualified associates at our stores, distribution centers and corporate offices.\nWe are experiencing a shortage of associates and applicants to fill staffing requirements at our distribution centers, stores and corporate offices due to the current labor shortage affecting businesses. This has adversely affected the operating efficiency of our distribution centers and stores and our ability to transport merchandise from our distribution centers to our stores. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified associates for our distribution centers and stores in the future, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. \nRisks Relating to Strategic Initiatives \nWe may not be successful in implementing or in anticipating the impact of important strategic initiatives, and our plans for implementing such initiatives may be altered or delayed due to various factors, which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nWe have adopted important strategic initiatives that are designed to create growth, improve our results of operations and drive long-term shareholder value, including:\n\u2022\nthe conversion of our basic product price from $1.00 to $1.25 for the vast majority of merchandise in all Dollar Tree stores; \n\u2022\nthe expansion of a multi-price initiative in Dollar Tree stores referred to as Dollar Tree \nPlus\n;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of selected Dollar Tree merchandise into Family Dollar stores; \n\u2022\nthe roll-out of the Combo Store format that combines a Dollar Tree store and Family Dollar store in a single location;\n\u2022\nthe renovation of Family Dollar stores to the H2 format;\n\u2022\nour partnership with Instacart to provide home delivery of merchandise purchased online;\n\u2022\nour plans relating to new store openings for Dollar Tree and Family Dollar generally; and\n\u2022\nthe continued integration of the operations of Family Dollar with Dollar Tree.\n16\nTable of Contents\nThe implementation and timing of these strategic initiatives are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the acceptance of the amount of price increases by customers and others as justified or reasonable; customer acceptance of new store concepts and merchandise offerings; construction and permitting delays relating to new and renovated stores; the availability of desirable real estate locations for lease at reasonable rates; the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated issues; the success of our integration strategies; and other factors beyond our control. In addition, several of these initiatives depend on the timeliness, cost and availability of adequate levels of the appropriate domestic and imported merchandise, our ability to execute on our plans and expectations with respect to those initiatives and the continued success of our integration of Family Dollar merchandising, supply chain and operations with those of Dollar Tree. To the extent that shipping delays, supply chain disruptions and other distribution logistics adversely affect the availability of merchandise necessary to implement our strategic initiatives, we may delay or reduce our planned rate of implementation of one or more of those initiatives.\nThe rollout of our initiative to add price points above $1 in Dollar Tree stores is subject to additional risks and uncertainties relating to, among other things, provisions in our leases and/or third-party waivers tied to single or $1 price points, and compliance with the terms of our leases and state and local consumer laws, which may restrict price increases deemed unjustified in certain circumstances.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations or that they will generate expected returns, which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results. \nWe could incur losses due to impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets. \nUnder U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, we review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever economic events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Identifiable intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, including goodwill, are not amortized but are evaluated annually for impairment. A more frequent evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred.\nIn fiscal 2019, we recorded a $313.0 million non-cash pre-tax and after-tax goodwill impairment charge related to our Family Dollar reporting unit. The impairment was a result of business challenges including slower sales growth, higher freight, shrink and store labor costs. Should we experience similar business challenges or significant negative industry or general economic trends, we could recognize additional impairments to our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. We monitor key assumptions and other factors utilized in our goodwill impairment analysis, and if business or other market conditions develop that are materially different than we currently anticipate, we will conduct an additional impairment evaluation. Any reduction in or impairment of the value of goodwill or intangible assets will result in a charge against earnings, which could have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations and financial condition. For additional information on goodwill impairments please refer to \nNote 1\n to our consolidated financial statements under the caption \u201cGoodwill and Nonamortizing Intangible Assets.\u201d\nCybersecurity and Technology Risks\nWe rely on computer and technology systems in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of those systems including because of a cyber-attack could harm our ability to effectively operate and grow our business and could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe rely extensively on our computer and technology systems and, in certain cases, those of third-party service providers to manage inventory, process credit card and customer transactions and summarize results. Our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the distribution and sale of our merchandise depends significantly on the confidentiality, integrity and availability of these systems and on our ability to successfully integrate the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar systems. We also rely on third-party providers and platforms for some of these computer and technology systems and support.\nAlthough we have operational safeguards in place, they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available to us. This may be as the result of deliberate breach in the security of these systems or platforms by bad actors, including through malicious software, ransomware and other cyber-attacks, which may originate from state actors and may increase during times of international tensions. Failures may also be caused by various other factors, including power outages, catastrophic events, physical theft, computer and network failures, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors or improper use by our employees or third party service providers.\nIf these systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions and may receive negative publicity, which could adversely affect our results of operations and business. In addition, remediation of any problems with our systems could take an extensive amount of time and could result in significant, unplanned expenses.\n17\nTable of Contents\nThe potential unauthorized access to customer information may violate privacy laws and could damage our business reputation, subject us to negative publicity, litigation and costs, and adversely affect our results of operations or business.\nMany of our information technology systems, such as those we use for our point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, including online and mobile payment systems, and for administrative functions, including human resources, payroll, accounting, and internal and external communications, contain personal, financial or other confidential information that is entrusted to us by our customers and associates as well as proprietary and other confidential information related to our business and suppliers.\nWe have procedures and technology in place to safeguard our customers\u2019 personal information (including debit and credit card information), our associates\u2019 private data, suppliers\u2019 data, and our business records and intellectual property and other sensitive information. Despite these measures, we have experienced attempted and ongoing cyber-attacks, which are rapidly evolving. Perpetrators, who may include well-funded state actors, are becoming increasingly sophisticated and difficult to detect. We and/or our third party suppliers may be vulnerable to, and unable to anticipate, detect and appropriately respond to such cyber-security attacks, including data security breaches and data loss. \nWe are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which we operate regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal data. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, which became effective on January 1, 2020, and the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, which will become effective on January 1, 2023, impose responsibilities on us for the handling, disclosure and deletion of personal information for consumers who reside in California. These laws permit California to assess potentially significant fines for data privacy violations and create a right for individuals to bring class action suits seeking damages for violations. Our efforts to comply with California\u2019s consumer privacy laws and other similar privacy and data protection laws may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time, and we could incur substantial penalties or be subject to litigation related to violation of existing or future data privacy laws and regulations.\nLikewise, we are subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (\u201cPCI-DSS\u201d) which is mandated by the card brands and administered through the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council. As a Level 1 Merchant, we are subject to assessment and attestation for PCI-DSS compliance on an annual basis. A failure to meet and maintain compliance with PCI-DSS requirements could result in our inability to continue to accept credit cards as a form of payment, which would materially impact our ability to sell our products. In addition, our credibility and reputation within the business community and with our customers may be affected, which could result in our customers discontinuing the use of debit or credit cards in our stores or not shopping in our stores altogether. Non-compliance with PCI-DSS requirements also may subject us to recurring and accumulating fines until compliance is achieved. Considerable investments to strengthen our information security could also be required should we ever be deemed to be non-compliant. \nMoreover, significant capital investments and other expenditures could also be required to remedy cyber-security problems and prevent future security breaches, including costs associated with additional security technologies, personnel, experts and services (e.g., credit-monitoring services) for those whose data has been breached. These costs, which could be material, could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems.\nThe unavailability of our information technology systems or the failure of those systems or software to perform as anticipated for any reason and any inability to respond to, or recover from, such an event, could disrupt our business, decrease performance and increase overhead costs. If we are unable to secure our customers\u2019 credit card and confidential information, or other private data relating to our associates, suppliers or our business, we could be subject to negative publicity, costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and increased costs. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or business.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nLitigation, arbitration and government proceedings may adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation and arbitration involving employees, consumers, suppliers, competitors, shareholders, government agencies, or others through private actions, class actions, derivative actions, governmental investigations, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions, mass arbitration or other similar actions. \nIn addition, due to the types of products that we store and sell, our operations are subject to regulatory oversight by the FDA, the USDA, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration, and other federal, state, local and applicable foreign governmental authorities. If such authorities believe that we have failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures, they may require prompt corrective action, and/or proceed directly to other forms of enforcement action, including the imposition of operating restrictions, including a ceasing of operations in one or more facilities, enjoining and restraining certain violations of applicable law \n18\nTable of Contents\npertaining to products, seizure of products, and assessing civil or criminal sanctions or penalties. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations. From January 11, 2022 through February 11, 2022, DC 202 was inspected by the FDA and USDA. On February 11, 2022, the FDA issued Form 483 observations primarily regarding rodent infestation at DC 202, as well as other items that require remediation. In connection therewith, we initiated the Recall, temporarily closed DC 202 for extensive cleaning, temporarily closed the affected stores to permit the removal and destruction of inventory subject to the Recall, ceased sales of relevant inventory subject to the Recall, committed to the FDA to continue to cease the shipment of FDA-regulated products from DC 202 until FDA approval is received, and initiated corrective actions at DC 202 intended to ensure that these issues will not recur when shipment of FDA-regulated products recommences. If the FDA and/or other governmental authorities are not satisfied with these corrective actions or observe issues in our other distribution centers or stores, they may initiate other enforcement or administrative actions, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations. Also see \u201c\nWe may stop selling or recall certain products for safety-related issues\u201d \non page 13.\nWe have received the following class action complaints related to issues associated with DC 202 (and anticipate additional lawsuits of a similar nature):\nOn February 22, 2022, a proposed class action complaint was filed in the Circuit Court of Pope County, Arkansas, alleging various causes of action on behalf of the citizens of Arkansas who purchased \u201ccontaminated products\u201d covered by the Recall from January 1, 2021 through the date of such Recall. Plaintiffs seek restitution, disgorgement, damages, attorney fees, costs and expenses, punitive damages and such further relief (in each case in unspecified amounts), as the Court deems just and proper.\nOn February 23, 2022, a proposed class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, Northern Division, alleging various causes of action related to the sale of products that may be contaminated by virtue of a rodent infestation and other unsanitary conditions in stores throughout Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, Missouri and Tennessee. Plaintiffs seek damages, attorney fees and costs, punitive damages and the replacement of, or refund of money paid to purchase the relevant products, and any other legal relief available for their claims (in each case in unspecified amounts), including equitable and injunctive relief.\nOn February 25, 2022, a proposed class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, on behalf of all persons who purchased products subject to the Recall (with a subclass for all persons residing in the State of Tennessee who purchased products subject to the Recall), alleging breach of the implied warranty of merchantability and unjust enrichment. Plaintiffs seek restitution, damages, interest, punitive damages, attorney fees, costs and expenses, and such further relief (in each case in unspecified amounts), as the Court deems just and equitable.\nOn March 2, 2022, a proposed class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, alleging various causes of action related to the sale of products that may be contaminated by virtue of rodent infestation and other unsanitary conditions in stores throughout Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, Missouri and Tennessee. Plaintiffs seek damages, attorney fees and costs, punitive damages and the replacement of, or refund of money paid to purchase the relevant products, and any other legal relief available for their claims (in each case in unspecified amounts), including equitable and injunctive relief.\nOn March 4, 2022, a proposed class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, alleging various causes of action related to the sale of products that may be contaminated by virtue of rodent infestation and other unsanitary conditions in stores throughout Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, and Missouri. Plaintiffs seek damages, attorney fees and costs, punitive damages and the replacement of, or refund of money paid to purchase the relevant products, and any other legal relief available for their claims (in each case in unspecified amounts), including equitable and injunctive relief.\nOn March 7, 2022, a proposed class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama, alleging various causes of action related to the sale of products that may be contaminated by virtue of rodent infestation and other unsanitary conditions in stores throughout Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Missouri. Plaintiffs seek damages, attorney fees and costs, punitive damages and the replacement of, or refund of money paid to purchase the relevant products, and any other legal relief available for their claims (in each case in unspecified amounts), including equitable and injunctive relief.\nOn March 8, 2022, a proposed class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri, alleging various causes of action related to the sale of products that may be contaminated by virtue of rodent infestation and other unsanitary conditions in stores throughout Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee. Plaintiffs seek damages, attorney fees and costs, punitive damages and the replacement of, or refund of money paid to purchase the relevant products, and any other legal relief available for their claims (in each case in unspecified amounts), including equitable and injunctive relief.\nOn March 10, 2022, a proposed class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, Delta Division, alleging various causes of action related to the sale of products that may be contaminated by virtue of rodent infestation and other unsanitary conditions in stores throughout Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee and Missouri. Plaintiffs seek damages, attorney fees and costs, punitive damages and the replacement of, or refund of money paid to purchase the \n19\nTable of Contents\nrelevant products, and any other legal relief available for their claims (in each case in unspecified amounts), including equitable and injunctive relief.\nOn March 10, 2022, a proposed class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, Memphis Division, on behalf of all persons who purchased products subject to the Recall (with a subclass for all persons residing in the State of Tennessee who purchased products subject to the Recall), alleging breach of the implied warranty of merchantability, violation of the Tennessee Consumer Protection Act, and unjust enrichment. Plaintiffs seek refunds of unjust benefits, damages, interest, punitive damages, attorney fees, costs and expenses, and such further relief (in each case in unspecified amounts), as the Court deems just and equitable.\nWe intend to vigorously defend ourselves in the foregoing (and any similar) litigations. Although we have recently received the complaints, we do not believe that any of them will, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. However, we cannot assure that these litigations, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the period or year in which they are reserved or resolved. \nOn March 1, 2022, a federal grand jury subpoena was issued to us by the Eastern District of Arkansas requesting the production of information, documents and records pertaining to pests, sanitation and compliance with law regarding certain of our procedures and products. We intend to cooperate fully with the subpoena and any related investigation, however, no assurance can be given as to the timing or outcome of this matter. \nThree personal injury lawsuits are pending against us and our vendors alleging that certain talc products that were sold by the company in the past caused cancer. We intend to vigorously defend against these claims. Although we have been able to resolve previous talc lawsuits against us without material loss to the company, given the inherent uncertainties and high potential losses of talc litigation there can be no assurances regarding the outcome of pending or future cases. Future costs to litigate these cases are not known but may be significant, and it is uncertain whether our costs will be covered by insurance. In addition, although we have indemnification rights against our vendors in several of these cases, it is uncertain whether the vendors will have the financial ability to carry out their obligations. We do not believe that any of these lawsuits will, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. However, we cannot assure that these lawsuits, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the period or year in which they are reserved or resolved.\nOur products (or our storage and handling of such products) could also cause illness or injury, harm our reputation, and subject us to litigation. We are dependent on our vendors to ensure that the products we buy comply with all applicable safety standards. However, product liability, personal injury or other claims may be asserted against us relating to product contamination, product tampering, mislabeling, recall and other safety issues with respect to the products that we sell, or with respect to our handling or storage of such products, including as a result of the issues raised by the pending Arkansas FDA Matter (which has led to increased scrutiny of our operations by regulatory agencies, requiring further management attention and potential legal fees and other expenses). A significant product liability or other legal judgment against us, a related regulatory compliance or enforcement action or a product recall could materially and adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and/or results of operations. Moreover, even if a product liability, consumer fraud or other claim is unsuccessful, has no merit or is not pursued, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against the products we sell could materially and adversely affect our reputation. We seek but may not be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification from our vendors, where appropriate, or insurance coverage, and if we do not have adequate contractual indemnification or insurance available, such product liability or safety claims could adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations. Our ability to obtain the benefit of contractual indemnification from foreign vendors may be hindered by our ability to enforce contractual indemnification obligations against such vendors. Our litigation-related expenses could increase as well, which also could have a materially negative impact on our financial condition and/or results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued. \nThe outcome of such matters is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits or proceedings may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, certain of these matters, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may result in an expense that may be material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operations are required. The cost to defend current and future litigation or proceedings, including arbitrations, may be significant. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation, including litigation related to product or food safety, customer information and environmental or safety requirements, which could negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable.\nFor a discussion of current legal matters, please see \u201c\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\n\u201d and \nNote 4\n to our consolidated financial statements under the caption \u201cContingencies.\u201d Resolution of these matters, if decided against us, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, accrued liabilities or cash flows.\n20\nTable of Contents\nChanges in laws and government regulations, or our failure to adequately estimate the impact of such changes, could increase our expenses, expose us to legal risks or otherwise adversely affect us.\nOur business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations, and changes to those laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations in connection with climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy, including any federal or state laws enacted to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, could significantly increase our operating or merchandise costs or reduce the demand for our products. These laws and regulations may include, but are not limited to, requirements relating to hazardous waste materials, recycling, single-use plastics, extended producer responsibility, use of refrigerants, carbon pricing or carbon taxes, product energy efficiency standards and product labeling. If carbon pricing or carbon taxes are adopted, there is a significant risk that the cost of merchandise from our suppliers will increase and adversely affect our business and results of operations. \nIn addition, significant changes in laws or regulations that impact our relationship with our workforce, such as minimum wage increases, health care, labor laws or workplace safety, could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations. An increase in federal corporate tax rates also could adversely affect our profitability. Changes in other regulatory areas, such as consumer credit, privacy and information security, product and food safety, energy or environmental protection, and tariff and other trade restrictions, among others, could cause our expenses to increase or result in product recalls. Further, if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including wage and hour laws, we could be subject to legal risk, including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Indebtedness\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition, limit our ability to obtain additional financing, restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations and have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position. As of January 29, 2022, our total indebtedness is $3.45 billion. We may in the future incur substantial additional indebtedness. In addition, we have $1.5 billion of additional borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility, less amounts outstanding for letters of credit totaling $46.0 million. \nIn addition, our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, our cost of capital. Our ratings reflect the opinions of the ratings agencies of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations. There can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future.\nThe terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to pursue our business strategies, and could adversely affect our capital resources, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe agreements that govern our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests, including, among other things, restrictions on our ability to incur liens; make changes in lines of business, subject to certain exceptions; and consolidate or merge with or into, or sell all or substantially all of our assets to, another person.\nIn addition, certain of these agreements require us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants. Our ability to satisfy these financial maintenance covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet them.\nA breach of the covenants under these agreements could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness, which, if not cured or waived, could result in us having to repay our borrowings before their due dates. Such default may allow the debt holders to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or if we were to experience difficulty in refinancing the debt prior to maturity, our results of operations or financial condition could be materially affected. In addition, an event of default under our credit facilities may permit the lenders to terminate all commitments to extend further credit. In the event our lenders or holders of notes accelerate the repayment of such borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness.\nAs a result of these restrictions, we may be limited in how we conduct our business; unable to raise additional debt financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or unable to compete effectively, take advantage of new business opportunities or grow in accordance with our plans.\n21\nTable of Contents\nOur variable-rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nOur revolving credit facility is subject to variable rates that expose us to interest rate risk. We may also incur additional indebtedness subject to variable rates in the future. Interest rates, while historically low, may increase. When interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income decreases. Although we may enter into interest rate swaps involving the exchange of floating-for fixed-rate interest payments, to reduce interest rate volatility, we cannot assure you we will choose to or be able to do so.\nBorrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate derived from the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). SOFR is a relatively new reference rate and has a very limited history. The future performance of SOFR cannot be predicted based on its limited historical performance. Since the initial publication of SOFR in April 2018, changes in SOFR have, on occasion, been more volatile than changes in other benchmark or market rates, such as United States dollar LIBOR. Additionally, any successor rate to SOFR under our revolving credit facility may not have the same characteristics as SOFR or LIBOR. As a result, the amount of interest we may pay on our revolving credit facility is difficult to predict. \nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nOur business or the value of our common stock could be negatively affected as a result of actions by shareholders.\nWe value constructive input from investors and regularly engage in dialogue with our shareholders regarding strategy and performance. The Board of Directors and management team are committed to acting in the best interests of all of our shareholders. There is no assurance that the actions taken by the Board of Directors and management in seeking to maintain constructive engagement with our shareholders will be successful. Shareholders who disagree with our strategy or the way we are managed may seek to effect change in the future, through various strategies that could include private engagement, publicity campaigns, proxy contests, and litigation. Responding to these actions may be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, divert the attention of our Board of Directors, management and employees, and impact our relationship with investors, vendors, and other third parties. A change in the composition of our Board of Directors in response to shareholder engagement may result in changes to our business plans, operations, strategies, initiatives, governance, management and risk factors, which could be materially different from those described in this report. The perceived uncertainty as to our future direction resulting from these strategies could also affect the market price and volatility of our common stock.\nThe price of our common stock is subject to market and other conditions and may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors. These factors, some of which may be beyond our control, include the perceived prospects and actual results of operations of our business; changes in estimates of our results of operations by analysts, investors or us; trading activity by our large shareholders; trading activity by sophisticated algorithms (high-frequency trading); our actual results of operations relative to estimates or expectations; actions or announcements by us or our competitors; litigation and judicial decisions; legislative or regulatory actions or changes; and changes in general economic or market conditions. In addition, the stock market in general has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These market fluctuations could reduce the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our operating performance.\nCertain provisions in our Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws could delay or discourage a change of control transaction that may be in a shareholder\u2019s best interest.\nOur Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws contain provisions that may delay or discourage a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in his/her best interest. These provisions, among other things:\n\u2022\nprovide that only the Board of Directors, the chairman of the Board or the chief executive officer may call special meetings of the shareholders; \n\u2022\nestablish certain advance notice procedures for nominations of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder proposals to be considered at shareholders\u2019 meetings; and\n\u2022\npermit the Board of Directors, without further action of the shareholders, to issue and fix the terms of preferred stock, which may have rights senior to those of the common stock.\nHowever, we believe that these provisions allow our Board of Directors to negotiate a higher price in the event of a takeover attempt which would be in the best interest of our shareholders.", "item1a": ">Item 1A.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis section of Form 10-K generally discusses 2021 and 2020 events and results and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020.

As you read Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis, please refer to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, included in \u201c\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n\u201d of this Form 10-K. \nInitiatives and Recent Developments\nOur initiatives, as well as other recent developments that have had or are expected to have a significant effect on our operations are listed below:\n\u2022\nDollar Tree\n\u25e6\nIn September 2021, we announced our new $1.25 price point initiative and as of January 29, 2022, we increased the price point on a majority of our $1 merchandise to $1.25 in more than 5,800 legacy Dollar Tree stores. We completed the rollout of this initiative to all Dollar Tree stores during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. To date, the increase in the price point has more than offset the decline in the number of units sold. We expect to see a greater lift in gross margin in the first half of the year as we sell through our current inventory. We plan to invest in new products and modify existing products to provide greater value for our customers and increase customer traffic and store productivity. \n\u25e6\nAfter a successful launch of the Instacart platform in the Family Dollar segment, we began testing the online service delivery at Dollar Tree stores in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. As of January 29, 2022, the Instacart platform covers nearly 7,000 Dollar Tree stores. This enables our customers to shop online and receive same-day delivery without having to visit a store.\n\u25e6\nIn fiscal 2021, we continued to implement our Dollar Tree \nPlus\n initiative which introduces products priced at the $3 and $5 price points and provides our customers with extraordinary value in discretionary categories. As of January 29, 2022, we have approximately 660 Dollar Tree \nPlus\n stores. We plan to accelerate the implementation of the Dollar Tree \nPlus\n initiative in fiscal 2022 by adding the concept to an additional 1,500 stores.\n\u25e6\nThe roll-out of our Crafter\u2019s Square initiative to all of our Dollar Tree stores was completed during fiscal 2020. The Crafter\u2019s Square assortment carries mark-ups which are higher than our average mark-up.\n\u2022\nFamily Dollar \n\u25e6\nIn March 2019, we announced plans for a store optimization program for Family Dollar. For fiscal 2019, this program included rolling out a new model for both new and renovated Family Dollar stores, internally known as H2, re-bannering selected stores to the Dollar Tree brand, closing under-performing stores, and installing adult beverages and expanding freezers and coolers in selected stores. Our H2 stores have significantly improved merchandise offerings throughout the store, including the addition of approximately 20 Dollar Tree $1.00 merchandise sections (which transitioned to $1.25 in the first quarter of 2022) and establishing a minimum number of freezer and cooler doors. These stores have higher customer traffic and provide a higher average comparable store net sales lift, when compared to non-renovated stores, in the first year following renovation. H2 stores perform well in a variety of locations and especially in locations where our Family Dollar stores have been most challenged in the past. As of January 29, 2022, we have approximately 3,815 H2 stores and we plan to complete 800 H2 store renovations in fiscal 2022. In addition, we added adult beverage to 275 stores in fiscal 2021. We believe the addition of adult beverage to our assortment will drive traffic to our stores.\n\u25e6\nBuilding on the success of the H2 format, in March 2021, we announced the development of a new combination store format. Combo Stores leverage the strengths of the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar brands under one roof to serve small towns across the country. We are taking Family Dollar\u2019s great value and assortment and blending in select Dollar Tree merchandise categories, creating a new store format targeted for small towns and rural communities with populations of 3,000 to 4,000 residents. As of January 29, 2022, we had more than 240 Combo Stores in operation. Due to the success of this initiative, we plan to accelerate expansion of the program in fiscal 2022 by adding 400 new, renovated, or relocated Combo Stores. \n\u25e6\nAfter a successful pilot program in 2020, in February 2021, we entered into a partnership with Instacart, which covers more than 6,000 Family Dollar stores across the United States as of January 29, 2022.\n\u25e6\nIn fiscal 2019, the results of our annual goodwill impairment test showed that the fair value of the Family Dollar reporting unit was lower than its carrying value resulting in a $313.0 million non-cash pre-tax and after-tax goodwill impairment charge.\n27\nTable of Contents\n\u25e6\nIn fiscal 2019, we substantially completed the consolidation of the store support center in Matthews, North Carolina to our Summit Pointe development in Chesapeake, Virginia.\n\u25e6\nOn February 11, 2022, the FDA issued Form 483 observations primarily regarding rodent infestation at DC 202, as well as other items that require remediation. We initiated a voluntary retail-level product recall of FDA and USDA-regulated products stored and shipped to approximately 400 stores from DC 202 from January 1, 2021 through February 18, 2022, temporarily closed DC 202 for extensive cleaning, temporarily closed approximately 400 affected stores to permit the removal and destruction of inventory subject to the recall, ceased sales of relevant inventory subject to the recall, committed to the FDA to continue to cease the shipment of FDA-regulated products from DC 202 until FDA approval is received, and initiated corrective actions at DC 202 intended to ensure that these issues will not recur when shipment of FDA-regulated products recommences. The recall may have material adverse consequences. See \u201c\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\n\u201d and \nNote 4\n to our consolidated financial statements under the caption \u201cContingencies\u201d for information concerning the proposed class action complaints filed against Family Dollar related to these matters. We anticipate additional lawsuits of a similar nature related to the recall. See also \u201c\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n\u201d: \u201c\nLitigation, arbitration and government proceedings may adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations\n\u201d and \u201c\nWe may stop selling or recall certain products for safety-related issues\n.\u201d \n\u2022\nSupply Chain\n\u25e6\nIn the third quarter of 2019, we opened a new 1.2 million square foot distribution center in Morrow County, Ohio.\n\u25e6\nIn the third quarter of 2020, we opened a new 1.2 million square foot distribution center in Rosenberg, Texas and opened the first phase of our new Ocala, Florida distribution center.\n\u25e6\nThe following factors have impacted our operations in fiscal 2021 and we expect these challenges to continue in fiscal 2022:\n\u25aa\nShipping Delays:\n We rely heavily on Trans-Pacific shipping to acquire merchandise for our stores, and we are experiencing significant shipping delays as a result of the shipping capacity shortage which have negatively impacted our sales and the availability of product in the stores. We are also experiencing issues with port congestion and pandemic-related port closings and ship diversions. If the shipping delays do not improve they would continue to have a material adverse impact on product availability and product mix, and on our sales and merchandise margin. Sales could be negatively impacted if imported goods do not arrive in time to stock our stores, including the timely delivery of adequate levels of seasonal merchandise for the important Christmas holidays. If higher cost domestic goods are substituted for delayed imports, our merchandise margin could be adversely impacted. To address delays in shipments, we are prioritizing product categories for shipment in an effort to obtain seasonal assortments in advance of holiday seasons, adding and evaluating the use of long-term and short-term chartered vessels, and adding alternative sources of supply from North American factories.\n\u25aa\nFreight Costs:\n We are experiencing significantly higher international and domestic freight costs as a result of disruptions in the global supply chain. This trend is likely to continue. The combination of increased demand and limited availability of Trans-Pacific shipping capacity has caused spot market prices to increase substantially. We are a large importer of merchandise from Asia and particularly sensitive to freight costs. Import and domestic freight costs will present cost pressure in the first half of fiscal 2022 due to the annualization of fiscal 2021 rates. In addition, diesel fuel prices are expected to be significantly higher in fiscal 2022 and may increase further because of international tensions. We are working to reduce our freight costs by using chartered vessels, evaluating and securing long-term contracts with our carriers for vessels dedicated in large part to our needs, and adding alternative sources of supply that do not rely on Trans-Pacific shipping.\n\u25aa\nLabor Shortage:\n We are experiencing a shortage of associates and applicants to fill staffing requirements at our distribution centers due to the current labor shortage affecting businesses. This has adversely affected the operating efficiency of our distribution centers and our ability to transport merchandise from our distribution centers to our stores. The steps we have taken to address the labor shortage at our distribution centers include hosting national hiring events, paying sign-on bonuses, offering enhanced wages in select competitive markets, which is expected to increase our costs by more than $30.0 million in fiscal 2022, and paying tuition reimbursement.\n\u2022\nMinimum Wage Increases, Wage Investments and Store Labor Shortages\nIn 2022, the minimum wage has increased in certain States and localities. In addition, the federal minimum wage may increase depending on the outcome of legislation proposed in Congress. Minimum wage increases in States and localities and wage investments in certain markets are expected to increase our costs by more than $165.0 million in \n28\nTable of Contents\n2022. We are also experiencing a shortage of associates and applicants to fill staffing requirements at our stores due to the current labor shortage affecting businesses.\n\u2022\nBuild-out and Construction Costs and Delays\nWe have experienced higher commodity and other costs associated with the build-out of new stores and the renovation of existing stores. In addition, we have experienced delays in new store openings due to inspection, permitting and contractor delays. We anticipate these increased costs and delays may continue for the foreseeable future.\n\u2022\nImpact of COVID-19\nAs an essential business, our stores and distribution centers have remained open during the pandemic; however, our business trends and financial results in 2020 were materially different than in prior years. Our results of operations in fiscal 2020 include approximately $279.0 million of COVID-19-related expenses and these expenses totaled $33.5 million in fiscal 2021 and we expect them to be minimal in fiscal 2022.\nThe future impact of COVID-19 on our customers and our business is difficult to predict. The course of the pandemic, the effectiveness of health measures such as vaccines, and the impact of ongoing economic stabilization efforts is uncertain and government assistance payments may not provide enough funding to support future consumer spending at levels experienced during fiscal 2020 and 2021. For example, although the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (\u201cRescue Act\u201d), which was enacted on March 11, 2021, provided U.S. government funding to address the continuing impact of COVID-19 on the economy, public health, individuals and businesses, some of the enacted benefits, including $1,400 direct payments to individuals and supplemental unemployment benefits, were temporary and have been discontinued. Given the level of volatility and uncertainty surrounding the future impact of COVID-19 on our customers, suppliers and the broader economies in the locations that we operate as well as uncertainty around the future impact on our supply chain and the global supply chain, it is challenging to predict our future operations and financial results.\n\u2022\nLong-term Debt\n\u25e6\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, we prepaid $500.0 million of the $750.0 million Senior Floating Rate Notes due 2020 and accelerated the expensing of $0.3 million of deferred financing costs.\n\u25e6\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we repaid the remaining $250.0 million outstanding under the Senior Floating Rate Notes. \n\u25e6\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we preemptively drew $750.0 million on our revolving credit facility to reduce our exposure to potential short-term liquidity risk in the banking system as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, all of which was repaid by the end of the third quarter of 2020.\n\u25e6\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we repaid the $300.0 million 5.00% Senior Notes that we assumed upon the acquisition of Family Dollar.\n\u25e6\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, we refinanced our long-term debt obligations as follows:\n\u25aa\nWe completed the registered offering of $800.0 million of 2.65% Senior Notes due 2031 and $400.0 million of 3.375% Senior Notes due 2051 and used the proceeds of the offering to redeem the $1.0 billion 2023 Notes, which resulted in our incurring a $43.8 million prepayment penalty and we accelerated the expensing of $2.7 million of deferred financing and original issue discount costs associated with the 2023 Notes;\n\u25aa\nWe entered into a credit agreement for a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, which replaced our then-existing $1.25 billion revolving credit facility.\nFor additional information regarding the risks related to our business and operations, including risks relating to the implementation of our Dollar Tree and Family Dollar initiatives, see \u201c\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a leading operator of more than 16,000 retail discount stores and we conduct our operations in two reporting segments. Our Dollar Tree segment is the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise predominantly at the fixed price of $1.25. Our Family Dollar segment operates general merchandise retail discount stores providing consumers with a selection of competitively-priced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores.\nOur net sales are derived from the sale of merchandise. Two major factors tend to affect our net sales trends. First is our success at opening new stores. Second is the performance of stores once they are open. Sales vary at our existing stores from one year to the next. We refer to this as a change in comparable store net sales, because we include only those stores that are open throughout both of the periods being compared, beginning after the first fifteen months of operation. We include sales from stores expanded or remodeled \n29\nTable of Contents\nduring the year in the calculation of comparable store net sales, which has the effect of increasing our comparable store net sales. The term \u2018expanded\u2019 also includes stores that are relocated. Stores that have been re-bannered are considered to be new stores and are not included in the calculation of the comparable store net sales change until after the first fifteen months of operation under the new brand.\nAt January\u00a029, 2022, we operated stores in 48 states and the District of Columbia, as well as stores in five Canadian provinces. A breakdown of store counts and square footage by segment for the years ended January\u00a029, 2022 and January\u00a030, 2021 is as follows:\nYear Ended\nJanuary 29, 2022\nJanuary 30, 2021\nDollar Tree\nFamily Dollar\nTotal\nDollar Tree\nFamily Dollar\nTotal\nStore Count:\nBeginning\n7,805\u00a0\n7,880\u00a0\n15,685\u00a0\n7,505\u00a0\n7,783\u00a0\n15,288\u00a0\nNew stores\n311\u00a0\n225\u00a0\n536\u00a0\n341\u00a0\n156\u00a0\n497\u00a0\nRe-bannered stores\n1\u00a0\n(1)\n\u2014\u00a0\n(4)\n5\u00a0\n1\u00a0\nClosings\n(56)\n(88)\n(144)\n(37)\n(64)\n(101)\nEnding\n8,061\u00a0\n8,016\u00a0\n16,077\u00a0\n7,805\u00a0\n7,880\u00a0\n15,685\u00a0\nRelocations\n56\u00a0\n68\u00a0\n124\u00a0\n49\u00a0\n39\u00a0\n88\u00a0\nSelling Square Feet (in millions):\nBeginning\n67.4\u00a0\n57.7\u00a0\n125.1\u00a0\n64.6\u00a0\n56.7\u00a0\n121.3\u00a0\nNew stores\n2.7\u00a0\n2.0\u00a0\n4.7\u00a0\n3.1\u00a0\n1.3\u00a0\n4.4\u00a0\nRe-bannered stores\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n(0.1)\n0.1\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\nClosings\n(0.5)\n(0.6)\n(1.1)\n(0.3)\n(0.5)\n(0.8)\nRelocations\n0.1\u00a0\n0.1\u00a0\n0.2\u00a0\n0.1\u00a0\n0.1\u00a0\n0.2\u00a0\nEnding\n69.7\u00a0\n59.2\u00a0\n128.9\u00a0\n67.4\u00a0\n57.7\u00a0\n125.1\u00a0\nStores are included as re-banners when they close or open, respectively. Comparable store net sales for Dollar Tree may be negatively affected when a Family Dollar store is re-bannered near an existing Dollar Tree store. \nThe average size of stores opened in 2021 was approximately 8,760 selling square feet (or about 11,050 gross square feet) for the Dollar Tree segment and 8,880 selling square feet (or about 10,990 gross square feet) for the Family Dollar segment. For 2022, we continue to plan to open stores that are 8,000 - 10,000 selling square feet (or about 10,000 - 12,000 gross square feet) for both the Dollar Tree segment and the Family Dollar segment. We believe that these size stores are in the ranges of our optimal sizes operationally and give our customers a shopping environment which invites them to shop longer, buy more and make return visits.\nFiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 each included 52 weeks.\nThe percentage change in comparable store net sales on a constant currency basis for the fiscal year ended January\u00a029, 2022, as compared with the preceding year, is as follows:\nYear Ended January 29, 2022\nSales Growth\nChange in Customer Traffic\nChange in Average Ticket\nConsolidated\n1.0\u00a0\n%\n(3.3)\n%\n4.5\u00a0\n%\nDollar Tree Segment\n2.1\u00a0\n%\n(1.8)\n%\n3.9\u00a0\n%\nFamily Dollar Segment\n(0.1)\n%\n(5.6)\n%\n5.7\u00a0\n%\n Constant currency basis refers to the calculation excluding the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. We calculated the constant currency basis change by translating the current year\u2019s comparable store net sales in Canada using the prior year\u2019s currency exchange rates. We believe that the constant currency basis provides a more accurate measure of comparable store net sales performance. Comparable store net sales are positively affected by our expanded and relocated stores, which we include in the calculation, and are negatively affected when we open new stores, re-banner stores or expand stores near existing stores.\nResults of Operations\nOur results of operations and year-over-year changes are discussed in the following section. Note that gross profit margin is calculated as gross profit (i.e., net sales less cost of sales) divided by net sales. The selling, general and administrative expense rate and operating income margin are calculated by dividing the applicable amount by total revenue. \n30\nTable of Contents\nNet Sales\nYear Ended\nPercentage Change\nJanuary 29,\nJanuary 30,\nFebruary 1,\nFiscal 2021 vs. Fiscal 2020\n(dollars in millions)\n2022\n2021\n2020\nNet sales\n$\n26,309.8\u00a0\n$\n25,508.4\u00a0\n$\n23,610.8\u00a0\n3.1\u00a0\n%\nComparable store net sales change,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0on a constant currency basis\n1.0\u00a0\n%\n6.1\u00a0\n%\n1.8\u00a0\n%\nThe increase in net sales from 2020 to 2021 was a result of sales of $703.4 million at new stores and a comparable store net sales increase in the Dollar Tree segment, partially offset by a net decrease in sales in the current year from stores closed in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020. \nEnterprise comparable store net sales increased 1.0% on a constant currency basis in 2021, as a result of a 4.5% increase in average ticket and a 3.3% decrease in customer traffic. Comparable store net sales increased 1.1% when including the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations. On a constant currency basis, comparable store net sales increased 2.1% in the Dollar Tree segment and decreased 0.1% in the Family Dollar segment.\n In 2020, the Dollar Tree segment had a comparable store net sales increase of 2.2% and the Family Dollar segment had a comparable store net sales increase of 10.5%. The Family Dollar segment increase was due to higher demand for essential products in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and higher demand for discretionary items later in 2020.\nGross Profit\nYear Ended\nPercentage Change\nJanuary 29,\nJanuary 30,\nFebruary 1,\nFiscal 2021 vs. Fiscal 2020\n(dollars in millions)\n2022\n2021\n2020\nGross profit\n$\n7,725.9\u00a0\n$\n7,787.4\u00a0\n$\n7,040.7\u00a0\n(0.8)\n%\nGross profit margin\n29.4\u00a0\n%\n30.5\u00a0\n%\n29.8\u00a0\n%\n(1.1)\n%\nThe decrease in gross profit margin from 2020 to 2021 was a result of the net of the following:\n\u2022\nMerchandise cost, including freight, increased 140 basis points in 2021 compared to 2020 resulting primarily from higher freight costs in both segments, partially offset by increased initial mark-on in both segments and higher sales of lower cost discretionary merchandise in the Dollar Tree segment, primarily due to higher Easter seasonal sell-through.\n\u2022\nMarkdown costs increased 10 basis points resulting from a reserve for a product recall and higher clearance markdowns on the Family Dollar segment, partially offset by lower seasonal markdowns on the Dollar Tree segment and $10.4 million of uninsured markdown costs for stores affected by civil unrest in 2020.\n\u2022\nOccupancy costs increased 5 basis points primarily due to the loss of leverage from the comparable store net sales decrease on the Family Dollar segment.\n\u2022\nDistribution costs decreased 5 basis points resulting from COVID-19-related expenses in 2020 of $36.3 million, including COVID-19 premium pay for all hourly associates for all hours worked from March 8, 2020 through January 2, 2021, partially offset by hourly wage increases at the distribution centers in 2021 and higher depreciation costs on the Dollar Tree segment resulting from the two new distribution centers. COVID-19-related expenses at the distribution centers in 2021 were $8.8 million.\n\u2022\nShrink costs decreased 40 basis points resulting from favorable inventory results in relation to accruals and decreases in the accrual rates on both the Family Dollar and Dollar Tree segments in the current year. \n31\nTable of Contents\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nYear Ended\nPercentage Change\nJanuary 29,\nJanuary 30,\nFebruary 1,\nFiscal 2021 vs. Fiscal 2020\n(dollars in millions)\n2022\n2021\n2020\nSelling, general and administrative\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0expenses\n$\n5,925.9\u00a0\n$\n5,900.4\u00a0\n$\n5,778.5\u00a0\n0.4\u00a0\n%\nSelling, general and administrative\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0expense rate\n22.5\u00a0\n%\n23.1\u00a0\n%\n24.5\u00a0\n%\n(0.6)\n%\nThe decrease in the selling, general and administrative expense rate from 2020 to 2021 was the result of the net of the following:\n\u2022\nPayroll expenses decreased 70 basis points primarily due to lower COVID-19-related store payroll costs and lower incentive and stock compensation expenses, partially offset by minimum wage increases in the current year and higher health care costs. Fiscal 2021 and 2020 included $17.6 million and $212.6 million, respectively of COVID-19-related payroll costs. The COVID-19 expenses in 2021 were primarily for quarantine and sick pay as well as the related payroll taxes. The prior year expenses were for store payroll costs for a wage premium paid to all store hourly associates for all hours worked from March 8, 2020 through September 26, 2020, bonuses for certain field management associates, guaranteed bonus payouts and Thank You bonuses for store managers, quarantine pay and sick pay as well as the related payroll taxes. \n\u2022\nOther selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10 basis points primarily due to higher debit and credit fees as a result of increased debit and credit card penetration and higher advertising costs. \nWe recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $313.0 million in fiscal 2019, as discussed further in \nNote 1\n to our consolidated financial statements under the caption \u201cGoodwill and Nonamortizing Intangible Assets.\u201d Excluding the goodwill impairment charge in 2019, the selling, general and administrative expense rate was 23.2% in 2019. \nOperating Income\nYear Ended\nPercentage Change\nJanuary 29,\nJanuary 30,\nFebruary 1,\nFiscal 2021 vs. Fiscal 2020\n(dollars in millions)\n2022\n2021\n2020\nOperating income\n$\n1,811.4\u00a0\n$\n1,887.9\u00a0\n$\n1,262.2\u00a0\n(4.1)\n%\nOperating income margin\n6.9\u00a0\n%\n7.4\u00a0\n%\n5.3\u00a0\n%\n(0.5)\n%\nOperating income margin decreased to 6.9% in fiscal 2021 compared to 7.4% in fiscal 2020.

In the prior year, the restricted stock vesting resulted in an increase in tax expense. \nSegment Information\nWe operate a chain of more than 16,000 retail discount stores in 48 states and five Canadian provinces. Our operations are conducted in two reporting business segments: Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. We define our segments as those operations whose results our chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. \nWe measure the results of our segments using, among other measures, each segment\u2019s net sales, gross profit and operating income. The CODM reviews these metrics for each of our reporting segments. We may revise the measurement of each segment\u2019s operating income, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by the CODM. If the measurement of a segment changes, prior period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period\u2019s presentation. Corporate, support and Other consists primarily of store support center costs that are considered shared services and therefore these selling, general and administrative costs are excluded from our two reporting business segments. These costs include operating expenses for our store support center and the results of operations for our Summit Pointe property in Chesapeake, Virginia. The Family Dollar segment \u201cOperating income\u201d includes advertising revenue, which is a component of \u201cOther revenue\u201d in the accompanying consolidated income statements.

Average ticket increased 3.9% and customer traffic declined 1.8% in 2021.\nGross profit margin for the Dollar Tree segment decreased to 33.1% in 2021 from 34.3% in 2020. The decrease is due to the net of the following:\n\u2022\nMerchandise cost, including freight, increased 170 basis points due primarily to higher freight costs, partially offset by increased initial mark-on and higher sales of higher margin discretionary merchandise, including higher seasonal sell-through. \n\u2022\nMarkdown costs decreased 5 basis points resulting from lower seasonal markdowns in the current year due to improved seasonal sell-through, partially offset by increased dated product markdowns.\n\u2022\nDistribution costs decreased 5 basis points resulting primarily from lower COVID-19-related expenses in the current year, partially offset by higher depreciation costs related to two new distribution centers and higher hourly wages in the current year. Total distribution center COVID-19-related expenses were approximately $5.9 million and $21.3 million for fiscal \n33\nTable of Contents\n2021 and 2020, respectively. COVID-19-related expenses in 2020 included a wage premium paid to all distribution center hourly associates for all hours worked from March 8, 2020 through January 2, 2021.\n\u2022\nOccupancy costs decreased 5 basis points resulting from the leverage from the comparable store net sales increase in the current year.\n\u2022\nShrink costs decreased 40 basis points resulting from favorable inventory results in relation to accruals in the current year and a decrease in the shrink accrual rate.\nOperating income margin for the Dollar Tree segment decreased to 11.5% in 2021 compared to 12.0% in 2020. The decrease in operating income margin in 2021 was the result of lower gross profit margin as noted above, partially offset by a lower selling, general and administrative expense rate. The selling, general and administrative expense rate decreased to 21.5% in 2021 compared to 22.3% in 2020 primarily resulting from a decrease in payroll expenses of 65 basis points primarily due to lower COVID-19-related store payroll costs and lower incentive compensation expenses, partially offset by minimum wage increases and higher health insurance costs. Fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 included $9.5 million and $124.2 million, respectively, of COVID-19-related payroll expenses. COVID-19 expenses in the current year were primarily for quarantine and sick pay as well as the related payroll taxes. In the prior year, COVID-19-related payroll expenses included store payroll costs for a wage premium paid to all store hourly associates for all hours worked from March 8, 2020 to September 26, 2020, bonuses for certain field management associates, quarantine pay and sick pay as well as the related payroll taxes.\nOperating income in fiscal 2021 included $19.2 million of COVID-19-related expenses. Operating income in fiscal 2020 included $161.1 million of COVID-19-related expenses and $5.4 million of uninsured costs related to civil unrest.\nFamily Dollar\nThe following table summarizes the operating results of the Family Dollar segment:\nYear Ended\nPercentage Change\nJanuary 29,\nJanuary 30,\nFebruary 1,\nFiscal 2021 vs. Fiscal 2020\n(dollars in millions)\n2022\n2021\n2020\nNet sales\n$\n12,387.7\u00a0\n$\n12,243.4\u00a0\n$\n11,102.9\u00a0\n1.2\u00a0\n%\nGross profit\n3,122.3\u00a0\n3,243.6\u00a0\n2,697.8\u00a0\n(3.7)\n%\nGross profit margin\n25.2\u00a0\n%\n26.5\u00a0\n%\n24.3\u00a0\n%\n(1.3)\n%\nOperating income (loss)\n$\n543.1\u00a0\n$\n655.6\u00a0\n$\n(74.9)\n(17.2)\n%\nOperating income margin\n4.4\u00a0\n%\n5.4\u00a0\n%\n(0.7)\n%\n(1.0)\n%\nNet sales for the Family Dollar segment increased $144.3 million, or 1.2%, in 2021 compared to 2020 due to $257.2 million of new store sales, partially offset by a comparable store net sales decrease of 0.1%. Average ticket increased 5.7% and customer traffic declined 5.6% in 2021. \nGross profit margin for the Family Dollar segment decreased to 25.2% in 2021 compared to 26.5% in 2020. The decrease is due to the net of the following:\n\u2022\nMerchandise cost, including freight, increased 130 basis points primarily due to higher freight costs, partially offset by higher initial mark-on.\n\u2022\nMarkdown costs increased 20 basis points resulting from an increased reserve for a product recall and higher clearance markdowns, partially offset by $7.5 million of uninsured markdowns for stores affected by civil unrest in the prior year.\n\u2022\nOccupancy costs increased 15 basis points as a result of the loss of leverage from the comparable store net sales decrease and higher real estate tax expenses.\n\u2022\nShrink expense decreased 35 basis points resulting from favorable physical inventory results in relation to accruals and a decrease in the shrink accrual rate.\n\u2022\nDistribution costs decreased 5 basis points primarily due to lower COVID-19-related costs, partially offset by higher hourly wages. Total distribution center COVID-19-related expenses were $2.9 million and $15.0 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively. COVID-19-related expenses in the prior year included a wage premium for all distribution center hourly associates for all hours worked beginning March 8, 2020 through January 2, 2021.\n34\nTable of Contents\nOperating income margin decreased to 4.4% in 2021 compared to 5.4% in 2020, resulting from the gross margin decrease noted above, partially offset by a decrease in the selling, general and administrative expense rate. The selling, general and administrative expense rate was 20.9% in 2021 compared to 21.1% in 2020. The decrease was due to the net of the following: \n\u2022\nPayroll expenses decreased 50 basis points primarily due to lower COVID-19-related store payroll costs and lower incentive compensation expenses, partially offset by minimum wage increases and the loss of leverage from the comparable store net sales decrease. COVID-19-related payroll expenses for 2021 and 2020 were $8.1 million and $88.4 million, respectively. COVID-19 expenses in the current year were primarily for quarantine and sick pay as well as the related payroll taxes. The prior year included a wage premium paid to all store hourly associates for all hours worked from March 8, 2020 to September 26, 2020, bonuses for certain field management associates, guaranteed bonus payouts and Thank You bonuses for store managers, quarantine pay and sick pay as well as the related payroll taxes.\n\u2022\nStore facility costs decreased 5 basis points primarily due to lower telecommunication expenses and lower repairs and maintenance expenses. Fiscal 2020 included $2.8 million of incremental repairs and maintenance expenses for stores damaged by civil unrest.\n\u2022\nOther selling, general and administrative expenses increased 25 basis points primarily due to an increase in advertising expenses, increases in tax reserves and the loss of leverage from the comparable store net sales decrease. Promotional advertising was lower in the prior year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased 10 basis points primarily due to the loss of leverage from the comparable store net sales decrease and expenditures associated with the store renovation program.\nOperating income in fiscal 2021 included $13.9 million of COVID-19-related expenses. Fiscal 2020 included $115.5 million for COVID-19-related expenses and $12.8 million of uninsured costs related to civil unrest. Excluding the $313.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge in 2019, operating income margin for the Family Dollar segment was 2.1% in 2019. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur business requires capital to build and open new stores, expand and renovate existing stores, expand our distribution network and operate our existing stores. Our working capital requirements for existing stores are seasonal in nature and typically reach their peak in the months of September and October. Historically, we have satisfied our seasonal working capital requirements for existing stores and have funded our store opening and distribution network expansion programs from internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities.\nThe following table compares cash flow-related information for the years ended January\u00a029, 2022, January\u00a030, 2021 and February\u00a01, 2020:\n\u00a0\nYear Ended\n\u00a0\nJanuary 29,\nJanuary 30,\nFebruary 1,\n(in millions)\n2022\n2021\n2020\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n$\n1,431.5\u00a0\n$\n2,716.3\u00a0\n$\n1,869.8\u00a0\nInvesting activities\n(1,019.9)\n(889.7)\n(1,020.2)\nFinancing activities\n(836.5)\n(949.9)\n(709.8)\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $1,284.8 million in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily as a result of higher inventory levels and lower current liabilities, partially offset by higher accounts payable.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $130.2 million in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to higher capital expenditures in the current year.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased $113.4 million in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the following:\n\u2022\nOn December 1, 2021, we completed the registered offering of $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2031 and $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2051 and used the proceeds of the offering to \n35\nTable of Contents\nredeem the $1.0 billion 2023 Notes, which resulted in our incurring a $43.8 million prepayment penalty. In addition, in connection with the registering of these senior notes and the refinancing of our revolving line of credit, we paid $15.5 million in deferred financing costs.\n\u2022\nIn 2021, we paid $950.0 million in cash for stock repurchases compared to $400.0 million in the prior year.\n\u2022\nIn 2020, we also repaid the remaining $250.0 million of our $750.0 million Floating Rate Notes and the $300.0 million 5% Senior Notes. \nAt January\u00a029, 2022, our long-term borrowings were $3.45 billion and we had $1.5 billion available under our revolving credit facility, less amounts outstanding for standby letters of credit totaling $46.0 million. For additional detail on our long-term borrowings and other commitments, refer to the discussion of Funding Requirements below, as well as \nNote 4\n and \nNote 5\n to our consolidated financial statements.\nShare Repurchases\nWe repurchased 9,156,898, 3,982,478 and 1,967,355 shares of common stock on the open market in fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively, for $950.0 million, $400.0 million and $200.0 million, respectively. At January\u00a029, 2022, we had $2.5 billion remaining under Board repurchase authorization.\nFunding Requirements\nOverview\nWe expect our cash needs for opening new stores and expanding and renovating existing stores in fiscal 2022 to total approximately $748.0 million, which includes capital expenditures, initial inventory and pre-opening costs.\nOur estimated capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 are approximately $1.3 billion, including planned expenditures for our new and expanded stores, store renovations, distribution center expansions and the development of additional parcels on our Summit Pointe property, located in Chesapeake, Virginia, for mixed-use purposes. We believe that we can adequately fund our working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future from net cash provided by operations and potential borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nOur material contractual obligations consist of long-term debt and related interest payments and operating lease obligations. Additionally, we have commitments related to ocean shipping contracts, software license and support agreements, telecommunication services and store technology assets and maintenance for our stores. Other commitments include letters of credit for imported merchandise, standby letters of credit that serve as collateral for our large-deductible insurance programs and surety bonds that serve as collateral for utility payments at our stores and self-insured insurance programs. For additional information regarding these obligations, including amounts outstanding at January\u00a029, 2022, refer to \nNote 4\n, \nNote 5\n and \nNote 6\n to our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates. Certain of our estimates require a high level of judgment and have the potential to have a material effect on the financial statements if actual results vary significantly from those estimates. Following is a discussion of the estimates that we consider critical.\nInventory Valuation\nAs discussed in \nNote 1\n to our consolidated financial statements under the caption \u201cMerchandise Inventories,\u201d inventories at the distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost determined on a weighted-average basis. Cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weighted-average basis. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories. The retail inventory method is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis.\nInventory valuation methods require certain management estimates and judgments, including estimates of future merchandise markdowns and shrink, which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. The averaging required in applying the retail inventory method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns could, under certain circumstances, result in costs not being recorded in the proper period.\nWe estimate our markdown reserve based on the consideration of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, quantities of slow moving or seasonal carryover merchandise on hand, historical markdown statistics and future merchandising plans. The accuracy \n36\nTable of Contents\nof our estimates can be affected by many factors, some of which are outside of our control, including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends. Historically, we have not experienced significant differences in our estimated reserve for markdowns compared with actual results.\nOur accrual for shrink is based on the actual, historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted, if necessary, for current economic conditions and business trends. These estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger. Our physical inventory counts are generally taken between January and October of each year; therefore, the shrink accrual recorded at January\u00a029, 2022 is based on estimated shrink for most of 2021, including the fourth quarter. The amounts recorded in the current year reflect the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments\u2019 historical results. We periodically adjust our shrink estimates to reflect our best estimates based on the factors described and, historically, these adjustments have not been material.\nOur management believes that our application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market each year on a consistent basis.\nSelf-Insurance Liabilities\nThe liabilities related to our self-insurance programs for workers\u2019 compensation and general liability are estimates that require judgment and the use of assumptions. Semiannually, we obtain third-party actuarial valuations to aid in valuing the liabilities and in determining the amount to accrue during the year. These actuarial valuations are estimates based on our historical loss development factors and the related accruals are adjusted as management\u2019s estimates change.\nManagement\u2019s estimate for self-insurance liabilities could vary from the ultimate loss sustained given the difficulty in predicting future events; however, historically, the net total of these differences has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values. These assets are not amortized but are evaluated annually for impairment. A more frequent evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred. Such events or circumstances could include, but are not limited to, significant negative industry or economic trends, unanticipated changes in the competitive environment and a significant sustained decline in the market price of our stock.\nFor purposes of our goodwill impairment evaluation, the reporting units are Family Dollar, Dollar Tree and Dollar Tree Canada. Goodwill has been assigned to the reporting units based on prior business combinations related to the brands. In the event a qualitative assessment of the fair value of a reporting unit indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount, we then estimate the fair value using a combination of a market multiple method and a discounted cash flow method. Under the market multiple approach, we estimate a fair value based on comparable companies\u2019 market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) and adjusted for a control premium. Under the discounted cash flow approach, we project future cash flows which are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital analysis that reflects current market conditions, adjusted for specific reporting unit risks (primarily the uncertainty of achieving projected operating cash flows). If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nThe Family Dollar goodwill and trade name comprise a substantial portion of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and management\u2019s judgment utilized in the Family Dollar goodwill and trade name impairment evaluations is critical. The computations require management to make estimates and assumptions and actual results may differ significantly, particularly if there are significant adverse changes in the operating environment. Critical assumptions that are used as part of a quantitative Family Dollar goodwill evaluation include:\n\u2022\nThe potential future revenue, EBITDA and cash flows of the reporting unit. \nThe projections use management\u2019s assumptions about economic and market conditions over the projected period as well as our estimates of future performance and reporting unit revenue, gross margin, expenses and other factors. The resulting revenue, EBITDA and cash flow estimates are based on our most recent business operating plans, and various growth rates are assumed for years beyond the current business plan period. We did not perform a quantitative evaluation in fiscal 2021; however, we believe that the assumptions, estimates and rates used in our fiscal 2020 impairment evaluations are reasonable. Variations in the assumptions, estimates and rates could result in significantly different estimates of fair value.\n\u2022\nSelection of an appropriate discount rate. \nCalculating the present value of future cash flows requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate, which is based on a weighted-average cost of capital analysis. The discount rate is affected by changes in short-term interest rates and long-term yield as well as variances in the typical capital structure of marketplace participants. Given current economic conditions, it is possible that the discount rate will fluctuate in the near term. During \n37\nTable of Contents\nfiscal 2020, we engaged third party experts to assist in the determination of the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount the cash flows for our Family Dollar reporting unit. We did not perform a quantitative analysis in fiscal 2021; however, the weighted-average cost of capital used to discount the cash flows for our evaluation was 8.25% for our fiscal 2020 analysis.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, such as the Family Dollar trade name, are not subject to amortization but are reviewed at least annually for impairment. The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets to their carrying values. We estimate the fair value of our trade name intangible asset based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method. This approach is dependent upon a number of factors, including estimates of future growth and trends, royalty rates, discount rates and other variables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain. The discount rate includes a premium compared to the discount used for the Family Dollar goodwill impairment evaluation due to the inherently higher risk profile of intangible assets compared to the overall reporting unit.\nOur evaluation of goodwill did not result in impairment charges being recorded in fiscal 2021 or 2020. A non-cash impairment charge of $313.0 million was recorded in fiscal 2019 related to the Family Dollar reporting unit. Our evaluation of the Family Dollar trade name did not result in impairment charges during fiscal 2021, 2020 or 2019. Based on the results of the 2020 quantitative evaluation, the fair value of the Family Dollar reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a significant margin and the fair value of the Family Dollar trade name exceeded its carrying value by approximately 7.5%.\nFor additional information related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including the related impairment evaluations, refer to \nNote 1\n to our consolidated financial statements under the caption \u201cGoodwill and Nonamortizing Intangible Assets.\u201d For additional information related to uncertainties associated with the key assumptions and any potential events and/or circumstances that could have a negative effect on the key assumptions, please refer to \u201c", "item7a": ">Item 7A.\u00a0Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business, including the impact of interest rate changes and diesel fuel cost changes. We may enter into interest rate or diesel fuel swaps to manage exposure to interest rate and diesel fuel price changes. We do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging and we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposure to interest rate risk relates to our revolving credit facility, as borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at SOFR, reset periodically, plus 0.10%, plus 0.875% to 1.50% as determined by our credit ratings and leverage ratio. At January\u00a029, 2022, there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility. \n38\nTable of Contents\nItem 8.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three\u2011year period ended January 29, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2022, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated March 15, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nEstimated self\u2011insurance liability\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company considers actuarial assumptions to estimate its self\u2011insurance liability. As of January 29, 2022, the Company recorded an estimated liability of $317 million.\nWe identified the evaluation of the estimated self\u2011insurance liability as a critical audit matter. The estimation process involves auditor judgment and actuarial expertise to evaluate the actuarial methods and assumptions that are used to estimate future claim payments. Specifically, the evaluation includes the assumptions related to the loss development factors and expected loss rates which are primarily driven by historical claims paid and incurred data.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s self\u2011insurance liability estimation process. This included controls related to (1) the selection of the actuarial methods, and the development of the loss development factors and expected loss rates used to calculate the liability, and (2) the completeness and accuracy of historical claims paid and incurred data. We assessed the Company\u2019s estimate of the liability by testing a selection of certain data, including claims data, utilized by the Company\u2019s actuary by comparing it to relevant documentation. We involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n40\nTable of Contents\n\u2022\nassessing the Company\u2019s actuarial methods by comparing them to generally accepted actuarial methodologies; and\n\u2022\nevaluating the Company\u2019s actuarial estimates and assumptions related to the loss development factors and expected loss rates, by comparing them to generally accepted actuarial methodologies and the Company\u2019s historical data and trends.\n/s/ \nKPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 1987.\nNorfolk,

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1 - \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\nUnless otherwise stated, references to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cour\u201d in this annual report on Form 10-K refer to Dollar Tree, Inc. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. \nWe are a leading operator of discount retail stores in the United States and Canada. Below are those accounting policies that we consider to be significant.\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation \nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Dollar Tree, Inc., and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\nSegment Information\nAt January\u00a029, 2022, we operate more than \n16,000\n retail discount stores in \n48\n states and \nfive\n Canadian provinces. Our operations are conducted in \ntwo\n reporting business segments: Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. We define our segments as those operations whose results our chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources.\nThe Dollar Tree segment is the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise predominantly at the fixed price point of $\n1.25\n. The Dollar Tree segment includes our operations under the \u201cDollar Tree\u201d and \u201cDollar Tree Canada\u201d brands, \n15\n distribution centers in the United States and \ntwo\n distribution centers in Canada. \nThe Family Dollar segment operates a chain of general merchandise retail discount stores providing consumers with a selection of competitively-priced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores. The Family Dollar segment consists of our operations under the \u201cFamily Dollar\u201d brand and \n11\n distribution centers.\n \nRefer to \nNote 11\n for additional information regarding our operating segments. \nForeign Currency\nThe functional currencies of certain of our international subsidiaries are the local currencies of the countries in which the subsidiaries are located. Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the consolidated balance sheet date. Results of operations and cash flows are translated using the average exchange rates throughout the period. The effect of exchange rate fluctuations on translation of assets and liabilities is included as a component of shareholders\u2019 equity in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, which are included in \u201cOther expense, net\u201d have not been significant.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year is a 52-week or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. References to \u201c2021\u201d or \u201cfiscal 2021,\u201d \u201c2020\u201d or \u201cfiscal 2020,\u201d and \u201c2019\u201d or \u201cfiscal 2019\u201d relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended January\u00a029, 2022, January\u00a030, 2021, and February\u00a01, 2020, respectively.\n \nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents at January\u00a029, 2022 and January\u00a030, 2021 includes $\n680.6\n million and $\n1,135.0\n million, respectively, of investments primarily in money market securities which are valued at cost, which approximates fair value. We consider all highly-liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The majority of payments due from financial institutions for the settlement of debit card and credit card transactions process within three business days, and therefore are classified as cash and cash equivalents.\n47\nTable of Contents\nMerchandise Inventories\nMerchandise inventories at our distribution centers are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, determined on a weighted-average cost basis. Cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method on a weighted-average basis. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories.\nCosts directly associated with warehousing and distribution are capitalized as merchandise inventories.\n Total warehousing and distribution costs capitalized into inventory amounted to $\n203.2\n million and $\n172.7\n million at January\u00a029, 2022 and January\u00a030, 2021, respectively.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows:\nBuildings\n39\n to \n40\n years\nFurniture, fixtures and equipment\n3\n to \n15\n years\nLeasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets or the related lease terms. Amortization is included in \u201cSelling, general and administrative expenses\u201d in the accompanying consolidated income statements.\nCosts incurred related to software developed for internal use are capitalized and amortized, generally over \nthree years\n.\nCapitalized Interest \nWe capitalize interest on borrowed funds during the construction of certain property and equipment.\n We capitalized $\n1.1\n million, $\n3.2\n million and $\n2.4\n million of interest costs in the years ended January\u00a029, 2022, January\u00a030, 2021 and February\u00a01, 2020, respectively. \nInsurance Reserves and Restricted Cash\nWe utilize a combination of insurance and self-insurance programs, including a wholly-owned captive insurance entity, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including workers\u2019 compensation, general liability and automobile liability. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by us are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering claims experience, exposure and severity factors and other actuarial assumptions.\nDollar Tree Insurance, Inc., a South Carolina-based wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary of ours, charges the operating subsidiary companies premiums to insure the retained workers\u2019 compensation, general liability and automobile liability exposures. Pursuant to South Carolina insurance regulations, Dollar Tree Insurance, Inc. maintains certain levels of cash and cash equivalents related to its self-insured exposures.\nWe also maintain certain cash balances related to our insurance programs, which are held in trust and restricted as to withdrawal or use. These amounts are reflected in \u201cRestricted cash\u201d in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nLease Accounting\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2016-02,\u00a0\u201c\nLeases (Topic 842)\u201d \nand subsequent amendments, using the optional effective date transition method provided by accounting pronouncement, ASU No. 2018-11, \n\u201cLeases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements\u201d\n and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings. Adoption of the standard resulted in the recognition of Operating lease right-of-use assets and Operating lease liabilities of $\n6.2\n\u00a0billion and $\n6.1\n\u00a0billion, respectively, and a reduction to Retained earnings of $\n65.3\n\u00a0million, net of tax, as of February 3, 2019. For fiscal 2019, the adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated income statements or consolidated statements of cash flows.\nOur lease portfolio primarily consists of leases for our retail store locations and we also lease vehicles and trailers, as well as distribution center space and equipment. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception by evaluating whether the arrangement conveys the right to use an identified asset and whether we obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from and have the ability to direct the use of the asset. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. We recognize expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For leases with an initial term in excess of 12 months, operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future lease payments over the committed lease term at the lease commencement date. \n48\nTable of Contents\nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of future lease payments. Inputs to the calculation of our incremental borrowing rate include the valuations and yields of our outstanding senior notes and their credit spreads over comparable U.S. Treasury rates, adjusted to a collateralized basis by estimating the credit spread improvement that would result from an upgrade of one ratings classification. Most leases include one or more options to renew and the exercise of renewal options is at our sole discretion. We do not include renewal options in our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably certain. Operating lease expense for lease payments not yet paid is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The operating lease right-of-use asset is reduced by lease incentives, which has the effect of lowering the operating lease expense. Operating lease right-of-use assets are periodically reviewed for impairment losses. We use the long-lived assets impairment guidance in ASC Subtopic 360-10, \n\u201cProperty, Plant, and Equipment - Overall,\u201d\n to determine whether a right-of-use asset is impaired, and if so, the amount of the impairment loss to recognize.\nWe have real estate leases that typically include payments related to non-lease components, such as common area maintenance, as well as payments for real estate taxes and insurance which are not considered components of the lease. These payments are generally variable and based on actual costs incurred by the lessor. These costs are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs and excluded for the purpose of calculating the\u00a0right-of-use asset and lease liability. A smaller number of real estate leases contain fixed payments\u00a0for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use asset and lease liability. In addition, certain of our lease agreements include rental payments based on a percentage of retail sales over contractual levels and others include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. These payments are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive financial covenants.\nPurchased leases with terms which were either favorable or unfavorable as compared to prevailing market rates at the date of acquisition are amortized over the remaining lease terms, including, in some cases, an assumed renewal. Amortization expense, net of $\n38.5\n million, $\n48.1\n million and $\n52.9\n million was recognized in \u201cSelling, general and administrative expenses\u201d in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to these lease rights.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of\nWe review our long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets based on discounted cash flows or other readily available evidence of fair value, if any. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. In fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded charges of $\n4.4\n million, $\n4.6\n million and $\n9.1\n million, respectively, to write down certain assets, including $\n3.9\n\u00a0million, $\n3.8\n\u00a0million and $\n8.5\n million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, to write down Operating lease right-of-use assets. These charges are recorded as a component of \u201cSelling, general and administrative expenses\u201d in the accompanying consolidated income statements.\nGoodwill and Nonamortizing Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets, including the Family Dollar trade name, are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually. In addition, goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets will be tested on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred. \nWe perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the Family Dollar trade name is impaired. If we determine that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, we evaluate the Family Dollar trade name for impairment by comparing its fair value, based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method, to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nSubsequent to the evaluation of the Family Dollar trade name for impairment, we perform a goodwill impairment evaluation. In the event that a qualitative assessment of the fair value of a reporting unit indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount, we then estimate the fair value of the reporting unit using a combination of a market multiple method and a discounted cash flow method. We recognize goodwill impairment for the amount by which the reporting unit\u2019s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value, not to exceed the total carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nOur reporting units are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 350, \n\u201cIntangibles - Goodwill and Other.\u201d\n We perform our annual impairment testing of goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each year. \nThe annual goodwill impairment evaluations in 2021 and 2020 did not result in impairment. The 2019 goodwill impairment evaluation indicated that the fair value of the Family Dollar reporting unit was lower than its carrying value resulting in a $\n313.0\n million non-cash pre-tax and after-tax goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, which was recorded as a \n49\nTable of Contents\ncomponent of \u201cSelling, general and administrative expenses\u201d in the accompanying consolidated income statements. We have recorded cumulative goodwill impairment charges totaling $\n3,040.0\n\u00a0million, all of which relate to the Family Dollar reporting unit.\nOur annual impairment evaluation of the Family Dollar trade name did \nno\nt result in impairment charges during fiscal 2021, 2020 or 2019.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize sales revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time the customer tenders payment for and takes control of the merchandise.\nTaxes Collected\nWe report taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are directly imposed on revenue-producing transactions (i.e., sales tax) on a net (excluded from revenue) basis.\nCost of Sales\nWe include the cost of merchandise, warehousing and distribution costs, and certain occupancy costs in cost of sales.\nVendor Allowances\nWe receive vendor support in the form of cash payments or allowances through a variety of reimbursements such as purchase discounts, cooperative advertising, markdowns, scandowns and volume rebates. We have agreements with vendors setting forth the specific conditions for each allowance or payment. We either recognize the allowance as a reduction of current costs or defer the payment over the period the related merchandise is sold. If the payment is a reimbursement for costs incurred, it is offset against those related costs; otherwise, it is treated as a reduction to the cost of merchandise.\nPre-Opening Costs\nWe expense pre-opening costs for new, expanded, relocated and re-bannered stores and for distribution centers, as incurred.\nAdvertising Costs\nWe expense advertising costs as they are incurred and they are included in \u201cSelling, general and administrative expenses\u201d within the accompanying consolidated income statements.\n Advertising costs, net of co-op recoveries from vendors, were $\n93.9\n million, $\n80.8\n million and $\n102.9\n million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date of such change.\nWe recognize a financial statement benefit for a tax position if we determine that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination.\nWe include interest and penalties in the provision for income tax expense and income taxes payable. We do not provide for any penalties associated with tax contingencies unless they are considered probable of assessment.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize expense for all share-based payments to employees and non-employee directors based on their fair values. Total stock-based compensation expense for 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n79.9\n million, $\n83.9\n million and $\n61.4\n million, respectively.\nWe recognize expense related to the fair value of restricted stock units (RSUs) and stock options over the requisite service period on a straight-line basis or a shorter period based on the retirement eligibility of the grantee. The fair value of RSUs is determined using the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of stock option grants is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We account for forfeitures when they occur.\n \n50\nTable of Contents\nNet Income Per Share\nBasic net income per share has been computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted net income per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur assuming the inclusion of dilutive potential shares and has been computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares and dilutive potential shares outstanding. Dilutive potential shares include all outstanding stock options and unvested RSUs after applying the treasury stock method.\nNote 2 - \nSupplemental Balance Sheet Information\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\nProperty, plant and equipment, net, as of January\u00a029, 2022 and January\u00a030, 2021 consists of the following:\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJanuary 29,\nJanuary 30,\n(in millions)\n2022\n2021\nLand\n$\n239.7\n\u00a0\n$\n238.7\n\u00a0\nBuildings\n1,568.2\n\u00a0\n1,524.0\n\u00a0\nLeasehold improvements\n2,840.1\n\u00a0\n2,631.7\n\u00a0\nFurniture, fixtures and equipment\n4,704.1\n\u00a0\n4,229.4\n\u00a0\nConstruction in progress\n489.0\n\u00a0\n257.5\n\u00a0\nTotal property, plant and equipment\n9,841.1\n\u00a0\n8,881.3\n\u00a0\nLess: accumulated depreciation\n5,363.8\n\u00a0\n4,765.0\n\u00a0\nTotal property, plant and equipment, net\n$\n4,477.3\n\u00a0\n$\n4,116.3\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Depreciation expense was $\n672.0\n million, $\n631.1\n million, and $\n581.9\n million for the years ended January\u00a029, 2022, January\u00a030, 2021, and February\u00a01, 2020, respectively.\nOther Current Liabilities\nOther current liabilities as of January\u00a029, 2022 and January\u00a030, 2021 consist of the following:\n\u00a0\nJanuary 29,\nJanuary 30,\n(in millions)\n2022\n2021\nTaxes (other than income taxes)\n$\n313.5\n\u00a0\n$\n305.0\n\u00a0\nCompensation and benefits\n123.8\n\u00a0\n162.8\n\u00a0\nInsurance\n121.5\n\u00a0\n115.4\n\u00a0\nAccrued construction costs\n68.3\n\u00a0\n44.9\n\u00a0\nAccrued supplies\n27.4\n\u00a0\n25.2\n\u00a0\nOther\n147.5\n\u00a0\n162.0\n\u00a0\nTotal other current liabilities\n$\n802.0\n\u00a0\n$\n815.3\n\u00a0\n51\nTable of Contents\nNote 3 - \nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes consists of the following:\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYear Ended\n\u00a0\nJanuary 29,\nJanuary 30,\nFebruary 1,\n(in millions)\n2022\n2021\n2020\nCurrent taxes:\nFederal\n$\n271.1\n\u00a0\n$\n279.5\n\u00a0\n$\n210.1\n\u00a0\nState\n56.3\n\u00a0\n87.4\n\u00a0\n52.5\n\u00a0\nForeign\n0.1\n\u00a0\n0.2\n\u00a0\n0.1\n\u00a0\nTotal current taxes\n327.5\n\u00a0\n367.1\n\u00a0\n262.7\n\u00a0\nDeferred taxes:\nFederal\n50.3\n\u00a0\n32.6\n\u00a0\n39.2\n\u00a0\nState\n(\n76.5\n)\n(\n3.8\n)\n(\n5.6\n)\nForeign\n3.0\n\u00a0\n2.0\n\u00a0\n(\n24.6\n)\nTotal deferred taxes\n(\n23.2\n)\n30.8\n\u00a0\n9.0\n\u00a0\nProvision for income taxes\n$\n304.3\n\u00a0\n$\n397.9\n\u00a0\n$\n271.7\n\u00a0\nA reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate and the effective tax rate follows:\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYear Ended\nJanuary 29, 2022\nJanuary 30, 2021\nFebruary 1, 2020\nStatutory U.S. federal income tax rate\n21.0\n\u00a0\n%\n21.0\n\u00a0\n%\n21.0\n\u00a0\n%\nEffect of:\nState and local income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit\n3.7\n\u00a0\n3.2\n\u00a0\n3.7\n\u00a0\nNon-deductible executive compensation\n0.4\n\u00a0\n0.4\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\nState tax reserve release\n(\n0.4\n)\n(\n0.5\n)\n\u2014\n\u00a0\nIncremental tax expense (benefit) of exercises/vesting of equity-based\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0compensation\n(\n0.5\n)\n0.2\n\u00a0\n(\n0.4\n)\nWork Opportunity Tax Credit\n(\n1.8\n)\n(\n1.6\n)\n(\n2.7\n)\nDeferred tax rate change\n(\n3.8\n)\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n0.1\n\u00a0\nGoodwill impairment\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n6.0\n\u00a0\nChange in valuation allowance\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n(\n2.2\n)\nOther, net\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n0.2\n\u00a0\n(\n0.8\n)\nEffective tax rate\n18.6\n\u00a0\n%\n22.9\n\u00a0\n%\n24.7\n\u00a0\n%\nGoodwill Impairment\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $\n313.0\n million related to the Family Dollar goodwill, as further discussed in \nNote 1\n under the caption \u201cGoodwill and Nonamortizing Intangible Assets.\u201d As the purchase of Family Dollar was a stock acquisition, carryover basis applied for tax purposes. The impairment charge is not deductible for federal or state tax purposes and therefore there is no tax benefit related to the impairment.\nForeign Taxes\nUnited States income taxes have not been provided on accumulated but undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as we intend to permanently reinvest earnings. We do not consider the tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings and profits to be material. \n52\nTable of Contents\nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.\nSignificant components of our net deferred tax assets (liabilities) follow:\n(in millions)\nJanuary 29,\n2022\nJanuary 30,\n2021\nDeferred tax assets:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOperating lease liabilities\n$\n1,647.3\n\u00a0\n$\n1,658.4\n\u00a0\nNet operating losses, interest expense and credit carryforwards\n91.5\n\u00a0\n95.5\n\u00a0\nAccrued expenses\n50.7\n\u00a0\n72.9\n\u00a0\nAccrued compensation expense\n34.9\n\u00a0\n47.2\n\u00a0\nInventory\n24.4\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\nState tax election\n15.8\n\u00a0\n17.4\n\u00a0\nOther\n2.4\n\u00a0\n3.2\n\u00a0\nTotal deferred tax assets\n1,867.0\n\u00a0\n1,894.6\n\u00a0\nValuation allowance\n(\n13.0\n)\n(\n16.8\n)\nDeferred tax assets, net\n1,854.0\n\u00a0\n1,877.8\n\u00a0\nDeferred tax liabilities:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n(\n1,578.4\n)\n(\n1,587.2\n)\nOther intangibles\n(\n780.9\n)\n(\n840.4\n)\nProperty and equipment\n(\n435.6\n)\n(\n410.5\n)\nPrepaids\n(\n26.0\n)\n(\n25.2\n)\nInventory\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n(\n4.8\n)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n(\n2,820.9\n)\n(\n2,868.1\n)\nDeferred income taxes, net\n$\n(\n966.9\n)\n$\n(\n990.3\n)\nAt January\u00a029, 2022, we had certain state tax credit carryforwards, net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards totaling $\n91.5\n million. Some of these carryforwards will expire, if not utilized, beginning in 2022 through 2041.\nA valuation allowance of $\n13.0\n million, net of federal tax benefits, has been provided principally for certain state credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards. Since January\u00a030, 2021, the valuation allowance has been decreased to reflect state credits and net operating losses expected to be utilized over the carryforward period. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred taxes will not be realized. Based upon the availability of carrybacks of future deductible amounts and our projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, we believe it is more likely than not the remaining existing deductible temporary differences will reverse during periods in which carrybacks are available or in which we generate net taxable income. \nUncertain Tax Positions\nWe are participating in the IRS Compliance Assurance Program (\u201cCAP\u201d) for fiscal 2021 and we have been accepted into the program for fiscal 2022. This program accelerates the examination of key transactions with the goal of resolving any issues before the tax return is filed. Our federal tax returns have been examined and all issues have been settled through the fiscal 2019 tax year. Several states completed their examinations during fiscal 2021. In general, fiscal 2018 and forward are within the statute of limitations for state tax purposes. The statute of limitations is still open prior to fiscal 2018 for some states. In fiscal 2020, we participated in the CAP under the IRS\u2019s bridge year program and as a result, the IRS will not be completing an audit on the 2020 tax return. \nThe balance for unrecognized tax benefits at January\u00a029, 2022 was $\n20.9\n million. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at January\u00a029, 2022 that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $\n16.5\n million (net of the federal tax benefit).\n53\nTable of Contents\nThe following is a reconciliation of our total gross unrecognized tax benefits:\n(in millions)\nJanuary 29, 2022\nJanuary 30, 2021\nBeginning Balance\n$\n22.6\n\u00a0\n$\n28.9\n\u00a0\nAdditions for tax positions of prior years\n4.6\n\u00a0\n3.4\n\u00a0\nAdditions, based on tax positions related to current year\n2.7\n\u00a0\n1.2\n\u00a0\nLapses in statutes of limitation\n(\n9.0\n)\n(\n10.9\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n20.9\n\u00a0\n$\n22.6\n\u00a0\nWe believe it is reasonably possible that $\n8.5\n million to $\n9.5\n million of the reserve for uncertain tax positions may be reduced during the next 12 months principally as a result of the effective settlement of outstanding issues. It is also possible that state tax reserves will be reduced for audit settlements and statute expirations within the next 12 months. At this point it is not possible to estimate a range associated with the resolution of these audits. We do not expect any change to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.\nAs of January\u00a029, 2022, we have recorded a liability for potential interest and penalties of $\n2.1\n million.\nNote 4 \u2013 \nCommitments and Contingencies\nPurchase Obligations\nAt January\u00a029, 2022, we have commitments totaling $\n229.6\n\u00a0million related to ocean shipping contracts and commitments of $\n266.0\n million related to agreements for software licenses and support, telecommunication services and store technology assets and maintenance for our stores.\nLetters of Credit\nWe have $\n425.0\n million in Letter of Credit Reimbursement and Security Agreements with various financial institutions, under which $\n257.9\n million was committed to these letters of credit issued for routine purchases of imported merchandise at January\u00a029, 2022.\nAt January\u00a029, 2022, we also have $\n46.0\n million in standby letters of credit that serve as collateral for our large-deductible insurance programs and expire in fiscal 2022.\nSurety Bonds\nWe have issued various surety bonds that primarily serve as collateral for utility payments at our stores and self-insured insurance programs. These bonds total $\n118.6\n million and are committed through various dates through fiscal 2025.\nContingencies\nWe are defendants in legal proceedings including the class, collective, representative and large cases described below as well as individual claims in arbitration. We will vigorously defend ourselves in these matters. We do not believe that any of these matters will, individually or in the aggregate, have a material effect on our business or financial condition. We cannot give assurance, however, that one or more of these matters will not have a material effect on our results of operations for the quarter or year in which they are resolved.\nWe assess our legal proceedings monthly and reserves are established if a loss is probable and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. For matters that have settled, we reserve the estimated settlement amount even if the settlement has not been approved by the court. Many, if not substantially all, of our legal proceedings are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and the measurement of any loss can be complex and subject to judgment. With respect to legal proceedings where we have determined that a loss is reasonably possible but not probable, we are unable to estimate the amount or range of the reasonably possible loss due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of and uncertainties regarding legal proceedings. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions. Management\u2019s assessment of legal proceedings could change because of future determinations or the discovery of facts which are not presently known. Accordingly, the ultimate costs of resolving these proceedings may be substantially higher or lower than currently estimated.\n54\nTable of Contents\nDollar Tree Active Matters\nThe Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) has alleged that we improperly sold certain topically applied, over the counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) products manufactured by certain Chinese factories that were on an import \u201calert\u201d restriction issued by the FDA. We believe we have made significant improvements in our processes, and the FDA believes we have certain additional improvements to make, which we are addressing. \nActual or threatened California state court lawsuits have been filed against Dollar Tree and Family Dollar for similar employment-related claims brought under the Private Attorney General Act (\u201cPAGA\u201d). These cases may allege violations such as failure to provide employees with compliant rest and meal breaks, suitable seating and overtime pay, reimburse business expenses, pay minimum wages for all time worked, provide accurate wage statements, and timely pay wages as well as other off-the-clock and potential labor code violations.\nThree\n personal injury lawsuits are pending against us and our vendors alleging that certain talc products that were sold by the company in the past caused cancer. Although we have been able to resolve previous talc lawsuits against us without material loss to the company, given the inherent uncertainties of litigation there can be no assurances regarding the outcome of pending or future cases. Future costs to litigate these cases are not known but may be significant, and it is uncertain whether our costs will be covered by insurance. In addition, although we have indemnification rights against our vendors in several of these cases, it is uncertain whether the vendors will have the financial ability to carry out their obligations. \nDollar Tree Resolved Matters\nIn December 2020, a former store manager brought a class action in California state court alleging we failed to reimburse employees for business expenses and in so failing, engaged in unfair competition. The case has been resolved.\nFamily Dollar Active Matters\nOn February 11, 2022, the FDA issued Form 483 observations primarily regarding rodent infestation at our West Memphis, Arkansas distribution center (\u201cDC 202\u201d), as well as other items that require remediation. In connection therewith, we initiated a voluntary retail-level product recall of FDA and U.S. Department of Agriculture-regulated products stored and shipped from DC 202 from January 1, 2021 through February 18, 2022 (the \u201cRecall\u201d), temporarily closed DC 202 for extensive cleaning, temporarily closed the affected stores to permit the removal and destruction of inventory subject to the Recall, ceased sales of relevant inventory subject to the Recall, committed to the FDA to continue to cease the shipment of FDA-regulated products from DC 202 until FDA approval is received, and initiated corrective actions at DC 202 intended to ensure that these issues will not recur when shipment of FDA-regulated products recommences. We are taking this matter extremely seriously, and are responding to all observations made in the Form 483. We are cooperating fully with the FDA, and intend to cooperate fully with any other applicable regulatory body. We recorded total charges of approximately $\n34.1\n\u00a0million in the fourth quarter of our 2021 fiscal year in connection with the Recall, primarily attributable to inventory markdowns and related costs. The circumstances leading to the Recall (and/or the Recall itself) may have other negative impacts, which could include reputational damage, lost sales, further or additional governmental investigations and/or enforcement actions, and/or private litigation (see below), which could have a material adverse effect, individually or collectively, on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nWe have received the following class action complaints related to issues associated with DC 202 (and anticipate additional lawsuits of a similar nature):\nOn February 22, 2022, a proposed class action complaint was filed in the Circuit Court of Pope County, Arkansas, alleging various causes of action on behalf of the citizens of Arkansas who purchased \u201ccontaminated products\u201d covered by the Recall from January 1, 2021 through the date of such Recall.

We intend to cooperate fully with the subpoena and any related investigation, however, no assurance can be given as to the timing or outcome of this matter.\nIn August 2020 and July 2021, consumer class actions were filed against us in New York and Illinois, respectively, alleging Smoked Almonds sold by us are mislabeled because the almonds do not go through a smoking process but rather acquire their smoky taste through the use of smoked flavoring. The legal claims include consumer protection laws, negligent misrepresentations, breach of warranties, fraud and unjust enrichment.\nIn January, April, and September 2021, state-wide consumer class actions were filed against us by the same law firm in Georgia, Alabama and Florida, respectively, for breach of warranty based on the allegation that the coffee we sold was mislabeled because the canisters did not contain enough coffee to make the number of cups of coffee stated on the label. \nPlease see the description above for talc and PAGA lawsuits against Family Dollar.\nFamily Dollar Resolved Matters\nIn late 2019 and early 2020, personal injury and consumer class actions were filed alleging that we sold Zantac containing a probable carcinogen. After the lawsuits were dismissed in June 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal.\n56\nTable of Contents\nNote 5 - \nLong-Term Debt\nLong-term debt at January\u00a029, 2022 and January\u00a030, 2021 consists of the following:\nJanuary 29, 2022\nJanuary 30, 2021\n(in millions)\nPrincipal\nUnamortized Debt Discount and Issuance Costs\nPrincipal\nUnamortized Debt Discount and Issuance Costs\n$\n1.5\n billion Revolving Credit Facility, interest\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0payable at \n1.28\n% at January\u00a029, 2022\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n$\n6.4\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n$\n1.25\n billion Revolving Credit Facility\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n5.3\n\u00a0\n3.70\n% Senior Notes, due 2023\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n1,000.0\n\u00a0\n4.2\n\u00a0\n4.00\n% Senior Notes, due 2025\n1,000.0\n\u00a0\n4.0\n\u00a0\n1,000.0\n\u00a0\n5.1\n\u00a0\n4.20\n% Senior Notes, due 2028\n1,250.0\n\u00a0\n8.1\n\u00a0\n1,250.0\n\u00a0\n9.2\n\u00a0\n2.65\n% Senior Notes, due 2031\n800.0\n\u00a0\n9.5\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n3.375\n% Senior Notes, due 2051\n400.0\n\u00a0\n5.0\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\nTotal\n$\n3,450.0\n\u00a0\n$\n33.0\n\u00a0\n$\n3,250.0\n\u00a0\n$\n23.8\n\u00a0\nMaturities of long-term debt are as follows (in millions): \n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\n2026\nThereafter\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n$\n1,000.0\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n$\n2,450.0\n\u00a0\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn December 8, 2021, we entered into a credit agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent, and the financial institutions from time to time party thereto, providing for a $\n1.5\n\u00a0billion revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d), of which up to $\n350.0\n\u00a0million is available for letters of credit. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on December 8, 2026, subject to extensions permitted under the Credit Agreement.\nLoans under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus \n1.125\n%, subject to adjustment based on (i) our public debt rating and (ii) our leverage ratio. At January 29, 2022, the Revolving Credit Facility bore interest at \n1.28\n%. We pay certain commitment fees in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility allows voluntary repayment of outstanding loans at any time without premium or penalty, other than customary \u201cbreakage\u201d costs with respect to Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) loans. There is no required amortization under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility contains a number of affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, and subject to certain significant baskets and exceptions, restrict our ability to incur subsidiary indebtedness, incur liens, sell all or substantially all of our (including our subsidiaries\u2019) assets and consummate certain fundamental changes. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains a maximum leverage ratio covenant and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant. The Credit Agreement provides for certain events of default which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the loans under the Revolving Credit Facility to be declared due and payable and the commitments thereunder to be terminated.\nIn connection with entry into the Credit Agreement, we terminated all commitments and fulfilled all obligations under our existing credit agreement dated April 19, 2018. Under the previous credit agreement, in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we preemptively drew $\n750.0\n\u00a0million on our $\n1.25\n\u00a0billion revolving credit facility to reduce our exposure to potential short-term liquidity risk in the banking system as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, all of which was repaid by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2020. \nSenior Notes\nFiscal 2018 Offering\nOn April 19, 2018, we completed the registered offering of $\n750.0\n million aggregate principal amount of Senior Floating Rate Notes due 2020 (the \u201cFloating Rate Notes\u201d), $\n1.0\n billion aggregate principal amount of \n3.70\n% Senior Notes due 2023 (the \u201c2023 Notes\u201d), $\n1.0\n billion aggregate principal amount of \n4.00\n% Senior Notes due 2025 (the \u201c2025 Notes\u201d) and $\n1.25\n billion aggregate principal amount of \n4.20\n% Senior Notes due 2028 (the \u201c2028 Notes\u201d and together with the 2023 Notes and the 2025 Notes, the \u201cFixed Rate Notes\u201d; and the Fixed Rate Notes together with the Floating Rate Notes, the \u201cNotes\u201d). \n57\nTable of Contents\nThe Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of April 2, 2018 (the \u201cIndenture\u201d), between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of April 19, 2018 (the \u201cFirst Supplemental Indenture\u201d). \nThe Notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of ours and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future debt and other obligations that are not, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes.\nThe Floating Rate Notes matured on April 17, 2020 and bore interest at a floating rate, reset quarterly, equal to LIBOR plus \n70\n basis points. We were required to pay interest on the Floating Rate Notes quarterly, in arrears, on January 17, April 17, July 17 and October 17 of each year to holders of record on the preceding January 3, April 3, July 3 and October 3, respectively.

In addition, on or after the Applicable Par Call Date, we may redeem the Fixed Rate Notes of the applicable series, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, at a redemption price equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount thereof.\nIn the event of a Change of Control Triggering Event, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to any series, the holders of the Notes of such series may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes of such series at a purchase price equal to \n101\n% of the principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. The Indenture limits our ability and that of our subsidiaries, subject to significant baskets and exceptions, to incur certain secured debt. The First Supplemental Indenture also provides for events of default which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal of and accrued interest on the Notes to become or to be declared due and payable, as applicable.\nFiscal 2021 Offering\nOn December 1, 2021, we completed the registered offering of $\n800.0\n\u00a0million aggregate principal amount of \n2.65\n% Senior Notes due 2031 (the \u201c2031 Notes\u201d) and $\n400.0\n\u00a0million aggregate principal amount of \n3.375\n% Senior Notes due 2051 (the \u201c2051 Notes\u201d and, together with the 2031 Notes, the \u201cNew Notes\u201d).\nThe New Notes were issued pursuant to the Indenture, as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of December 1, 2021 (the \u201cSecond Supplemental Indenture\u201d).\nThe New Notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of ours and rank equally in right of payment to all of our existing and future debt and other obligations that are not, by their terms, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the New Notes.\nThe 2031 Notes mature on December 1, 2031 and bear interest at the rate of \n2.650\n% per annum. The 2051 Notes mature on December 1, 2051 and bear interest at the rate of \n3.375\n% per annum. We are required to pay interest on the New Notes semi-annually, in arrears, on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2022, to holders of record on the preceding May 15 and November 15, respectively.\nWe may redeem the New Notes of each series in whole or in part at any time and from time to time prior to (i) in the case of the 2031 Notes, September 1, 2031, and (ii) in the case of the 2051 Notes, June 1, 2051 (the date with respect to each such series, the \u201cApplicable Par Call Date\u201d), in each case, at a \u201cmake-whole\u201d price described in the Second Supplemental Indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. In addition, on or after the Applicable Par Call Date, we may redeem the New Notes of the applicable series, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, at a redemption price equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount thereof. \nIn the event of a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the Second Supplemental Indenture) with respect to any series, the holders of the New Notes of such series may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of their New Notes of such series at a purchase price equal to \n101\n% of the principal amount of such New Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. The Indenture limits our ability and that of our subsidiaries, subject to significant baskets and exceptions, to incur certain secured debt. The Indenture also provides for events of default which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal of and accrued interest on the New Notes to become or to be declared due and payable, as applicable.\n58\nTable of Contents\nRepayments of Long-term Debt\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, we prepaid $\n500.0\n million of our $\n750.0\n million Floating Rate Notes and we repaid the remaining $\n250.0\n\u00a0million outstanding in the first quarter of 2020.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we repaid the $\n300.0\n\u00a0million \n5.00\n% Senior Notes that we assumed upon the acquisition of Family Dollar in 2015.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we used the proceeds from the offering of the New Notes discussed above to redeem the $\n1.0\n\u00a0billion 2023 Notes.

The Missouri Bonds are debt issued by the lessor in the Missouri Lease. Therefore, we hold the debt instrument pertaining to our Missouri Lease obligation. Because a legal right of offset exists, we are accounting for the Missouri Bonds as a reduction of our Missouri Lease obligation in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nNote 7 - \nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, a fair value hierarchy has been established that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nAs required, financial assets and liabilities are classified in the fair value hierarchy in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nCertain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (e.g., when there is evidence of impairment). We review certain store assets for evidence of impairment. The fair values are determined based on the income approach, in which we utilize internal cash flow projections over the life of the underlying lease agreements discounted based on our risk-adjusted rate. These measures of fair value, and related inputs, are considered a Level 3 approach under the fair value hierarchy. Refer to \nNote 1\n under the caption \u201cImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of\u201d for information regarding the impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets are recorded at carrying value, and, if impaired, are adjusted to fair value using Level 3 inputs. Refer to \nNote 1\n under the caption \u201cGoodwill and Nonamortizing Intangible Assets\u201d for further information regarding the process of determining the fair value of these assets.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying amounts of Cash and cash equivalents, Restricted cash and Accounts payable as reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities.\n60\nTable of Contents\nThe aggregate fair values and carrying values of our long-term borrowings were as follows:\nJanuary 29, 2022\nJanuary 30, 2021\n(in millions)\nFair Value\nCarrying Value\nFair Value\nCarrying Value\nLevel 1\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSenior Notes\n$\n3,558.5\n\u00a0\n$\n3,423.4\n\u00a0\n$\n3,654.4\n\u00a0\n$\n3,231.5\n\u00a0\nThe fair values of our Senior Notes were determined using Level 1 inputs as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are available.

The plan permitted us to grant equity awards in the form of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d), performance bonuses, performance share units (\u201cPSUs\u201d), non-employee director stock options and other equity-related awards. As of March 17, 2021, the plan was no longer available for new grants of awards, but all outstanding awards that were granted under the plan prior to March 17, 2021 continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of the plan and applicable award agreements. Effective June 10, 2021, the 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan was replaced and superseded by the 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (\u201cOmnibus Plan\u201d). The Omnibus Plan permits us to grant up to \n6.5\n\u00a0million shares of our Common Stock to our employees, consultants and directors. The form of equity awards authorized for grant under the Omnibus Plan are substantially the same as those permitted by the predecessor plan. \nStock appreciation rights may be awarded alone or in tandem with stock options. When the stock appreciation rights are exercisable, the holder may surrender all or a portion of the unexercised stock appreciation right and receive in exchange an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value at the date of exercise over the fair market value at the date of the grant. No stock appreciation rights have been granted to date.\nAny restricted stock, RSUs or PSUs awarded are subject to certain general restrictions. The restricted stock shares or units may not be sold, transferred, pledged or disposed of until the restrictions on the shares or units have lapsed or have been removed under the provisions of the plan. In addition, if a holder of restricted shares or units ceases to be employed by us, any shares or units in which the restrictions have not lapsed will be forfeited.\nThe 2013 Director Deferred Compensation Plan permits any of our directors who receive a retainer or other fees for Board or Board committee service to defer all or a portion of such fees until a future date, at which time they may be paid in cash or shares of our common stock, or receive all or a portion of such fees in non-statutory stock options. Deferred fees that are paid out in cash will earn interest at the 30-year Treasury Bond Rate. If a director elects to be paid in common stock, the number of shares will be determined by dividing the deferred fee amount by the closing market price of a share of our common stock on the date of deferral. The number of options issued to a director will equal the deferred fee amount divided by \n33\n% of the price of a share of our common stock. The exercise price will equal the fair market value of our common stock at the date the option is issued. The options are fully vested when issued and have a term of \n10\n years.\nIn conjunction with the acquisition of Family Dollar in 2015, we assumed the Family Dollar Stores, Inc. 2006 Incentive Plan (the \u201c2006 Plan\u201d). The 2006 Plan permitted the granting of a variety of compensatory award types, including stock options and performance share rights.\n62\nTable of Contents\nTotal stock-based compensation expense was recorded in the accompanying consolidated income statements as follows:\n\u00a0\nYear Ended\n\u00a0\nJanuary 29,\nJanuary 30,\nFebruary 1,\n(in millions)\n2022\n2021\n2020\nCost of sales\n$\n18.3\n\u00a0\n$\n15.4\n\u00a0\n$\n12.9\n\u00a0\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n61.6\n\u00a0\n68.5\n\u00a0\n48.5\n\u00a0\nTotal stock-based compensation expense\n$\n79.9\n\u00a0\n$\n83.9\n\u00a0\n$\n61.4\n\u00a0\nExcess tax benefit (deficit) on stock-based compensation\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0recognized in the Provision for income taxes\n$\n8.5\n\u00a0\n$\n(\n2.8\n)\n$\n3.8\n\u00a0\nRestricted Stock\nWe issue service-based RSUs to employees and officers and issue PSUs to certain of our officers.

Our operations are conducted in \ntwo\n reporting business segments: Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. We define our segments as those operations whose results our CODM regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. \nWe measure the results of our segments using, among other measures, each segment\u2019s net sales, gross profit and operating income. The CODM reviews these metrics for each of our reporting segments. We may revise the measurement of each segment\u2019s operating income, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by the CODM. If the measurement of a segment changes, prior period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period\u2019s presentation. Corporate, support and Other consists primarily of store support center costs that are considered shared services and therefore these selling, general and administrative costs are excluded from our \ntwo\n reporting business segments.

Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required to apply our judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nOur management has carried out, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of January\u00a029, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were designed and functioning effectively to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our management conducted an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\n. Based on this assessment, our management has concluded that, as of January\u00a029, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting is effective. \nOur independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has audited our consolidated financial statements and has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Their report appears below.\nChanges in Internal Controls\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n67\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors\nDollar Tree, Inc.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Dollar Tree, Inc. and subsidiaries\u2019 (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2022, based on criteria established in\n Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2022, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021, the related consolidated income statements, and statements of comprehensive income, shareholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three\u2011year period ended January 29, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated March 15, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nNorfolk, Virginia\nMarch\u00a015, 2022 \n68\nTable of Contents\nItem 9B.
