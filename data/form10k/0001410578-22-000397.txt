{"item1": ">ITEM 1.        BUSINESS\nGeneral Overview\nBank First Corporation is a Wisconsin corporation that was organized in April 1982 to serve as the holding company for Bank First, N.A., a national banking association founded in 1894. The Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company and the Bank are headquartered in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, and the Bank is a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the \u201cFederal Reserve\u201d) and regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the \u201cOCC\u201d). The Bank has twenty-one (21) offices, including its headquarters, in Manitowoc, Outagamie, Brown, Winnebago, Sheboygan, Waupaca, Ozaukee, Monroe, and Jefferson counties in the State of Wisconsin. We serve businesses, professionals and consumers with a wide variety of financial services, including retail and commercial banking. Some of the products that we offer include checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, cash management accounts, certificates of deposit, commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, construction and development loans, residential mortgages, consumer loans, credit cards, online banking, telephone banking and mobile banking.\nThe Bank has four subsidiaries: UFS, LLC (\u201cUFS\u201d), Bank First Investments, Inc., TVG Holdings, Inc. (\u201cTVG\u201d) and BFC Title, LLC. UFS is a Wisconsin limited liability company organized in 2014, in which the Bank is a 49.8% member. UFS provides core data processing, endpoint management, cloud services, cyber security, and digital banking solutions to the Bank and many other community banks in and around Wisconsin.

It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank, and its purpose is to hold the Bank\u2019s 40% ownership interest in Ansay & Associates, LLC (\u201cAnsay\u201d). Ansay is one of the nation\u2019s largest independent insurance providers, and the Bank\u2019s minority ownership of Ansay allows the Bank to provide diversified services to our customers without the risk and expense of an in-house insurance department. BFC Title, LLC is a Wisconsin limited liability company organized in 2020.

For more information, see the Bank\u2019s website at www.bankfirst.com.\nRecent acquisitions\nPartnership Community Bancshares, Inc.\nOn July 12, 2019, the Company completed a merger with Partnership Community Bancshares, Inc. (\u201cPartnership\u201d), a bank holding company headquartered in Cedarburg, Wisconsin, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Bank Merger, dated as of January 22, 2019 and as amended on April 30, 2019, by and among the Company and Partnership, whereby Partnership merged with and into the Company, and Partnership Bank, Partnership\u2019s wholly-owned banking subsidiary, merged with and into the Bank.

The stock versus cash elections by the Partnership shareholders were subject to final consideration being made up of approximately $14.3 million in cash and 534,731 shares of Company common stock, valued at approximately $35.3 million (based on a value of $66.03 per share on the closing date).\n6\n\n\nTable of Contents\nTimberwood Bancshares, Inc.\nOn May 15, 2020, the Company completed a merger with Tomah Bancshares, Inc. (\"Timberwood\"), a bank holding company headquartered in Tomah, Wisconsin, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Bank Merger, dated as of November 20, 2019, by and among the Company and Timberwood, whereby Timberwood merged with and into the Company, and Timberwood Bank, Timberwood's wholly-owned banking subsidiary, merged with and into the Bank. Timberwood's principal activity was the ownership and operation of Timberwood Bank, a state-chartered banking institution that operated one (1) branch in Wisconsin at the time of closing. The merger consideration totaled approximately $29.8 million.\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Timberwood shareholders received 5.1445 shares of the Company's common stock for each outstanding share of Timberwood common stock, and cash in lieu of any remaining fractional share. Company stock issued totaled 575,641 shares valued at approximately $29.4 million, with cash of $0.4 million comprising the remainder of merger consideration.\nDenmark Bancshares, Inc.\nOn January 18, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Denmark Bancshares, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation, whereby Denmark will be merged with and into the Company. Pursuant to entering into the Merger Agreement, the Bank and Denmark\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary bank, Denmark State Bank, will enter into a Plan of Bank Merger whereby Denmark State Bank will be merged with and into the Bank immediately following the merger of Denmark with the Company. The Merger Agreement has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of the Company and Denmark. The transaction is expected to close in the early third quarter of 2022, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and shareholder approvals from both the Company\u2019s and Denmark\u2019s shareholders.\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Denmark shareholders will have the right to receive, at each shareholder\u2019s election, either $38.10 in cash or 0.5276 of a share of the Company\u2019s common stock, subject to share reconciliation, proration, and allocation procedures, such that at least 80% of Denmark shares will receive stock consideration and no more than 20% of Denmark shares will receive cash consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate merger consideration is subject to a downward adjustment if Denmark\u2019s tangible equity capital (as calculated per the Merger Agreement) is less than $67,565,297 at the time of closing of the Merger.\nThe Company accounts for these transactions under the acquisition method of accounting, and thus, the financial position and results of operations of acquired institutions prior to the consummation date are not included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The acquisition method of accounting requires assets purchased and liabilities assumed to be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The Company determines the fair value of core deposit intangibles, securities, premises and equipment, loans, other assets and liabilities, deposits and borrowings with the assistance of third party valuations, appraisals, and third party advisors. The estimated fair values are subject to refinement for up to one year after deal consummation as additional information becomes available relative to the closing date fair values.\nStrategic Plan\nThe Bank is a relationship-based community bank focused on providing innovative products and services that are value driven to the communities we serve. The Bank\u2019s culture celebrates diversity, creativity, and responsiveness, with the highest ethical standards. Employees are supported and encouraged to develop their careers. They are empowered with the tools to be successful and are held accountable for the results they deliver to our customers and shareholders. We maintain a strong credit culture as a foundation of sound asset quality, and we embrace innovation and provide the solutions our customers need and expect. The Bank\u2019s vision is to remain an independent community bank and plans to sustain its independence by remaining one of the top-performing providers of financial services in Wisconsin. The Bank focuses on creating value for its customers and shareholders by forging strong relationships and offering personalized and innovative solutions.\n7\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur strategic priorities are organized around the CAMELS ratings, including Capital, Asset Quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity, and Sensitivity to Market Rates.

Our branches are located in Brown, Jefferson, Manitowoc, Monroe, Outagamie, Ozaukee, Sheboygan, Waupaca, and Winnebago counties. Our main office is located at 402 N. 8th Street, Manitowoc, Wisconsin. In addition, we are currently in the process of constructing a new operations center along the I-43 corridor in Manitowoc. Furthermore, with the proposed acquisition of Denmark, we will also enter into the Shawano County upon the completion of the merger. Based on the deposit market share reports published by the FDIC on June 30, 2021, Bank First ranks in top two of market share in four of the nine counties in which its branches are located.\nThe nine counties in which the Bank has offices have an estimated aggregate population of 1,104,554, based on U.S. Census data, and total deposits of approximately $28.64 billion as of June 30, 2021, according to the most recent data published by the FDIC.\nCompetition\nThe banking business is highly competitive, and we face competition in our market areas from many other local, regional, and national financial institutions. Competition among financial institutions is based on interest rates offered on deposit accounts, interest rates charged on loans, other credit and service charges relating to loans, the quality and scope of the services rendered, the convenience of banking facilities, and, in the case of loans to commercial borrowers, relative lending limits. We compete with commercial banks, credit unions, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds and other mutual funds, fintech companies, as well as regional and national financial institutions that operate offices in our market areas and elsewhere. The competing major commercial banks have greater resources that may provide them a competitive advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous branch offices, mount extensive advertising campaigns and invest in new technologies. The increasingly competitive environment is the result of changes in regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems, additional financial service providers, and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers.\n8\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems.\nSome of our non-banking competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. In addition, some of our competitors have assets, capital and lending limits greater than that of the Bank, have greater access to capital markets and offer a broader range of products and services than the Bank. These institutions may have the ability to finance wide-ranging advertising campaigns and may also be able to offer lower rates on loans and higher rates on deposits than we can offer. Some of these institutions offer services, such as international banking, which we do not directly offer, except for a limited suite of services such as international wires and currency exchange.\nWe compete with these institutions by focusing on our position as an independent, community bank and rely upon local promotional activities, personal relationships established by our officers, directors, and employees with our customers, and specialized services tailored to meet the needs of the communities served. \u00a0We provide innovative products to our customers that are value-driven. We actively cultivate relationships with our customers that extend beyond a single loan to a full suite of products that serve the needs of our retail and commercial customers. Our goal is to develop long-standing connections with our customers and the communities that we serve. While our position varies by market, our management believes that it can compete effectively as a result of local market knowledge, local decision making, and awareness of customer needs.\nOur Business\nGeneral\nWe emphasize a range of lending services, including commercial and residential real estate loans, construction and development loans, commercial and industrial loans, and consumer loans. Our customers are generally individuals, small to medium-sized businesses and professional firms that are located in or conduct a substantial portion of their business in our market areas. At December 31, 2021, we had total loans receivable of $2.24 billion, representing approximately 81.9% of our total earning assets. As of December 31, 2021, we had 24 nonaccrual loans totaling approximately $7.2 million, or 0.3% of total loans. For additional discussion related to nonperforming loans, see the \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d section as well as the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nLoan\n \nApproval\nCertain credit risks are inherent in making loans. These include prepayment risks, risks resulting from uncertainties in the future value of collateral, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions, and risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers. We attempt to mitigate repayment risks by adhering to our comprehensive and robust internal credit policies and procedures. These policies and procedures include officer and customer lending limits, with approval process for larger loans, documentation examination, and follow-up procedures for any exceptions to credit policies. Our loan approval policies provide for various levels of officer lending authority. The Bank currently employs both a signature process through the line of business as well as credit administration and a committee process which involves the Bank\u2019s board of directors each month. Both approvals and reviews of the credit actions are underwritten by an independent set of credit analysts who report to credit administration. For our loan commitments, a serial sign-off process is utilized up to $5,000,000, requiring multiple signatures for a loan approval. This process ensures that the necessary parties at all authority levels are aware of and approve the commitment. The Bank\u2019s board of directors is involved in credits above this level after they have been through the serial sign-off process. We do not make any loans to any director, executive officer of the Bank, or the related interests of each, unless the loan is approved by the full board of directors of the Bank and is on terms not more favorable than would be available to a person not affiliated with the Bank.\n9\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCredit Administration and Loan Review\nOur loan review consists of both commercial and retail review where loan files are reviewed and risk ratings are validated. Both were fully outsourced by the end of 2019 to a firm that specializes in file review and risk rating. Our policy for reviewing commercial credit files consisted of selecting a percentage of specific files on an annual basis as defined in our loan review plan, and reviewing them for risk rating and policy compliance. Our retail review consists of selecting a percentage of specific files on an annual basis, and reviewing them for policy compliance.\nLending Limits\nOur lending activities are subject to a variety of lending limits imposed by federal law. In general, the Bank is subject to a legal limit on loans to a single borrower equal to 15% of the Bank\u2019s capital and unimpaired surplus. This legal lending limit will increase or decrease as the Bank\u2019s level of capital increases or decreases. In addition to the legal lending, management and the board of directors have established a more conservative, internal lending limit. The Bank\u2019s legal and internal lending limits are a safety and soundness measure intended to prevent one person or a relatively small and economically related group of persons from borrowing an unduly large amount of the Bank\u2019s funds. It is also intended to safeguard the Bank\u2019s depositors by diversifying the risk of loan losses among a relatively large number of creditworthy borrowers engaged in various types of businesses. Based upon the capitalization of the Bank at December 31, 2021, the Bank\u2019s legal lending limit was $43.8 million and the Bank\u2019s internal lending limit was $35.0 million. Our board of directors will adjust the internal lending limit as deemed necessary to continue to mitigate risk and serve the Bank\u2019s clients. We are also able to sell participations in our larger loans to other financial institutions, which allows us to manage the risk involved in these loans and to meet the lending needs of our clients requiring extensions of credit in excess of these limits.\nReal Estate Loans\nThe principal component of our loan portfolio is loans secured by real estate. Real estate loans are subject to the same general risks as other loans and are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in the value of real estate. Fluctuations in the value of real estate and rising interest rates, as well as other factors arising after a loan has been made, could negatively affect a borrower\u2019s cash flow, creditworthiness, and ability to repay the loan. We obtain a security interest in real estate whenever possible, in addition to any other available collateral, in order to increase the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan.\nAs of December 31, 2021, loans secured by real estate made up approximately $1.68 billion, or 75.3%, of our loan portfolio. These loans generally will fall into one of two categories:\n\u25cf\nCommercial Real Estate. \nCommercial real estate loans generally have terms of 10 years or less, although payments may be structured on a longer amortization basis. We evaluate each borrower on an individual basis and attempt to determine their business risks and credit profile. We attempt to reduce credit risk in the commercial real estate portfolio by emphasizing loans on owner-occupied industrial, office, and retail buildings where the loan-to-value ratio, established by independent appraisals, does not generally exceed 85% of cost or appraised value. We also generally require that a borrower\u2019s cash flow exceed 110% of monthly debt service obligations. In order to ensure secondary sources of payment and liquidity to support a loan request, we typically review all of the personal financial statements of the principal owners and require their personal guaranties. Commercial real estate loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans. They are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans and depend on cash flows from the owner\u2019s business or the property to service the debt. Because our loan portfolio contains a number of commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in our levels of nonperforming assets. As of December 31, 2021, commercial real estate loans made up approximately $1.11 billion or 49.7% of our loan portfolio.\n\u25cf\nResidential Mortgage Loans and Home Equity Loans. \u00a0 \nWe originate and hold short-term and long-term first mortgages and traditional second mortgage residential real estate loans. Generally, we limit the loan-to-value ratio on our residential real estate loans to 90%. We offer fixed and adjustable rate residential real estate loans with terms of up to 30 years. We also offer a variety of lot loan options to consumers to purchase the lot on which they intend build their home. We also offer traditional home equity loans and lines of credit. Our underwriting criteria for, and the risks associated with, home equity loans and lines of credit are generally the same as those for first mortgage loans. Home equity loans typically have terms of 20 years or less. We generally limit the extension of credit to 90% of the available equity of each property. As of December 31, 2021, residential mortgage loans and home equity loans made up approximately $571.8 million or 25.6% of our loan portfolio.\n10\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u200b\nCommercial and Industrial Loans\nWe have significant expertise in small to middle market commercial and industrial lending. Our success is the result of our product and market expertise, and our focus on delivering high-quality, customized and quick turnaround service for our clients due to our focus on maintaining an appropriate balance between prudent, disciplined underwriting, on the one hand, and flexibility in our decision making and responsiveness to our clients, on the other hand, which has allowed us to grow our commercial and industrial loan portfolio while maintaining strong asset quality. As of December 31, 2021, commercial and industrial loans made up approximately $366.2 million or 16.4% of our loan portfolio.\nWe provide a mix of variable and fixed rate commercial and industrial loans. The loans are typically made to small- and medium-sized businesses involved in professional services, accommodation and food services, health care, wholesale trade, financial institutions, manufacturing, distribution, retailing and non-profits. We extend commercial business loans for working capital, accounts receivable and inventory financing and other business purposes. Generally, short-term loans have maturities ranging from 3 months to 1 year, and \u201cterm loans\u201d have maturities ranging from 3 to 20 years. Lines of credit are generally intended to finance current transactions and typically provide for periodic principal payments, with interest payable monthly. Term loans generally provide for floating and fixed interest rates, with monthly payments of both principal and interest.\nConstruction and Development Loans\nWe offer fixed and adjustable rate residential and commercial construction loan financing to builders and developers and to consumers who wish to build their own home. The term of construction and development loans generally is limited to 9 to 24 months, although payments may be structured on a longer amortization basis. Most loans will mature and require payment in full upon completion and either the sale of the property or refinance into a permanent loan. We believe that construction and development loans generally carry a higher degree of risk than long-term financing of stabilized, rented, and owner-occupied properties because repayment depends on the ultimate completion of the project and usually on the subsequent sale of the property. Specific risks include:\n\u25cf\ncost overruns;\n\u25cf\nmismanaged construction;\n\u25cf\ninferior or improper construction techniques;\n\u25cf\neconomic changes or downturns during construction;\n\u25cf\na downturn in the real estate market;\n\u25cf\nrising interest rates which may prevent sale of the property; and\n\u25cf\nfailure to sell or stabilize completed projects in a timely manner.\n\u200b\nWe attempt to reduce risk associated with construction and development loans by obtaining personal guaranties and by keeping the maximum loan-to-value ratio at or below 85% of the lesser of cost or appraised value, depending on the project type. Generally, we do not have interest reserves built into loan commitments but require periodic cash payments for interest from the borrower\u2019s cash flow. As of December 31, 2021, construction and development loans made up approximately $132.5 million or 5.9% of our loan portfolio.\n11\n\n\nTable of Contents\nConsumer Loans\nWe make a variety of loans to individuals for personal and household purposes, including secured and unsecured installment loans and revolving lines of credit. Consumer loans are underwritten based on the borrower\u2019s income, current debt level, past credit history, and the availability and value of collateral. Consumer rates are both fixed and variable, with negotiable terms. Our installment loans typically amortize over periods up to seven years. Although we typically require monthly principal and interest payments on our loan products, we will offer consumer loans at interest only with a single maturity date when a specific source of repayment is available. Consumer loans are generally considered to have greater risk than first or second mortgages on real estate because they may be unsecured, or, if they are secured, the value of the collateral may be difficult to assess and more likely to decrease in value than real estate. \u00a0As of December 31, 2021, consumer loans made up approximately $32.1 million or 1.4% of our loan portfolio.\nMortgage Banking Activities\nOur mortgage banking operations include correspondent or secondary market lending, and in-house mortgage lending (included in residential mortgage and home equity loan totals above). We conduct secondary market lending through Fannie Mae, Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, and the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority. We also offer a number of in-house mortgage products, including adjustable rate mortgages at one, three, five, seven, ten, and fifteen years, and fixed rate mortgages at up to thirty years. We also offer an eleven-month construction loan, a construction to permanent loan, and a twelve-month bridge loan.\nDeposit Products\nWe offer a full range of traditional deposit services through our branch network in our market areas that are typically available in most banks and savings institutions, including checking accounts, commercial accounts, savings accounts and other time deposits of various types, ranging from money market accounts to long-term certificates of deposit. Transaction accounts and time deposits are tailored to and offered at rates competitive to those offered in our primary market areas. We also offer retirement accounts and health savings accounts. Our customers include individuals, businesses, associations, organizations and governmental authorities. We believe that our branch infrastructure will assist us in obtaining deposits from local customers in the future. Our deposits are insured by the FDIC up to statutory limits.\nSecurities\nWe manage our securities portfolio and cash to maintain adequate liquidity and to ensure the safety and preservation of invested principal, with a secondary focus on yield and returns. Specific goals of our investment portfolio are as follows:\n\u25cf\nprovide a ready source of balance sheet liquidity, ensuring adequate availability of funds to meet fluctuations in loan demand, deposit balances and other changes in balance sheet volumes and composition;\n\u25cf\nserve as a means for diversification of our assets with respect to credit quality, maturity and other attributes;\n\u25cf\nserve as a tool for modifying our interest rate risk profile pursuant to our established policies; and\n\u25cf\nprovide collateral to secure municipal and business deposits.\nOur investment portfolio is comprised primarily of U.S. government securities, mortgage-backed securities backed by government-sponsored entities, and taxable and tax-exempt municipal securities.\nOur investment policy is reviewed annually by our board of directors. Overall investment goals are established by our board, CEO, and members of our Asset Liability Committee (\u201cALCO\u201d). Our board of directors has delegated the responsibility of monitoring our investment activities to our ALCO. Day-to-day activities pertaining to the securities portfolio are conducted under the supervision of our CEO. We actively monitor our investments on an ongoing basis to identify any material changes in the securities. We also review our securities for potential other-than-temporary impairment at least quarterly.\n12\n\n\nTable of Contents\nHuman Capital Resources\n\u200b\nThroughout COVID-19, the health and safety of our employees, customers, and communities we serve has been our top priority, and we continue to do our best to update guidelines and practices in accordance with recommendations by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and new data as it becomes available. In response to COVID-19, we quickly implemented extensive safety measures to protect our employees, including heightened sanitary precautions, protective supplies, suspended non-essential business travel, directed employees to work remotely when possible and limited in-person meetings. We also implemented flexible scheduling and compensation arrangements for employees affected by COVID-19.\nOur Company culture emphasizes our longstanding dedication to being respectful to others and having a workforce that is representative of the communities we serve. Diversity, equity and inclusion are fundamental to our culture. We believe in attracting, retaining and promoting quality talent and recognize that diversity makes us stronger as a Company. Our talent acquisition teams partner with hiring managers in sourcing and presenting a diverse slate of qualified candidates to strengthen our organization.\nWe believe employees to be our greatest asset and that our future success depends on our ability to attract, retain and develop employees. Professional development is a key priority, which is facilitated through our many corporate development initiatives including extensive training programs, corporate mentoring, leadership programs, educational reimbursement and professional speaker series.\nAs part of our effort to attract and retain employees, we offer a broad range of benefits, including health, dental and vision insurance, life and disability insurance, cell phone and health club reimbursement, an employee assistance program, educational tuition reimbursement, annual clothing allowance, an employee referral program, 401(k) retirement plan, profit sharing, a flex spending cafeteria plan, and generous paid time off. We believe our compensation package and benefits are competitive with others in our industry. For additional information regarding our employee benefit plans, see \u201cNote 17 \u2013 Employee Benefit Plans\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\u200b\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 287 FTEs. None of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit or is a party to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements.\nGeneral Corporate Information\nOur principal executive offices are located at 402 N. 8th Street, Manitowoc, Wisconsin 54220, and our telephone number at that address is (920) 652-3100.

The following is a brief summary that does not purport to be a complete description of all regulations that affect us or all aspects of those regulations. This discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions described below and is not intended to be an exhaustive description of the statutes or regulations applicable to the Company\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s business. In addition, proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently raised at both the state and federal levels. The likelihood and timing of any changes in these laws and regulations, and the impact such changes may have on us and the Bank, are difficult to predict. In addition, bank regulatory agencies may issue enforcement actions, policy statements, interpretive letters and similar written guidance applicable to us or the Bank. Changes in applicable laws, regulations or regulatory guidance, or their interpretation by regulatory agencies or courts may have a material adverse effect on our and the Bank\u2019s business, operations, and earnings. Supervision and regulation of banks, their holding companies and affiliates is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and customers, the Deposit Insurance Fund (\u201cDIF\u201d) of the FDIC, and the U.S. banking and financial system rather than holders of our capital stock.\nRegulation of the Company \nWe are registered as a bank holding company with the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the \u201cBHC Act\u201d). As such, we are subject to comprehensive supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve and are subject to its regulatory reporting requirements. Federal law subjects bank holding companies, such as the Company, to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations. Violations of laws and regulations, or other unsafe and unsound practices, may result in regulatory agencies imposing fines or penalties, cease-and-desist orders, or taking other enforcement actions. Under certain circumstances, these agencies may enforce these remedies directly against officers, directors, employees and other parties participating in the affairs of a bank or bank holding company.\nActivity Limitations. \u00a0 \nBank holding companies are generally restricted to engaging in the business of banking, managing or controlling banks and certain other activities determined by the Federal Reserve to be closely related to banking. In addition, the Federal Reserve has the power to order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any nonbanking activity or terminate its ownership or control of any nonbank subsidiary, when it has reasonable cause to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of any bank subsidiary of that bank holding company.\nSource of Strength Obligations. \u00a0 \nA bank holding company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and to maintain resources adequate to support its bank. The term \u201csource of financial strength\u201d means the ability of a company, such as us, that directly or indirectly owns or controls an insured depository institution, such as the Bank, to provide financial assistance to such insured depository institution in the event of financial distress. The appropriate federal banking agency for the depository institution (in the case of the Bank, this agency is the OCC) may require reports from us to assess our ability to serve as a source of strength and to enforce compliance with the source of strength requirements by requiring us to provide financial assistance to the Bank in the event of financial distress. If we were to enter bankruptcy or become subject to the orderly liquidation process established by the Dodd-Frank Act, any commitment by us to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of the Bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee or the FDIC, as appropriate, and entitled to a priority of payment.\n14\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAcquisitions. \u00a0 \nThe BHC Act permits acquisitions of banks by bank holding companies, such that we and any other bank holding company, whether located in Wisconsin or elsewhere, may acquire a bank located in any other state, subject to certain deposit-percentage, age of bank charter requirements, and other restrictions. The BHC Act requires that a bank holding company obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before (i) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any additional bank or bank holding company, (ii) taking any action that causes an additional bank or bank holding company to become a subsidiary of the bank holding company, or (iii) merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company. The Federal Reserve may not approve any such transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any section of the United States, or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any section of the country, or that in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider: (1) the financial and managerial resources of the companies involved, including pro forma capital ratios; (2) the risk to the stability of the United States banking or financial system; (3) the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including performance under the Community Reinvestment Act (\"CRA\"); and (4) the effectiveness of the companies in combatting money laundering.\nChange in Control. \u00a0 \nFederal law restricts the amount of voting stock of a bank holding company or a bank that a person may acquire without the prior approval of banking regulators. Under the Change in Bank Control Act and the regulations thereunder, a person or group must give advance notice to the Federal Reserve before acquiring control of any bank holding company, such as the Company, and the OCC before acquiring control of any national bank, such as the Bank. Upon receipt of such notice, the bank regulatory agencies may approve or disapprove the acquisition. The Change in Bank Control Act creates a rebuttable presumption of control if a person or group acquires the power to vote 10% or more of our outstanding common stock. The overall effect of such laws is to make it more difficult to acquire a bank holding company and a bank by tender offer or similar means than it might be to acquire control of another type of corporation. Consequently, shareholders of the Company may be less likely to benefit from the rapid increases in stock prices that may result from tender offers or similar efforts to acquire control of other companies. Investors should be aware of these requirements when acquiring shares of our stock.\nGovernance and Financial Reporting Obligations. \nWe are required to comply with various corporate governance and financial reporting requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules and regulations adopted by the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), and Nasdaq. In particular, we are required to include management and independent registered public accounting firm reports on internal controls as part of our Annual Report on Form 10- K in order to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have evaluated our controls, including compliance with the SEC rules on internal controls, and have and expect to continue to spend significant amounts of time and money on compliance with these rules. Our failure to comply with these internal control rules may materially adversely affect our reputation, ability to obtain the necessary certifications to financial statements, and the values of our securities. The assessments of our financial reporting controls as of December 31, 2021 are included in this report under \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\u201d\nCorporate Governance. \u00a0 \nThe Dodd-Frank Act addresses many investor protections, corporate governance, and executive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies. The Dodd-Frank Act (1) grants shareholders of U.S. publicly traded companies an advisory vote on executive compensation; (2) enhances independence requirements for Compensation Committee members; and (3) requires companies listed on national securities exchanges to adopt incentive-based compensation claw-back policies for executive officers.\n15\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIncentive Compensation. \u00a0 \nThe Dodd-Frank Act required the banking agencies and the SEC to establish joint rules or guidelines for financial institutions with more than $1 billion in assets, such as us and the Bank, which prohibit incentive compensation arrangements that the agencies determine to encourage inappropriate risks by the institution. The banking agencies issued proposed rules in 2011 and previously issued guidance on sound incentive compensation policies. In 2016, the Federal Reserve and the OCC also proposed rules that would, depending upon the assets of the institution, directly regulate incentive compensation arrangements and would require enhanced oversight and recordkeeping. As of December 31, 2021, these rules have not been implemented. We and the Bank have undertaken efforts to ensure that our incentive compensation plans do not encourage inappropriate risks, consistent with three key principles\u2014 that incentive compensation arrangements should appropriately balance risk and financial rewards, be compatible with effective controls and risk management, and be supported by strong corporate governance.\nShareholder Say-On-Pay Votes. \u00a0\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies to take shareholders\u2019 votes on proposals addressing compensation (known as say-on-pay), the frequency of a say-on-pay vote, and the golden parachutes available to executives in connection with change-in-control transactions. Public companies must give shareholders the opportunity to vote on the compensation at least every three years and the opportunity to vote on frequency at least every six years, indicating whether the say-on-pay vote should be held annually, biennially, or triennially. The say-on-pay, the say-on-parachute and the say-on-frequency votes are explicitly nonbinding and cannot override a decision of our board of directors.\nOther Regulatory Matters\n. \u00a0 We and our subsidiaries are subject to oversight by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, (\u201cFINRA\u201d), the PCAOB, Nasdaq and various state securities regulators. We and our subsidiaries have from time to time received requests for information from regulatory authorities in various states, including state attorneys general, securities regulators and other regulatory authorities, concerning our business practices. Such requests are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business.\nCapital Requirements\nThe Bank is required under federal law to maintain certain minimum capital levels based on ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. The required capital ratios are minimums, and the federal banking agencies may determine that a banking organization, based on its size, complexity or risk profile, must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. Risks such as concentration of credit risks and the risks arising from non-traditional activities, as well as the institution\u2019s exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates, and an institution\u2019s ability to manage those risks are important factors that are to be taken into account by the federal banking agencies in assessing an institution\u2019s overall capital adequacy. The following is a brief description of the relevant provisions of these capital rules and their potential impact on our capital levels.\nThe Bank is subject to the following risk-based capital ratios: a common equity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d) risk-based capital ratio, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, which includes CET1 and additional Tier 1 capital, and a total capital ratio, which includes Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. CET1 is primarily comprised of the sum of common stock instruments and related surplus net of treasury stock, retained earnings, and certain qualifying minority interests, less certain adjustments and deductions, including with respect to goodwill, intangible assets, mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets subject to temporary timing differences. Additional Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, tier 1 minority interests and grandfathered trust preferred securities. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments disqualified from Tier 1 capital, including qualifying subordinated debt, other preferred stock and certain hybrid capital instruments, and a limited amount of loan loss reserves up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, subject to certain eligibility criteria. The capital rules also define the risk-weights assigned to assets and off-balance sheet items to determine the risk-weighted asset components of the risk-based capital rules, including, for example, certain \u201chigh volatility\u201d commercial real estate, past due assets, structured securities and equity holdings.\nThe leverage capital ratio, which serves as a minimum capital standard, is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to quarterly average assets net of goodwill, certain other intangible assets, and certain required deduction items. The required minimum leverage ratio for all banks is 4.0%.\n16\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, the capital rules require a capital conservation buffer of CET1 of 2.5% above each of the minimum capital ratio requirements (CET1, Tier 1, and total risk-based capital), which is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. These buffer requirements must be met for a bank to be able to pay dividends, engage in share buybacks or make discretionary bonus payments to executive management without restriction.\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (\u201cFDICIA\u201d), among other things, requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to take \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d regarding depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five regulatory capital tiers: \u201cwell capitalized\u201d, \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d, \u201cundercapitalized\u201d, \u201csignificantly undercapitalized\u201d, and \u201ccritically undercapitalized\u201d. A depository institution\u2019s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized.\nTo be well-capitalized, the Bank must maintain at least the following capital ratios:\n\u25cf\n6.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets;\n\u25cf\n8.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets;\n\u25cf\n10.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets; and\n\u25cf\n5.0% leverage ratio.\nFailure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on our operations or financial condition. For example, only a well-capitalized depository institution may accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could also result in restrictions on the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications or other restrictions on its growth. The Bank was well capitalized at December 31, 2021, and brokered deposits are not restricted.\nIn 2021, the Bank\u2019s regulatory capital ratios were above the applicable well-capitalized standards and met the then-applicable capital conservation buffer. Based on current estimates, we believe that the Bank will continue to exceed all applicable well-capitalized regulatory capital requirements and the capital conservation buffer in 2022.\nThe Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cEconomic Growth Act\u201d) signed into law in May 2018 scaled back certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and provided other regulatory relief. Among the provisions of the Economic Growth Act was a requirement that the Federal Reserve raise the asset threshold for those bank holding companies subject to the Federal Reserve\u2019s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement (\u201cPolicy Statement\u201d) to $3 billion. As a result, as of the effective date of that change in 2018, the Company was no longer required to comply with the risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bank as described above. The Federal Reserve may however, require smaller bank holding companies subject to the Policy Statement to maintain certain minimum capital levels, depending upon general economic conditions and a bank holding company\u2019s particular condition, risk profile and growth plans.\n17\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAs a result of the Economic Growth Act, the federal banking agencies were also required to develop a \u201cCommunity Bank Leverage Ratio\u201d (the ratio of a bank\u2019s Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets) for financial institutions with assets of less than $10 billion. A \u201cqualifying community bank\u201d that exceeds this ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements, including the capital requirements to be considered \u201cwell capitalized\u201d under prompt corrective action statutes. The federal banking agencies may consider a financial institutions risk profile when evaluation whether it qualifies as a community bank for purposes of the capital ratio requirement. The federal banking agencies set the minimum capital for the new Community Bank Leverage Ratio at 9%. The Bank does not intend to opt into the Community Bank Leverage Ratio Framework.\nOn December 21, 2018, federal banking agencies issued a joint final rule to revise their regulatory capital rules to (i) address the upcoming implementation of the \u201ccurrent expected credit losses\u201d (\u201cCECL\u201d) accounting standard under GAAP; (ii) provide an optional three-year phase-in period for the day-one adverse regulatory capital effects that banking organizations are expected to experience upon adopting CECL; and (iii) require the use of CECL in stress tests beginning with the 2020 capital planning and stress testing cycle for certain banking organizations. for more information regarding Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, which introduced CECL as the methodology to replace the current \u201cincurred loss\u201d methodology for financial assets measured at amortized cost, and changed the approaches for recognizing and recording credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased credit impaired financial assets, including the required implementation date for the Company, see the notes to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nPayment of Dividends\nWe are a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and our other subsidiaries. Our primary source of cash, other than securities offerings, is dividends from the Bank. The prior approval of the OCC is required if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank (such as the Bank) in any calendar year will exceed the sum of such bank\u2019s net profits for that year and its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to surplus. Federal law also prohibits any national bank from paying dividends that would be greater than such bank\u2019s undivided profits after deducting statutory bad debts in excess of such bank\u2019s allowance for possible loan losses.\nIn addition, we and the Bank are subject to various general regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums. The appropriate federal bank regulatory authority may prohibit the payment of dividends where it has determined that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. The OCC and the Federal Reserve have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a bank\u2019s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsound and unsafe banking practice. The OCC and the Federal Reserve have each indicated that depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings.\nUnder a Federal Reserve policy adopted in 2009, the board of directors of a bank holding company must consider different factors to ensure that its dividend level is prudent relative to maintaining a strong financial position, and is not based on overly optimistic earnings scenarios, such as potential events that could affect its ability to pay, while still maintaining a strong financial position. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company should consult with the Federal Reserve and eliminate, defer or significantly reduce the bank holding company\u2019s dividends if:\n\u25cf\nits net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends;\n\u25cf\nits prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with its capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or\n\u25cf\nit will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.\nPrior approval by the OCC is required if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year exceeds the bank\u2019s profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years.\n18\n\n\nTable of Contents\nRegulation of the Bank\nAs a national bank, our primary bank subsidiary, Bank First, N.A., is subject to comprehensive supervision and regulation by the OCC and is subject to its regulatory reporting requirements. The deposits of the Bank are insured by the FDIC up to applicable limits and, accordingly, the Bank is also subject to certain FDIC regulations and the FDIC has backup examination authority and some enforcement powers over the Bank. The Bank also is subject to certain Federal Reserve regulations.\nIn addition, as discussed in more detail below, the Bank and any other of our subsidiaries that offer consumer financial products and services are subject to regulation and potential supervision by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d). Authority to supervise and examine the Company and the Bank for compliance with federal consumer laws remains largely with the Federal Reserve and the OCC, respectively. However, the CFPB may participate in examinations on a \u201csampling basis\u201d and may refer potential enforcement actions against such institutions to their primary regulators. The CFPB also may participate in examinations of our other direct or indirect subsidiaries that offer consumer financial products or services. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the CFPB, and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce certain federal consumer financial protection rules adopted by the CFPB. As the Company and the Bank each had less than $10 billion in consolidated assets in 2021, they are not subject to the routine supervision of the CFPB, but this may change in the future as the Company and the Bank grow.\nBroadly, regulations applicable to the Bank include limitations on loans to a single borrower and to its directors, officers and employees; restrictions on the opening and closing of branch offices; the maintenance of required capital and liquidity ratios; the granting of credit under equal and fair conditions; the disclosure of the costs and terms of such credit; requirements to maintain reserves against deposits and loans; limitations on the types of investment that may be made by the Bank; and requirements governing risk management practices. The Bank is permitted under federal law to branch on a de novo basis across state lines where the laws of that state would permit a bank chartered by that state to open a de novo branch.\nTransactions with Affiliates and Insiders. \nThe Bank is subject to restrictions on extensions of credit and certain other transactions between the Bank and the Company or any nonbank affiliate. Generally, these covered transactions with either the Company or any affiliate are limited to 10% of the Bank\u2019s capital and surplus, and all such transactions between the Bank and the Company and all of its nonbank affiliates combined are limited to 20% of the Bank\u2019s capital and surplus. Loans and other extensions of credit from the Bank to the Company or any affiliate generally are required to be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts. In addition, any transaction between the Bank and the Company or any affiliate are required to be on an arm\u2019s length basis. Federal banking laws also place similar restrictions on certain extensions of credit by insured banks, such as the Bank, to their directors, executive officers and principal shareholders.\nReserves. \u00a0 \nHistorically, Federal Reserve rules required depository institutions, such as the Bank, to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts, primarily interest bearing and non-interest bearing checking accounts. The Federal Reserve announced that reserve requirement ratios were reduced to zero percent effective March 26, 2020. This action eliminated reserve requirements for all depository institutions.\nFDIC Insurance Assessments and Depositor Preference. \u00a0 \nThe Bank\u2019s deposits are insured by the FDIC\u2019s DIF up to the limits under applicable law, which currently are set at $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category. The Bank is subject to FDIC assessments for its deposit insurance. The FDIC calculates quarterly deposit insurance assessments based on an institution\u2019s average total consolidated assets less its average tangible equity, and applies one of four risk categories determined by reference to its capital levels, supervisory ratings, and certain other factors. The assessment rate schedule can change from time to time, at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to certain limits.\nInsurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by a bank\u2019s federal regulatory agency. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution, including those of the parent bank holding company.\n19\n\n\nTable of Contents\nStandards for Safety and Soundness. \u00a0 \nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe, by regulation or guideline, operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions relating to: (1) internal controls; (2) information systems and audit systems; (3) loan documentation; (4) credit underwriting; (5) interest rate risk exposure; and (6) asset quality. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement these required standards. These guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Under the regulations, if a regulator determines that a bank fails to meet any standards prescribed by the guidelines, the regulator may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance, consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans.\nAnti-Money Laundering\n. A continued focus of governmental policy relating to financial institutions in recent years has been combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act broadened the application of anti-money laundering regulations to apply to additional types of financial institutions such as broker-dealers, investment advisors and insurance companies, and strengthened the ability of the U.S. government to help prevent, detect and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The principal provisions of Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act require that regulated financial institutions: (i) establish an anti-money laundering program that includes training and audit components; (ii) comply with regulations regarding the verification of the identity of any person seeking to open an account; (iii) take additional required precautions with non-U.S. owned accounts; and (iv) perform certain verification and certification of money laundering risk for their foreign correspondent banking relationships. Failure of a financial institution to comply with the USA PATRIOT Act's requirements could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. The Bank has augmented its systems and procedures to meet the requirements of these regulations and will continue to revise and update its policies, procedures and controls to reflect changes required by law.\nFinCEN has adopted rules that require financial institutions to obtain beneficial ownership information with respect to legal entities with which such institutions conduct business, subject to certain exclusions and exemptions. Bank regulators are focusing their examinations on anti-money laundering compliance, and we continue to monitor and augment, where necessary, our anti-money laundering compliance programs.\nBanking regulators will consider compliance with the Act's money laundering provisions in acting upon merger and acquisition proposals.\nBank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these anti-money laundering obligations and recently have been active in imposing \u201ccease-and-desist\u201d and other regulatory orders and money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be in violation of these requirements. Sanctions for violations of the Act can be imposed in an amount equal to twice the sum involved in the violating transaction, up to $1 million. On January 1, 2021, Congress passed federal legislation that made sweeping changes to federal anti-money laundering laws to be implemented in subsequent years.\nEconomic Sanctions\n. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and acts of Congress. OFAC publishes, and routinely updates, lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, including the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List. If we find a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, we must undertake certain specified activities, which could include blocking or freezing the account or transaction requested, and we must notify the appropriate authorities.\nConcentrations in Lending\n. \u00a0During 2006, the federal bank regulatory agencies released guidance on \u201cConcentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending\u201d (the \u201cGuidance\u201d) and advised financial institutions of the risks posed by commercial real estate (\u201cCRE\u201d) lending concentrations. The Guidance requires that appropriate processes be in place to identify, monitor and control risks associated with real estate lending concentrations. Higher allowances for loan losses and capital levels may also be required. The Guidance is triggered when CRE loan concentrations exceed either:\n\u25cf\nTotal reported loans for construction, land development, and other land of 100% or more of a bank\n\u2019\ns total risk-based capital; or\n\u25cf\nTotal reported loans secured by multifamily and nonfarm nonresidential properties and loans for construction, land development, and other land of 300% or more of a bank\n\u2019\ns total risk-based capital.\n20\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe Guidance also applies when a bank has a sharp increase in CRE loans or has significant concentrations of CRE secured by a particular property type. See Item 1A. Risk Factors -- \nWe have a concentration in commercial real estate lending which could cause our regulators to restrict our ability to grow\n \u2013 for a discussion of our risks regarding CRE exposure.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act.\n The Bank is subject to the provisions of the CRA, which imposes a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with their safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of entire communities where the Bank accepts deposits, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The OCC\u2019s assessment of the Bank\u2019s CRA record is made available to the public. Further, a less than satisfactory CRA rating will slow, if not preclude, expansion of banking activities. Following the enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (\u201cGLB\u201d), CRA agreements with private parties must be disclosed and annual CRA reports must be made to a bank\u2019s primary federal regulator. Federal CRA regulations require, among other things, that evidence of discrimination against applicants on a prohibited basis, and illegal or abusive lending practices be considered in the CRA evaluation. In May 2020, the OCC issued new final regulations meant to strengthen and modernize the CRA regulations, with an effective date of October 1, 2020. However, on December 14, 2021, the OCC issued a final rule rescinding its 2020 CRA Rule and replacing it with a rule based largely on the prior rules adopted jointly by the federal banking agencies in 1995. The Bank had a rating of \u201cSatisfactory\u201d in its most recent CRA evaluation.\nPrivacy and Data Security. \u00a0 \nThe GLB generally prohibits disclosure of consumer information to non-affiliated third parties unless the consumer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure. Financial institutions are further required to disclose their privacy policies to customers annually. Financial institutions, however, will be required to comply with state law if it is more protective of consumer privacy than the GLB. The GLB also directed federal regulators, including the FDIC and the OCC, to prescribe standards for the security of consumer information. The Bank is subject to such standards, as well as standards for notifying customers in the event of a security breach. Under federal law, the Bank must disclose its privacy policy to consumers, permit customers to opt out of having nonpublic customer information disclosed to third parties in certain circumstances, and allow customers to opt out of receiving marketing solicitations based on information about the customer received from another subsidiary. States may adopt more extensive privacy protections. We are similarly required to have an information security program to safeguard the confidentiality and security of customer information and to ensure proper disposal. Customers must be notified when unauthorized disclosure involves sensitive customer information that may be misused. On November 18, 2021, the federal banking agencies issued a new rule effective in 2022 that requires banks to notify their regulators within 36 hours of a \u201ccomputer-security incident\u201d that rises to the level of a \u201cnotification incident.\u201d\nFurthermore, the federal banking regulators regularly issue guidance regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management. A financial institution is expected to implement multiple lines of defense against cyberattacks and ensure that their risk management procedures address the risk posed by potential cyber threats. A financial institution is further expected to maintain procedures to effectively respond to a cyberattack and resume operations following any such attack. The Company has adopted and implemented an Information Security Program to comply with the regulatory cybersecurity guidance.\nConsumer Regulation. \nActivities of the Bank are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers. These laws and regulations include, among numerous other things, provisions that:\n\u25cf\nlimit the interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank, including new rules respecting the terms of credit cards and of debit card overdrafts;\n\u25cf\ngovern the Bank\u2019s disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;\n\u25cf\nrequire the Bank to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether it is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;\n\u25cf\nprohibit the Bank from discriminating on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors when it makes decisions to extend credit;\n\u25cf\ngovern the manner in which the Bank may collect consumer debts; and\n21\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u25cf\nprohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in the provision of consumer financial products and services.\nMortgage Regulation. \u00a0\nThe CFPB adopted a rule that implements the ability-to-repay and qualified mortgage provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (the \u201cATR/QM rule\u201d), which requires lenders to consider, among other things, income, employment status, assets, payment amounts, and credit history before approving a mortgage, and provides a compliance \u201csafe harbor\u201d for lenders that issue certain \u201cqualified mortgages.\u201d The ATR/QM rule defines a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d to have certain specified characteristics, and generally prohibit loans with negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years from being qualified mortgages. The rule also establishes general underwriting criteria for qualified mortgages, including that monthly payments be calculated based on the highest payment that will apply in the first five years of the loan and that the borrower have a total debt-to-income ratio that is less than or equal to 43%. While \u201cqualified mortgages\u201d will generally be afforded safe harbor status, a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay requirements will attach to \u201cqualified mortgages\u201d that are \u201chigher priced mortgages\u201d (which are generally subprime loans). In addition, the securitizer of asset-backed securities must retain not less than 5 percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the asset-backed securities, unless subject to an exemption for asset-backed securities that are collateralized exclusively by residential mortgages that qualify as \u201cqualified residential mortgages.\u201d\nThe CFPB has also issued rules to implement requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act pertaining to mortgage loan origination (including with respect to loan originator compensation and loan originator qualifications) as well as integrated mortgage disclosure rules. In addition, the CFPB has issued rules that require servicers to comply with new standards and practices with regard to: error correction; information disclosure; force-placement of insurance; information management policies and procedures; requiring information about mortgage loss mitigation options be provided to delinquent borrowers; providing delinquent borrowers access to servicer personnel with continuity of contact about the borrower\u2019s mortgage loan account; and evaluating borrowers\u2019 applications for available loss mitigation options. These rules also address initial rate adjustment notices for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), periodic statements for residential mortgage loans, and prompt crediting of mortgage payments and response to requests for payoff amounts.\nIn 2020, the CARES Act granted certain forbearance rights and protection against foreclosure to borrowers with a \"federally backed mortgage loan,\" including certain first or subordinate lien loans designed principally for the occupancy of one to four families. These consumer protections continued during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNon-Discrimination Policies. \u00a0 \nThe Bank is also subject to, among other things, the provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (\u201cECOA\u201d) and the Fair Housing Act (\u201cFHA\u201d), both of which prohibit discrimination based on race or color, religion, national origin, sex, and familial status in any aspect of a consumer or commercial credit or residential real estate transaction. The Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d), and the federal bank regulatory agencies have issued an Interagency Policy Statement on Discrimination in Lending that provides guidance to financial institutions in determining whether discrimination exists, how the agencies will respond to lending discrimination, and what steps lenders might take to prevent discriminatory lending practices. The DOJ has increased its efforts to prosecute what it regards as violations of the ECOA and FHA.\n\u200b", "item1a": ">ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the risk factors and uncertainties discussed in our other public filings with the SEC under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in evaluating us and our business and making or continuing an investment in our stock. Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited, to the material risks described below. Many of these risks are beyond our control although efforts are made to manage those risks while simultaneously optimizing operational and financial results. The occurrence of any of the following risks, as well as risks of which we are currently unaware or currently deem immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our assets, business, cash flows, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects, results of operations and the trading price of our common stock. It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could materially and adversely affect our assets, business, cash flows, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects, results of operations and the trading price of our common stock.\n22\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, certain statements in the following risk factors constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to the section entitled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d beginning on page 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-\u00a0K.\nRisks related to our business\nDifficult or volatile conditions in the national financial markets, and the U.S. economy generally, may adversely affect our lending activity or other businesses, as well as our financial condition.\nOur business and financial performance are vulnerable to weak economic conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally or specifically in the state of Wisconsin, the principal market in which we conduct business. A deterioration in economic conditions in our primary market areas caused by inflation, recession, pandemics, outbreaks of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences, unemployment, plant or business closings or downsizing, changes in securities markets or other factors could result in the following consequences, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business: increased loan delinquencies; problem assets and foreclosures; significant write-downs of asset values; lower demand for our products and services; reduced low cost or noninterest-bearing deposits; intangible asset impairment; and collateral for loans made by us, especially real estate, may decline in value, in turn reducing our customers\u2019 ability to repay outstanding loans, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our existing loans.\nEffective March 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered the target range for the federal funds rate to a range from 0 to 0.25 percent in response to the economic disruption that occurred at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has continued into 2022. We expect a long duration of reduced interest rates to negatively impact our net interest income, margin, cost of borrowing and future profitability and to have a material adverse effect on our financial results. However, we expect the Federal Reserve to raise rates more than once in the next twelve months. \u00a0Increasing interest rates can have a negative impact on our business by reducing the amount of money our customers borrow or by adversely affecting their ability to repay outstanding loan balances that may increase due to adjustments in their variable rates. In addition, in a rising interest rate environment we may have to offer more attractive interest rates to depositors to compete for deposits, or pursue other sources of liquidity, such as wholesale funds. Higher income volatility from changes in interest rates and spreads to benchmark indices could result in a decrease in net interest income and a decrease in current fair market values of our assets. Fluctuations in interest rates impacts both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our net income, operating results, or financial condition. A prolonged period of volatile and unstable market conditions would likely increase our funding costs and negatively affect market risk mitigation strategies.\nAdditionally, we conduct our banking operations primarily in Wisconsin. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 95.51% of our loans and approximately 96.67% of our deposits were made to borrowers or received from depositors who live and/or primarily conduct business in Wisconsin. Therefore, our success will depend in large part upon the general economic conditions in this area, which we cannot predict with certainty. This geographic concentration imposes risks from lack of geographic diversification, as adverse economic developments in Wisconsin, among other things, could affect the volume of loan originations, increase the level of nonperforming assets, increase the rate of foreclosure losses on loans and reduce the value of our loans and loan servicing portfolio. Any regional or local economic downturn that affects Wisconsin or existing or prospective borrowers or property values in such areas may affect us and our profitability more significantly and adversely than our competitors whose operations are less geographically concentrated.\n23\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe face strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking services.\nWe conduct our banking operations primarily in Wisconsin. Many of our competitors offer the same, or a wider variety of, banking services within our market areas, and we compete with them for the same customers. These competitors include banks with nationwide operations, regional banks and community banks. In many instances these national and regional banks have greater resources than we do, and the smaller community banks may have stronger ties in local markets than we do, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including fintech companies, thrift institutions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, credit unions, mortgage banks and other financial intermediaries. In addition, a number of out-of-state financial institutions have opened offices and solicit deposits in our market areas. Increased competition in our markets may result in reduced loans and deposits, as well as reduced net interest margin and profitability. We compete with many forms of payments offered by both bank and non-bank providers, including a variety of new and evolving alternative payment mechanisms, systems and products, such as aggregators and web-based and wireless payment platforms or technologies, digital or \u201ccrypto\u201d currencies, prepaid systems and payment services targeting users of social networks, communications platforms and online gaming. Our future success may depend, in part, on our ability to use technology competitively to offer products and services that provide convenience to customers and create additional efficiencies in our operations. If we are unable to attract and retain banking clients, we may be unable to continue to grow our loan and deposit portfolios, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf we do not effectively manage our asset quality and credit risk, we could experience loan losses.\nMaking any loan involves various risks, including risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers, risks of nonpayment, risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral and cash flows available to service debt, and risks resulting from changes in economic and market conditions. Our credit risk approval and monitoring procedures may fail to identify or reduce these credit risks, and they cannot completely eliminate all credit risks related to our loan portfolio. If the overall economic climate, including employment rates, real estate markets, interest rates and general economic growth, in the United States, generally, or Wisconsin, specifically, experiences material disruption, our borrowers may experience difficulties in repaying their loans, the collateral we hold may decrease in value or become illiquid, and the levels of nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise and require additional provisions for loan losses, which would cause our net income and return on equity to decrease. The future effects of the continued COVID-19 pandemic on economic activity could negatively affect the collateral values associated with our existing loans, the ability to liquidate the real estate collateral securing our residential and commercial real estate loans, our ability to maintain loan origination volume and to obtain additional financing, the future demand for or profitability of our lending and services, and the financial condition and credit risk of our customers. Further, in the event of delinquencies, regulatory changes and policies designed to protect borrowers may slow or prevent us from making our business decisions or may result in a delay in our taking certain remediation actions, such as foreclosure. If borrowers fail to repay their loans, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur provision and allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual credit losses.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan and lease portfolio and utilize these assumptions and judgments when determining the provision and allowance for loan losses. The determination of the appropriate level of the provision for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes, as we have experienced. Deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the amount reserved in the allowance for loan losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our provision and the total allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses or future provisions for loan losses, based on judgments different than those of management. Any increases in the provision or allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in our net income and, potentially, capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\n24\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe current expected credit loss standard established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board will require significant data requirements and changes to methodologies.\nIn the aftermath of the 2007-2008 financial crisis, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, decided to review how banks estimate losses in the ALL calculations, and it issued the final Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, standard on June 16, 2016. Currently, the impairment model used by financial institutions is based on incurred losses, and loans are recognized as impaired when there is no longer an assumption that future cash flows will be collected in full under the originally contracted terms. This model will be replaced by the CECL model that will become effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2022 in which financial institutions will be required to use historical information, current conditions, and reasonable forecasts to estimate the expected loss over the life of the loan. The Company will record a one-time adjustment to its credit loss allowance, as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2023, equal to the difference between the amounts of its credit loss allowance under the incurred loss methodology and CECL. Moreover, the new accounting standard is likely, as a result of its requirement to estimate and recognize expected credit losses on new assets, to introduce greater volatility in our provision for credit loans and allowance for loan losses. The Company is currently evaluating the magnitude of the one-time cumulative adjustment to its allowance and of the ongoing impact of the CECL model on its loan loss allowance and results of operations.\nBecause a significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans, negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity could impair the value of collateral securing our real estate loans and result in loan and other losses.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 75.30% of our loan portfolio was comprised of loans with real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. This includes collateral consisting of income producing and residential construction properties, which properties tend to be more sensitive to general economic conditions and downturns in real estate markets. As a result, adverse developments affecting real estate values in our market areas could increase the credit risk associated with our real estate loan portfolio. The market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of market conditions in the area in which the real estate is located. Adverse changes affecting real estate values and the liquidity of real estate in one or more of our markets could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio, and could result in losses that would adversely affect credit quality, financial condition, and results of operation. Negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity in our market areas could significantly impair the value of property pledged as collateral on loans and affect our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional losses. Collateral may have to be sold for less than the outstanding balance of the loan, which could result in losses on such loans. Such declines and losses could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and growth prospects. If real estate values decline, it is also more likely that we would be required to increase our ALLL, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be materially and adversely affected by the creditworthiness and liquidity of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks and other institutional customers. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by, or questions or concerns about the creditworthiness of, a counterparty or client, or concerns about the financial services industry generally. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to us. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on us.\n25\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe may not be able to meet our unfunded credit commitments, or adequately reserve for losses associated with our unfunded credit commitments.\nA commitment to extend credit is a formal agreement to lend funds to a client as long as there is no violation of any condition established under the agreement. The actual borrowing needs of our customers under these credit commitments have historically been lower than the contractual amount of the commitments. A significant portion of these commitments expire without being drawn upon. Because of the credit profile of our customers, we typically have a substantial amount of total unfunded credit commitments, which is not reflected on our balance sheet. Actual borrowing needs of our customers may exceed our expected funding requirements, especially during a challenging economic environment when our client companies may be more dependent on our credit commitments due to the lack of available credit elsewhere, the increasing costs of credit, or the limited availability of financings from other sources. Any failure to meet our unfunded credit commitments in accordance with the actual borrowing needs of our customers may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.\nChanges in interest rates could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur earnings and financial condition are dependent to a large degree upon net interest income, which is the difference, or spread, between interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets and interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. When market rates of interest change, the interest we receive on our assets and the interest we pay on our liabilities may fluctuate. This may cause decreases in our spread and may adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors including, without limitation: the rate of inflation; economic conditions; federal monetary policies; and stability of domestic and foreign markets.\nAlthough we have implemented procedures we believe will reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our net interest income, these procedures may not always be successful. Accordingly, changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest income and our net interest margin, asset quality, loan and lease origination volume, liquidity or overall profitability.\nIf we are unable to grow our noninterest income, our growth prospects will be impaired.\nTaking advantage of opportunities to develop new, and expand existing, streams of noninterest income, including service charges, loan servicing fees and income from the Bank\u2019s unconsolidated subsidiaries, is a part of our long-term growth strategy. If we are unsuccessful in our attempts to grow our noninterest income, our long-term growth will be impaired. Furthermore, focusing on these noninterest income streams may divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from our core banking business, which could impair our core business, financial condition and operating results.\n26\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur future success is largely dependent upon our ability to successfully execute our business strategy.\nOur future success, including our ability to achieve our growth and profitability goals, is dependent on the ability of our management team to execute on our long-term business strategy, which requires them to, among other things:\nmaintain and enhance our reputation; attract and retain experienced and talented bankers in each of our markets; maintain adequate funding sources, including by continuing to attract stable, low-cost deposits;enhance our market penetration in our metropolitan markets and maintain our leadership position in our community markets; improve our operating efficiency; implement new technologies to enhance the client experience and keep pace with our competitors; identify attractive acquisition targets, close on such acquisitions on favorable terms and successfully integrate acquired businesses; attract and maintain commercial banking relationships with well-qualified businesses, real estate developers and investors with proven track records in our market areas; attract sufficient loans that meet prudent credit standards; originate conforming residential mortgage loans for resale into secondary market to provide mortgage banking income; maintain adequate liquidity and regulatory capital and comply with applicable federal and state banking regulations; manage our credit, interest rate and liquidity risks; develop new, and grow our existing, streams of noninterest income; oversee the performance of third-party service providers that provide material services to our business; and control expenses in line with current projections.\nFailure to achieve these strategic goals could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategies and could negatively impact our business, growth prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Further, if we do not manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be negatively affected, and we may not be able to continue to implement our business strategy and successfully conduct our operations.\nWe follow a relationship-based operating model and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business.\nWe are a community bank, and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining bankers and other associates who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our clients and caring about our clients and associates. Furthermore, maintaining our reputation also depends on our ability to protect our brand name and associated intellectual property. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our associates or otherwise, our business and operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nWe depend on our executive officers and other key individuals to continue the implementation of our long-term business strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services and our inability to make up for such loss with qualified replacements.\nWe believe that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part on the skills of our management team and our ability to motivate and retain these individuals and other key individuals. The loss of any of their service could reduce our ability to successfully implement our long-term business strategy, our business could suffer and the value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected.\n27\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe success of our operating model depends on our ability to attract and retain talented bankers and associates in each of our markets.\nWe strive to attract and retain these bankers in each of our markets by fostering an entrepreneurial environment, empowering them with local decision making authority and providing them with sufficient infrastructure and resources to support their growth while also providing management with appropriate oversight. However, the competition for bankers in each of our markets is intense. We compete for talent with both smaller banks that may be able to offer bankers with more responsibility and autonomy and larger banks that may be able to offer bankers with higher compensation, resources and support. As a result, we may not be able to effectively compete for talent across our markets. Further, our bankers may leave us to work for our competitors and, in some instances, may take important banking and lending relationships with them to our competitors. If we are unable to attract and retain talented bankers in our markets, our business, growth prospects and financial results could be materially and adversely affected.\nAcquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute stockholder value, and integrating acquired companies may be more difficult, costly, or time-consuming than we expect.\nOur pursuit of acquisitions may disrupt our business, and any equity that we issue as merger consideration may have the effect of diluting the value of your investment. In addition, we may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of completed acquisitions. We anticipate that the integration of businesses that we may acquire in the future will be a time-consuming and expensive process, even if the integration process is effectively planned and implemented.\nIn addition, our acquisition activities could be material to our business and involve a number of significant risks, including the following:\nincurring time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and negotiating potential transactions, resulting in our attention being diverted from the operating of our existing business; using inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit, operations, management, and market risks with respect to the target company or the assets and liabilities that we seek to acquire; exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company; intense competition from other banking organizations and other potential acquirers, many of which have substantially greater resources than we do; potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of banks and businesses we acquire, including, without limitation, liabilities for regulatory and compliance issues; inability to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and other projected benefits of the acquisition; incurring time and expense required to integrate the operations and personnel of the combined businesses; inconsistencies in standards, procedures, and policies that would adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees; experiencing higher operating expenses relative to operating income from the new operations; creating an adverse short-term effect on our results of operations; losing key employees and customers; significant problems related to the conversion of the financial and customer data of the entity; integration of acquired customers into our financial and customer product systems; potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company; or risks of impairment to goodwill.\nIf difficulties arise with respect to the integration process, the economic benefits expected to result from acquisitions might not occur. As with any merger of financial institutions, there also may be business disruptions that cause us to lose customers or cause customers to move their business to other financial institutions. Failure to successfully integrate businesses that we acquire could have an adverse effect on our profitability, return on equity, return on assets, or our ability to implement our strategy, any of which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n28\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur funding sources may prove insufficient to replace deposits and support our future growth.\nDeposits, cash flows from operations (including from our mortgage business) and investment securities for sale are the primary sources of funds for our lending activities and general business purposes. However, from time to time we also obtain advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d), purchase federal funds, engage in overnight borrowing from the Federal Reserve and correspondent banks and sell loans\n. \nWhile we believe our current funding sources to be adequate, our future growth may be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing is not available on acceptable terms to accommodate future growth, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nDecreased residential mortgage origination, volume and pricing decisions of competitors may adversely affect our profitability.\nOur mortgage operation originates and sells residential mortgage loans and services residential mortgage loans. Changes in interest rates, housing prices, regulations by the applicable governmental authorities and pricing decisions by our loan competitors may adversely affect demand for our residential mortgage loan products, the revenue realized on the sale of loans, revenues received from servicing such loans for others, and ultimately reduce our net income. New regulations, increased regulatory reviews, and/or changes in the structure of the secondary mortgage markets which we would utilize to sell mortgage loans may be introduced and may increase costs and make it more difficult to operate a residential mortgage origination business.\nSystem failure or breaches of our network security, or the security of our data processing subsidiary, including as a result of cyberattacks or data security breaches, could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities.\nThe computer systems and network infrastructure we use may be vulnerable to physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event, as well as security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Any damage or failure that causes breakdowns or disruptions in our client relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of client business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nComputer break-ins, phishing and other disruptions could also jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure. Information security risks have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties. Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks. Although we believe we have robust information security procedures and controls, our technologies, systems, networks, and our clients\u2019 devices may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our clients\u2019 confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt our or our clients\u2019 business operations. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. In addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance with those requirements could also result in additional costs.\nWe are under continuous threat of loss due to hacking and cyberattacks especially as we continue to expand client capabilities to utilize internet and other remote channels to transact business. While we are not aware of any successful hacking or cyberattacks into our computer or other information technology systems, or those of our data processing subsidiary, there can be no assurance that we will not be the victim of successful hacking or cyberattacks in the future that could cause us to suffer material losses. The occurrence of any cyberattack or information security breach could result in potential liability to clients, reputational damage and the disruption of our operations, and regulatory concerns, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n29\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes and we may not have the resources to implement new technology to stay current with these changes.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. These trends were accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing demand for mobile banking solutions. In addition to better serving clients, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands for convenience as well as to provide secure electronic environments and create additional efficiencies in our operations as we continue to grow and expand our market area. Many of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements and have invested significantly more than us in technological improvements. As a result, they may be able to offer additional or more convenient products compared to those that we will be able to provide, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage. Accordingly, we may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing such products and services to our clients, which could impair our growth and profitability.\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, client or employee fraud and data processing system failures and errors.\nEmployee errors and employee and client misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our clients or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence. We maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against operational risks. If our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we rely heavily upon information supplied by third parties, including the information contained in credit applications, property appraisals, title information, equipment pricing and valuation and employment and income documentation, in deciding which loans we will originate, as well as the terms of those loans. If any of the information upon which we rely is misrepresented, either fraudulently or inadvertently, and the misrepresentation is not detected prior to asset funding, the value of the asset may be significantly lower than expected, or we may fund a loan that we would not have funded or on terms we would not have extended.\nWe depend on a number of third-party service providers and our operations could be interrupted if these third-party service providers experience difficulty, terminate their services or fail to comply with banking regulations.\nWe depend on a number of relationships with third-party service providers. Specifically, we receive core systems processing, essential web hosting and other Internet systems, deposit processing and other processing services from third-party service providers. If these third-party service providers experience difficulties, or terminate their services, and we are unable to replace them with other service providers, particularly on a timely basis, our operations could be interrupted. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, perhaps materially. Even if we are able to replace third-party service providers, it may be at a higher cost to us, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n30\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future.\nWe are required to meet certain regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity. We may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs, which could include the possibility of financing acquisitions. Our ability to raise additional capital depends on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry, market conditions and governmental activities, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we may be unable to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. Further, such additional capital could result in dilution to our existing shareholders. If we or the Bank fail to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as our ability to maintain compliance with regulatory capital requirements, would be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges in accounting standards could materially impact our financial statements.\nFrom time to time, FASB or the SEC may change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. Such changes may result in us being subject to new or changing accounting and reporting standards. In addition, the bodies that interpret the accounting standards (such as banking regulators or outside auditors) may change their interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. These changes may be beyond our control, can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, or apply an existing standard differently, also retrospectively, in each case resulting in our needing to revise or restate prior period financial statements.\nRisks related to our common stock\nApplicable laws and regulations restrict both the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company and the ability of the Company to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nBoth the Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends. In addition, the Federal Reserve has the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business. These federal and state laws, regulations and policies are described in greater detail in \u201cBusiness\u2014 Supervision and Regulation\u2014Payment of Dividends,\u201d but generally look to factors such as previous results and net income, capital needs, asset quality, existence of enforcement or remediation proceedings, and overall financial condition.\nFor the foreseeable future, the majority, if not all, of the Company\u2019s revenue will be from any dividends paid to the Company by the Bank. Accordingly, our ability to pay dividends also depends on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us. Furthermore, the present and future dividend policy of the Bank is subject to the discretion of its board of directors.\nWe cannot guarantee that the Company or the Bank will be permitted by financial condition or applicable regulatory restrictions to pay dividends, that the board of directors of the Bank will elect to pay dividends to us, nor can we guarantee the timing or amount of any dividend actually paid.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition, if the market for stocks in our industry, or the stock market in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n31\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFuture sales of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock may dilute our shareholders\u2019 ownership in us and may adversely affect us or the market price of our common stock.\nWe are generally not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock up to the authorized number of shares set forth in our charter. We may issue additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock in the future pursuant to current or future employee stock option plans, employee stock grants, upon exercise of warrants or in connection with future acquisitions or financings. We cannot predict the size of any such future issuances or the effect, if any, that any such future issuances will have on the trading price of our common stock. Any such future issuances of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock may have a dilutive effect on the holders of our common stock and could have a material negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our share price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities may dilute our shareholders ownership in us and may adversely affect us or the market price of our common stock.\nWe may sell additional shares of our common stock in public offerings, and issue additional shares of common stock or convertible securities to finance future acquisitions. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares that may be issued in connection with acquisitions), or the perception that such issuance could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nThe accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures could be affected if the judgments, assumptions or estimates used in our critical accounting policies are inaccurate.\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosure in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our critical accounting policies, which are included in the section captioned \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d, describe those significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that we consider \u201ccritical\u201d because they require judgments, assumptions and estimates that materially affect our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. As a result, if future events differ significantly from the judgments, assumptions and estimates in our critical accounting policies, those events or assumptions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nWe are an emerging growth company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various regulatory and reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, exemptions from being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, even if we comply with the greater obligations of public companies that are not emerging growth companies, we may avail ourselves of the reduced requirements applicable to emerging growth companies from time to time in the future, so long as we are an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, though we will cease to be an emerging growth company earlier if we have more than $1 billion in annual gross revenues, have more than $700 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt in a three-year period. Investors and securities analysts may find it more difficult to evaluate our common stock because we will rely on one or more of these exemptions and, as a result, investor confidence or the market price of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected.\n32\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur securities are not FDIC insured.\nSecurities that we issue, including our common stock, are not savings or deposit accounts or other obligations of any bank, insured by the FDIC, any other governmental agency or instrumentality, or any private insurer, and are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of our shareholders\u2019 investments.\nRisks related to the business environment and our industry\nInflation could negatively impact our business, our profitability and our stock price\n.\nProlonged periods of inflation may impact our profitability by negatively impacting our fixed costs and expenses, including increasing funding costs and expense related to talent acquisition and retention, and negatively impacting the demand for our products and services. Additionally, inflation may lead to a decrease in consumer and clients purchasing power and negatively affect the need or demand for our products and services. If significant inflation continues, our business could be negatively affected by, among other things, increased default rates leading to credit losses which could decrease our appetite for new credit extensions. These inflationary pressures could result in missed earnings and budgetary projections causing our stock price to suffer.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and will likely continue to adversely impact, our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations\n.\nThe extent and duration to which the continuing COVID-19 pandemic will impact our business in the future is unknown and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and outside our control. These developments include the duration and severity of the pandemic (including the possibility of further surges of new or existing COVID-19 variants of concern), supply chain disruptions, decreased demand for our products and services or those of our borrowers, which could increase our credit risk, rising inflation, our ability to maintain sufficient qualified personnel due to labor shortages, talent attrition, employee illness, quarantine, willingness to return to work, face-coverings and other safety requirements, or travel and other restrictions, and the actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals to contain the impact of COVID-19, as well as further actions taken by governmental authorities to limit the resulting economic impact. It is also possible that the pandemic and its aftermath will lead to a prolonged economic slowdown in sectors disproportionately affected by the pandemic or recession in the U.S. economy or the world economy in general.\nESG risks could adversely affect our reputation and shareholder, employee, client and third party relationships and may negatively affect our stock price\n.\nOur business faces increasing public scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) activities. We risk damage to our brand and reputation if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas, such as diversity, equity, inclusion, environmental stewardship, human capital management, support for our local communities, corporate governance and transparency, or fail to consider ESG factors in our business operations.\nFurthermore, as a result of our diverse base of clients and business partners, we may face potential negative publicity based on the identity of our clients or business partners and the public\u2019s (or certain segments of the public\u2019s) view of those entities. Such publicity may arise from traditional media sources or from social media and may increase rapidly in size and scope. If our client or business partner relationships were to become intertwined in such negative publicity, our ability to attract and retain clients, business partners, and employees may be negatively impacted, and our stock price may also be negatively impacted. Additionally, we may face pressure to not do business in certain industries that are viewed as harmful to the environment or are otherwise negatively perceived, which could impact our growth.Additionally, investors and shareholder advocates are placing ever increasing emphasis on how corporations address ESG issues in their business strategy when making investment decisions and when developing their investment theses and proxy recommendations. We may incur meaningful costs with respect to our ESG efforts and if such efforts are negatively perceived, our reputation and stock price may suffer.\n33\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe Company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision, which may interfere with our ability to conduct our business and may negatively impact our financial results\n.\nThe Company, primarily through the Bank and certain non-bank subsidiaries, are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds and the safety and soundness of the banking system as a whole, and not shareholders. These regulations affect the Bank\u2019s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect the Company and/or the Bank in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject the Company and/or the Bank to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products the Company and/or the Bank may offer, and/or limit the pricing the Company and/or the Bank may charge on certain banking services, among other things. Compliance personnel and resources may increase our costs of operations and adversely impact our earnings.\nFailure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur. See \u201cBusiness - Supervision and Regulation\u201d.\nFederal regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve and the OCC, periodically conduct examinations of our business, including for compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with any supervisory actions to which we are or become subject as a result of such examinations may adversely affect our business.\nFederal regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve and the OCC, periodically conduct examinations of our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, an agency were to determine that the financial, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or violates any law or regulation, such agency may take certain remedial or enforcement actions it deems appropriate to correct any deficiency. Remedial or enforcement actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced against a bank, to direct an increase in the bank\u2019s capital, to restrict the bank\u2019s growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against a bank\u2019s officers or directors, and to remove officers and directors. The CFPB also has authority to take enforcement actions, including cease-and-desist orders or civil monetary penalties, if it finds that we offer consumer financial products and services in violation of federal consumer financial protection laws.\nIf we were unable to comply with future regulatory directives, or if we were unable to comply with the terms of any future supervisory requirements to which we may become subject, then we could become subject to a variety of supervisory actions and orders, including cease-and-desist orders, prompt corrective actions, memoranda of understanding and other regulatory enforcement actions. Such supervisory actions could, among other things, impose greater restrictions on our business, as well as our ability to develop any new business. We could also be required to raise additional capital, dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed time period, or both. Failure to implement remedial measures as required by financial regulatory agencies could result in additional orders or penalties from federal and state regulators, which could trigger one or more of the remedial actions described above. The terms of any supervisory action and associated consequences with any failure to comply with any supervisory action could have a material negative effect on our business, operating flexibility and overall financial condition.\n34\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe have a concentration in commercial real estate lending which could cause our regulators to restrict our ability to grow.\nAs a part of their regulatory oversight, the federal regulators have issued the Commercial Real Estate (\u201cCRE\u201d) Concentration Guidance on sound risk management practices with respect to a financial institution\u2019s concentrations in commercial real estate lending activities. These guidelines were issued in response to the agencies\u2019 concerns that rising CRE concentrations might expose financial institutions to unanticipated earnings and capital volatility in the event of adverse changes in the commercial real estate market. Existing guidance reinforces and enhances existing regulations and guidelines for safe and sound real estate lending by providing supervisory criteria, including numerical indicators to assist in identifying institutions with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny. The guidance does not limit a banks\u2019 commercial real estate lending, but rather guides institutions in developing risk management practices and levels of capital that are commensurate with the level and nature of their commercial real estate concentrations. The CRE Concentration Guidance identifies certain concentration levels that, if exceeded, will expose the institution to additional supervisory analysis with regard to the institution\u2019s CRE concentration risk. The CRE Concentration Guidance is designed to promote appropriate levels of capital and sound loan and risk management practices for financial institutions with a concentration of CRE loans. In general, the CRE Concentration Guidance establishes the following supervisory criteria as preliminary indications of possible CRE concentration risk: (1) the institution\u2019s total construction, land development and other land loans represent 100% or more of total risk-based capital; or (2) total non-owner occupied CRE loans as defined in the regulatory guidelines represent 300% or more of total risk-based capital, and the institution\u2019s CRE loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the prior 36-month period. Pursuant to the CRE Concentration Guidelines, loans secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate are not included for purposes of CRE Concentration calculation. Although we are actively working to manage our CRE concentration and believe that our underwriting policies, management information systems, independent credit administration process, and monitoring of real estate loan concentrations are currently sufficient to address the CRE Concentration Guidance, the OCC or other federal regulators could become concerned about our CRE loan concentrations, and they could limit our ability to grow by, among other things, restricting their approvals for the establishment or acquisition of branches, or approvals of mergers or other acquisition opportunities.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. The monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted.\nThe Federal Reserve may require us to commit capital resources to support the Bank.\nThe Federal Reserve, which examines us and the Bank, requires a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. Under the \u201csource of strength\u201d doctrine, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act directs the federal bank regulators to require that all companies that directly or indirectly control an insured depository institution serve as a source of strength for the institution. Under these requirements, in the future, we could be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank if it experiences financial distress.\n35\n\n\nTable of Contents\nA capital injection may be required at times when we do not have the resources to provide it, and therefore we may be required to borrow the funds. In the event of a bank holding company\u2019s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the holding company\u2019s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations. Thus, any borrowing that must be done by the holding company in order to make the required capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and will adversely impact the holding company\u2019s cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe Company may be subject to more stringent capital requirements.\nThe Bank is subject to capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital which the Bank must maintain. From time to time, the regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. If the Bank fails to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, our financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. We may also be required to satisfy additional capital adequacy standards as determined by the Federal Reserve. These requirements, and any other new regulations, could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends, or could require us to reduce business levels or to raise capital, including in ways that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur deposit insurance premiums could be substantially higher in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our future earnings.\nThe FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, up to applicable limits. The amount of a particular institution\u2019s deposit insurance assessment is based on that institution\u2019s risk classification under an FDIC risk-based assessment system. An institution\u2019s risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to its regulators. We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. Any future additional assessments, increases or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums could reduce our profitability, may limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities or otherwise negatively impact our operations.\nWe are subject to federal and state fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\nFederal and state fair lending laws and regulations, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Department of Justice, CFPB and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. A successful challenge to our performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could adversely impact our rating under the Community Reinvestment Act and result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on merger and acquisition activity and restrictions on expansion activity, which could negatively impact our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\n36\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe could face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, the USA PATRIOT Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. FinCEN, established by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and engages in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and IRS. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by OFAC related to U.S. sanctions regimes. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we have already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.

Historical results of operations and the percentage relationships among any amounts included, and any trends that may appear, may not indicate trends in operations or results of operations for any future periods. We are a bank holding company and we conduct all of our material business operations through the Bank. As a result, the discussion and analysis above relates to activities primarily conducted at the Bank level.\nWe have made, and will continue to make, various forward-looking statements with respect to financial and business matters. Comments regarding our business that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements. For additional information regarding our cautionary disclosures, see the \u00a0\u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this Annual Report.\nOVERVIEW\nBank First Corporation is a Wisconsin corporation that was organized primarily to serve as the holding company for Bank First, N.A. Bank First, N.A., which was incorporated in 1894, is a nationally-chartered bank headquartered in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. It is a member of the Federal Reserve, and is regulated by the OCC. Including its headquarters in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, the Bank has 21 banking locations in Manitowoc, Outagamie, Brown, Winnebago, Sheboygan, Waupaca, Ozaukee, Monroe, and Jefferson counties in Wisconsin. The Bank offers loan, deposit and treasury management products at each of its banking locations.\nAs with most community banks, the Bank derives a significant portion of its income from interest received on loans and investments. The Bank\u2019s primary source of funding is deposits, both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing. In order to maximize the Bank\u2019s net interest income, or the difference between the income on interest-earning assets and the expense of interest-bearing liabilities, the Bank must not only manage the volume of these balance sheet items, but also the yields earned on interest-earning assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. To account for credit risk inherent in all loans, the Bank maintains an ALLL to absorb possible losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible. The Bank establishes and maintains this allowance by charging a provision for loan losses against operating earnings. Beyond its net interest income, the Bank further receives income through the net gain on sale of loans held for sale as well as servicing income which is retained on those sold loans. In order to maintain its operations and bank locations, the Bank incurs various operating expenses which are further described within the \u201cResults of Operations\u201d later in this section.\nThe Bank is a 49.8% member of a data processing subsidiary, UFS, LLC, which provides core data processing, endpoint management cloud services, cyber security and digital banking solutions for over 60 Midwest banks. The Bank, through its 100% owned subsidiary TVG Holdings, Inc., also holds a 40% ownership interest in Ansay & Associates, LLC, an insurance agency providing clients primarily located in Wisconsin with insurance and risk management solutions. These unconsolidated subsidiary interests contribute noninterest income to the Bank through their underlying annual earnings.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had total consolidated assets of $2.94 billion, total loans of $2.24 billion, total deposits of $2.53 billion and total stockholders\u2019 equity of $322.7 million. The Company employs approximately 287 full-time equivalent employees and has an assets-to-FTE ratio of approximately $10.2 million. For more information, see the Company\u2019s website at www.bankfirst.com.\n41\n\n\nTable of Contents\nRecent acquisitions\nPartnership Community Bancshares, Inc\n.\nOn July 12, 2019, the Company completed a merger with Partnership, a bank holding company headquartered in Cedarburg, Wisconsin, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Bank Merger, dated as of January 22, 2019 and as amended on April 30, 2019, by and among the Company and Partnership, whereby Partnership merged with and into the Company, and Partnership Bank, Partnership\u2019s wholly-owned banking subsidiary, merged with and into the Bank. Partnership\u2019s principal activity was the ownership and operation of Partnership Bank, a state-chartered banking institution that operated four (4) branches in Wisconsin at the time of closing. The merger consideration totaled approximately $49.6 million.\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Partnership shareholders had the option to receive either 0.34879 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock or $17.3001 in cash for each outstanding share of Partnership common stock, and cash in lieu of any remaining fractional share. The stock versus cash elections by the Partnership shareholders were subject to final consideration being made up of approximately $14.3 million in cash and 534,659 shares of Company common stock, valued at approximately $35.3 million (based on a value of $66.03 per share on the closing date).\nTimberwood Bancshares, Inc\n.\nOn May 15, 2020, the Company completed a merger with Timberwood, a bank holding company headquartered in Tomah, WI, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Bank Merger, dated as of November 20, 2019, by and among the Company and Timberwood, whereby Timberwood was merged with and into the Company, and Timberwood Bank, Timberwood's wholly owned banking subsidiary, was merged with and into the Bank. Timberwood's principal activity was the ownership and operation of Timberwood Bank, a state-chartered banking institution that operated one (1) branch in Wisconsin at the time of closing. The merger consideration totaled approximately $29.8 million.\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Timberwood shareholders received 5.1445 shares of the Company's common stock for each outstanding share of Timberwood common stock, and cash in lieu of any remaining fractional share. Company stock issued totaled 575,641 shares valued at approximately $29.4 million, with cash of $0.4 million comprising the remainder of merger consideration.\nDenmark Bancshares, Inc.\nOn January 18, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Denmark Bancshares, Inc. (\u201cDenmark\u201d), a Wisconsin Corporation, pursuant to which Denmark will merge with and into the Company and Denmark\u2019s banking subsidiary, Denmark State Bank, will merge with and into the Bank. The transaction is expected to close during the third quarter of 2022 and is subject to, among other items, approval by the shareholders of both institutions and regulatory agencies. Merger consideration will consist of up to 20% cash and no less than 80% of the common stock of the Company, and will total approximately $119 million, subject to the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of closing. Based on results as of December 31, 2021, the combined company would have total assets of approximately $3.6 billion, loans of approximately $2.7 billion, and deposits of approximately $3.1 billion.\nThe Company accounts for these transactions under the acquisition method of accounting, and thus, the financial position and results of operations of acquired institutions prior to the consummation date are not included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The acquisition method of accounting required assets purchased and liabilities assumed to be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The Company determines the fair value of core deposit intangibles, securities, premises and equipment, loans, other assets and liabilities, deposits and borrowings with the assistance of third party valuations, appraisals, and third party advisors. The estimated fair values are subject to refinement for up to one year after the consummation as additional information becomes available relative to the closing date fair values.\n42\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCOVID-19 and Recent Events\nThe U.S. economy contracted in the first half of 2020, ending the longest expansionary period in U.S. history, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During March 2020, in an effort to lessen the impact of COVID-19 on consumers and businesses, the Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate 1.5 percentage points to 0.00 to 0.25 percent and the U.S. government enacted the CARES Act, the largest economic stimulus package in the nation\u2019s history. The Company responded to the pandemic, beginning in March 2020, by supporting our clients, employees, and communities with such measures as remote work capabilities and branch service enhancements, loan payment deferrals, and accelerated investments in several technology initiatives that provided more convenience and a better digital experience as clients adapted to this highly virtual environment. The Company participated in the PPP and funded approximately 2,998 loans totaling approximately $377.5 million under the programs available in both 2020 and 2021.\nAdditional government spending measures and the availability of vaccines improved consumer confidence and demand, and the economy largely reopened in 2021, leading to a reduction in the unemployment rate and accelerated GDP growth. While 2021 has seen a recovery in the U.S. economy compared to 2020, uncertainty and market disruptions such as additional coronavirus variants, pandemic-related supply chain issues and labor shortages persist. The economic expansion has been met with inflationary pressures that are expected to result in the Federal Open Market Committee policy-tightening in 2022, likely including multiple interest rate hikes. With a strong asset-sensitive balance sheet and our strong position in our markets, we expect increases in loan demand and interest rates should improve returns going forward.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to GAAP in the United States and general practices within the financial institution industry. Significant accounting and reporting policies are summarized below.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805). We recognize the full fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and immediately expense transaction costs. There is no separate recognition of the acquired ALLL on the acquirer\u2019s balance sheet as credit related factors are incorporated directly into the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. If the amount of consideration exceeds the fair value of assets purchased less the fair value of liabilities assumed, goodwill is recorded. Alternatively, if the amount by which the fair value of assets purchased exceeds the fair value of liabilities assumed and consideration paid, a gain (bargain purchase gain) is recorded. Fair values are subject to refinement for up to one year after the closing date of an acquisition as information relative to closing date fair values becomes available. Results of operations of the acquired business are included in the statement of income from the effective date of the acquisition.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\u2009\u2014\u2009Originated\nThe ALLL is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense as losses are estimated to have occurred. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.\nManagement regularly evaluates the ALLL using general economic conditions, our past loan loss experience, composition of the portfolio, credit worthiness of the borrowers, the estimated value of the underlying collateral, the assumptions about cash flow, determination of loss factors for estimating credit losses and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective since it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change.\n43\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe ALLL consists of specific reserves for certain impaired loans and general reserves for non-impaired loans. Specific reserves reflect estimated losses on impaired loans from management\u2019s analyses developed through specific credit allocations. The specific credit reserves are based on regular analyses of impaired non-homogenous loans. These analyses involve a high degree of judgment in estimating the amount of loss associated with specific loans, including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values. The general reserve is based on our historical loss experience which is updated quarterly. The general reserve portion of the ALLL also includes consideration of certain qualitative factors such as (1) changes in lending policies and/or underwriting practices, (2) national and local economic conditions, (3) changes in portfolio volume and nature, (4) experience, ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff, (5) levels of and trends in past-due and nonaccrual loans and quality, (6) changes in loan review and oversight, (7) impact and effects of concentrations and (8) other issues deemed relevant.\nManagement believes that the current ALLL is adequate. While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the ALLL. Such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\u2009\u2014\u2009Acquired\nThe ALLL for acquired loans is calculated using a methodology similar to that described for originated loans. Performing acquired loans are subsequently evaluated for any required allowance at each reporting date. Such required allowance for each loan pool is compared to the remaining fair value discount for that pool. If greater, the excess is recognized as an addition to the allowance through a provision for loan losses. If less than the discount, no additional allowance is recorded. Charge-offs and losses first reduce any remaining fair value discount for the loan pool and once the discount is depleted, losses are applied against the allowance established for that pool.\nFor purchase credit impaired loans after an acquisition, cash flows expected to be collected are recast for each loan periodically as determined appropriate by management. If the present value of expected cash flows for a loan is less than its carrying value, impairment is reflected by an increase in the ALLL and a charge to the provision for loan losses. If the present value of the expected cash flows for a loan is greater than its carrying value, any previously established ALLL is reversed and any remaining difference increases the accretable yield which will be taken into income over the remaining life of the loan. Loans which were considered TDRs by the acquired institution prior to the acquisition are not required to be classified as TDRs in our consolidated financial statements unless or until such loans would subsequently meet our criteria to be classified as such, since acquired loans were recorded at their estimated fair values at the time of the acquisition.\nImpaired Investment Securities\nUnrealized gains or losses considered temporary and the noncredit portion of unrealized losses deemed other-than-temporary are reported as an increase or decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income. \u00a0The credit-related portion of unrealized losses deemed other-than-temporary is recorded in current period earnings. Realized gains or losses, determined on the basis of the cost of specific securities sold, are included in earnings. We evaluate securities for other-than-temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. As part of such monitoring, the credit quality of individual securities and their issuers are assessed. In addition, management considers the length of time and extent that fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and that the Company does not have the intent to sell the security and it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis. Adjustments to market value that are considered temporary are recorded as a separate component of equity, net of tax. \u00a0If an impairment of security is identified as other-than-temporary based on information available such as the decline in the credit worthiness of the issuer, external market ratings or the anticipated or realized elimination of associated dividends, such impairments are further analyzed to determine if a credit loss exists. If there is a credit loss, it will be recorded in the consolidated statement of income in the period of identification.\n44\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill\nIntangible assets consist of the value of core deposits and mortgage servicing assets and the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets (\u201cgoodwill\u201d). The value of core deposits is stated at cost less accumulated amortization and is amortized on a sum of the years digits basis over a period of one to ten years.\nMortgage servicing rights are recognized as separate assets when rights are acquired through purchase or through sale of mortgage loans with servicing retained. Servicing rights acquired through sale of financial assets are recorded based on the fair value of the servicing right. The determination of fair value is based on a valuation model and includes stratifying the mortgage servicing rights by predominant characteristics, such as interest rates and terms, and estimating the fair value of each stratum based on the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The valuation model incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income, such as costs to service, a discount rate, and prepayment speeds. Changes in fair value are recorded as an adjustment to earnings.\nWe perform a \u201cqualitative\u201d assessment of goodwill to determine whether further impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets is necessary on at least an annual basis. If it is determined, as a result of performing a qualitative assessment over goodwill, that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, management will perform an impairment test to determine if the carrying value of goodwill is realizable.\nDeferred Tax Assets\nDeferred tax assets (\u201cDTA\u201d) and liabilities are determined using the liability method. DTAs and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and the current enacted tax rates which will be in effect when these differences are expected to reverse. Provision (benefit) for deferred taxes is the result of changes in the DTAs and liabilities. Deferred taxes are reviewed quarterly and would be reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon the information available, it is more likely than not that some or all of the DTAs will not be realized.\nRecent Accounting Developments\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, \nFinancial Instruments\u2009\u2014\u2009Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\n. Certain aspects of this ASU were updated in November 2018 by the issuance of ASU 2018-19, \nCodification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses\n. The main objective of the ASU is to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. To achieve this objective, the amendments in the ASU replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. During 2019 FASB issued ASU 2019-10 which delated the effective date of ASU 2016-13 for smaller, publicly traded companies, until interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022. This delay applies to the Company as it was classified as a \u201cSmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act as of the date ASU 2019-10 was enacted. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-13 on the consolidated financial statements, although the general expectation in the banking industry is that the implementation of this standard will result in higher required balances in the ALLL.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, \nReference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\n. This ASU provides optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. It provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The updated guidance is effective for all entities from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Corporation has been diligent in responding to reference rate reform and does not anticipate a significant impact to its financial statements as a result.\n45\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn October 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-08, \nCodification Improvements to Subtopic 310-20, Receivables \u2013 Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs.\n This ASU clarifies the requirements for entities to reevaluate whether a callable debt security is within the scope of paragraph 310-20-35-33 of the stated subtopic for each reporting period. The ASU was published to clarify the Codification and correct its unintended application and will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning within those fiscal years, beginning after December 31, 2020. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements as all premiums within our securities portfolio were already being amortized to the earliest call date prior to the implementation as required under subtopic 310-20.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nGeneral.\n \u00a0Net income increased $7.4 million, or 19.4%, to $45.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $38.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The primary reasons for the increase in profitability were increased net interest, a reduced provision for loan losses during 2021, robust retail mortgage lending which led to a large increase in gains on sales of mortgage loans to the secondary market, reduced losses on sales and valuations of OREO and a significant penalty for the early extinguishment of debt during 2020 that did not recur during 2021. This was offset by a small loss on sales of securities during 2021 that compared unfavorably to a gain of $3.2 million on these sales during 2020 as well as a $1.7 million gain on the sale of a branch location during 2020 with no similar gain during 2021.\nNet Interest Income. \u00a0\nThe management of interest income and expense is fundamental to our financial performance. Net interest income, the difference between interest income and interest expense, is the largest component of the Company\u2019s total revenue. Management closely monitors both total net interest income and the net interest margin (net interest income divided by average earning assets). We seek to maximize net interest income without exposing the Company to an excessive level of interest rate risk through our asset and liability policies. Interest rate risk is managed by monitoring the pricing, maturity and repricing options of all classes of interest-bearing assets and liabilities. Our net interest margin can also be adversely impacted by the reversal of interest on nonaccrual loans and the reinvestment of loan payoffs into lower yielding investment securities and other short-term investments.\nNet interest income after provision for loan losses increased by $7.3 million to $87.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $79.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest income on loans decreased by $1.9 million, or 1.9%, from 2020 to 2021. Total average interest-earning assets increased to $2.63 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $2.31 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Bank\u2019s net interest margin decreased 37 basis points to 3.47% for the year ended December 31, 2021, down from 3.84% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInterest Income. \u00a0\nTotal interest income decreased $2.3 million, or 2.30%, to $98.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, down from $100.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to yield on loans decreasing by 50 basis points from 4.75% during 2020 to 4.25% during 2021, which more than offset the $185.1 million increase in average balances of loans during 2021.\nInterest Expense.\n \u00a0Interest expense decreased $5.6 million, or 40.1%, to $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, down from $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was driven by declines in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, falling 39 basis points from 0.87% to 0.48%. This decline was primarily the result of a significantly lower interest rate environment that developed through the first half of 2020 and continued throughout 2021.\nInterest expense on interest-bearing deposits decreased by $4.9 million to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, from $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the aforementioned lower interest rate environment, allowing the Company to significantly reduce crediting interest rates on non-time, interest-bearing deposit accounts. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.45% for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 0.83% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n46\n\n\nTable of Contents\nProvision for Loan Losses. \u00a0\nCredit risk is inherent in the business of making loans. We establish an ALLL through charges to earnings, which are shown in the statements of operations as the provision for loan losses. Specifically identifiable and quantifiable known losses are promptly charged off against the allowance. The provision for loan losses is determined by conducting a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of our ALLL and charging the shortfall or excess, if any, to the current quarter\u2019s expense. This has the effect of creating variability in the amount and frequency of charges to earnings. The provision for loan losses and level of allowance for each period are dependent upon many factors, including loan growth, net charge-offs, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, delinquencies, management\u2019s assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio, the valuation of problem loans and the general economic conditions in our market area. The determination of the amount is complex and involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity.\nWe recorded a provision for loan losses of $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. \u00a0Provision expense was elevated during 2020 in response to uncertainty created by COVID-19 and society\u2019s response to it. Actual asset quality metrics during the course of 2021 remained strong, however, and allowed for a reduction in provision expense during that year. The ALLL was $20.3 million, or 0.91% of total loans, at December 31, 2021 compared to $17.7 million, or 0.81% of total loans at December 31, 2020. The increase in ALLL coverage to total loans from December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2021, was primarily due to a smaller percentage of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio accounted for under purchase accounting year-over-year. Under the Company\u2019s current allowance methodology, loans which are accounted for under purchase accounting do not require an ALLL reserve allocation.\nNoninterest Income. \u00a0\nNoninterest income is an important component of our total revenues. A significant portion of our noninterest income is associated with service charges and income from the Bank\u2019s unconsolidated subsidiaries, Ansay and UFS. Other sources of noninterest income include loan servicing fees and gains on sales of mortgage loans.\nNoninterest income was $23.5 million for 2021, matching non-interest income during 2020. Service charges increased by $1.1 million, or 22.5%, from 2020 to 2021, as a result of new markets and added scale from three acquisitions during the previous four years. Loan servicing income and net gain on sales of mortgage loans increased by $2.4 million and $2.1 million from 2020 to 2021, respectively, as a result of a robust residential mortgage lending environment during 2021 spurred by historically low mortgage interest rates. Due to uncertainty about liquidity needs in financial markets during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company sold approximately $34.0 million in U.S. Treasury Securities during the second quarter of 2020, resulting in a gain on sale of securities of $3.2 million. This compared favorably to small losses on sales of securities during 2021. Finally, the Company recorded a $1.7 million gain on the sale of a branch location during December 2020. There was no similar sale during 2021, causing other noninterest income to decrease year-over-year. The major components of our noninterest income are listed in the table below:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nFor the Years Ended\n\u200b\n\u200b\nDecember\u00a031,\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2021\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2020\n(In thousands)\n\u200b\n\u200b\nNoninterest Income\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\nService Charges\n\u200b\n$\n 6,128\n\u200b\n$\n 5,003\nIncome from Ansay & Associates, LLC\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 2,587\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 2,740\nIncome from UFS, LLC\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 2,556\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 3,066\nLoan Servicing income\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 3,839\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 1,420\nNet gain on sales of mortgage loans\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 7,371\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 5,310\nNet gain on sales of securities\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (3)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 3,233\nOther\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 1,040\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 2,748\nTotal noninterest income\n\u200b\n$\n 23,518\n\u200b\n$\n 23,520\n\u200b\n47\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNoninterest Expense. \u00a0\nNoninterest expense decreased $2.8 million to $50.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, down from $53.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Personnel expense increased $1.2 million, or 4.6%, primarily as a result of customary annual salary increases. Occupancy expense decreased $0.5 million, or 11.0%, data processing decreased $0.2 million, or 3.1%, and outside service fees decreased $1.0 million, or 25.2%, primarily as a \u00a0result of the Company completing an acquisition of another institution during 2020 with no corresponding acquisition during 2021. These areas of noninterest expense are typically elevated during years where acquisitions occur. The Company had sales of two large foreclosed properties scheduled to close late in the first quarter of 2020 which would have resulted in modest losses. Due to the economic turmoil that resulted during the last several weeks of the first quarter of 2020, terms of these sales were negatively impacted. Rather than hold these properties heading into this time of uncertainty, the Company chose to accept the reduced terms, causing significant losses on these sales that were the primary components of $1.4 million in total losses on sales and valuations of other real estate owned during 2020. During 2021 the Company experienced a small overall gain on these types of transactions, creating a very favorable year-over-year comparison. Finally, during the second quarter of 2020 the Company paid off $30.0 million in borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago which had contractual maturities ranging from August 2022 through August 2024, resulting in prepayment penalties of $1.3 million, but saving the Company $1.7 million in interest over the next four years. There was no similar action during 2021.

The primary reasons for the increase in profitability were increased net interest and service charge income from the added scale as a result of the acquisitions of Partnership and Timberwood, significant growth in our loan portfolio through participation in PPP, and robust retail mortgage lending which led to a large increase in gains on sales of mortgage loans to the secondary market. This was offset by larger provisions for loan losses during 2020, as well as increased expenses related to personnel, facilities and data processing as part of the same added scale from the aforementioned acquisitions. 2020 profitability was further negatively impacted by higher losses on sales of foreclosed properties and a penalty related to the early extinguishment of long-term debt.\n48\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNet Interest Income. \u00a0\nNet interest income after provision for loan losses increased by $15.3 million to $79.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $64.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest income on loans increased by $12.3 million, or 14.9%, from 2019 to 2020. Total average interest-earning assets increased to $2.31 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $1.81 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Bank\u2019s net interest margin decreased 11 basis points to 3.84% for the year ended December 31, 2020, down from 3.95% for the year ended December 31, 2019. \nInterest Income.\n \u00a0Total interest income increased $11.5 million, or 12.9%, to $100.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, up from $89.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. As noted, the increase was primarily due to loan growth from the acquisitions of Partnership and Timberwood, as well as participation in PPP. The average balance of loans increased by $466.9 million during 2020. \u00a0\nInterest Expense. \u00a0\nInterest expense decreased $5.6 million, or 28.9%, to $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, down from $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was driven by declines in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, falling 70 basis points from 1.57% to 0.87%. This decline was primarily the result of a significantly lower interest rate environment that developed through the first half of 2020. \nInterest expense on interest-bearing deposits decreased by $5.4 million to $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to the aforementioned lower interest rate environment, allowing the Company to significantly reduce crediting interest rates on non-time, interest-bearing deposit accounts. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.83% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 1.50% for the year ended December 31, 2019. \nProvision for Loan Losses. \u00a0\nWe recorded a provision for loan losses of $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. \u00a0Significant charge-offs occurring during the third quarter of 2019 necessitated increased provisions for loan losses during 2019. These charge-offs were the result of exiting certain relationships during that quarter which were originally acquired as part of the Waupaca transaction. Despite having significantly reduced charge-offs during 2020, economic uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic required a build-up of our ALLL, resulting in higher provision expense. The ALLL was $17.7 million, or 0.81% of total loans, at December 31, 2020 compared to $11.4 million, or 0.66% of total loans at December 31, 2019. \n49\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNoninterest Income.\n \u00a0Noninterest income increased $10.9 million to $23.5 million in 2020 compared to $12.6 million in 2019. Service charges increased by $1.5 million, or 42.7%, from 2019 to 2020, the result of new markets and added scale from three acquisitions in slightly more than three years. Income from Ansay increased by $0.9 million as a result of modestly higher profitability at that organization as well as the increase in our ownership during October 2019. Loan servicing income and net gain on sales of mortgage loans increased by $0.9 and $3.9 million from 2019 to 2020, the result of a robust residential mortgage lending environment during 2020 spurred by historically low mortgage interest rates. Due to uncertainty about liquidity needs in financial markets during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company sold approximately $34.0 million in U.S. Treasury Securities during the second quarter of 2020, resulting in a gain on sale of securities of $3.2 million, an increase of $2.6 million over 2019. Finally, the Company recorded a $1.7 million gain on the sale of a branch location during December 2020, causing other noninterest income to increase year-over-year.

Year-over-year, personnel expense increased $4.4 million, or 19.1%, occupancy expense increased $0.9 million, or 22.3%, data processing increased $1.0 million, or 22.3%, outside service fees increased $1.1 million, or 35.2%, and amortization of intangibles increased $0.6 million, or 53.0% the result of added scale and expenses from acquisitions of Partnership and Timberwood during 2019 and 2020. Postage, stationary, and supplies increased by $0.3 million, or 47.6%, from 2019 to 2020 as a result of costs associated with the Company\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company had sales of two large foreclosed properties scheduled to close late in the first quarter of 2020 which would have resulted in modest losses. Due to the economic turmoil that resulted during the last several weeks of that quarter, terms of these sales were negatively impacted. Rather than hold these properties heading into this time of uncertainty, the Company chose to accept the reduced terms, causing significant losses on these sales that were the primary components of $1.4 million in total losses on sales and valuations of other real estate owned, compared to gains of $0.1 million during 2019. Finally, during the second quarter of 2020 the Company paid off $30.0 million in borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago which had contractual maturities ranging from August 2022 through August 2024, resulting in prepayment penalties of $1.3 million, but saving the Company $1.7 million in interest over the next four years.

The effective tax rate for 2020 increased due to the fact that tax- exempt interest remained consistent year-over-year while other taxable components of income increased significantly.\nNET INTEREST MARGIN\nNet interest income represents the difference between interest earned, primarily on loans and investments, and interest paid on funding sources, primarily deposits and borrowings. Interest rate spread is the difference between the average rate earned on total interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is the amount of net interest income, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. The average rate earned on earning assets is the amount of annualized taxable equivalent interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities is equal to annualized interest expense as a percentage of average interest-bearing liabilities. \n51\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables

The Bank makes commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, construction and development loans, residential real estate loans, and a variety of consumer loans and other loans. Much of the loans made by the Bank are secured by real estate collateral. The Bank\u2019s commercial business loans are primarily made based on the cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower, with liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral typically being viewed as the primary source of repayment in the event of borrower default. Although commercial business loans are also often collateralized by equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, or other business assets, the liquidation of collateral in the event of default is often an insufficient source of repayment. Repayment of the Bank\u2019s residential loans are generally dependent on the health of the employment market in the borrowers\u2019 geographic areas and that of the general economy with liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral being typically viewed as the primary source of repayment in the event of borrower default.\nOur loan portfolio is our most significant earning asset, comprising 76.1%, 80.6% and 78.6% of our total assets as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our strategy is to grow our loan portfolio by originating quality commercial and consumer loans that comply with our credit policies and that produce revenues consistent with our financial objectives. We believe our loan portfolio is well-balanced, which provides us with the opportunity to grow while monitoring our loan concentrations.\nTotal loans increased $44.1 million, or 2.0%, to $2.24 billion as of December 31, 2021 as compared to $2.19 billion as of December 31, 2020. Our loan growth during the year ended December 31, 2021 has been comprised of an decrease of $78.8 million or 17.7% in commercial and industrial loans, an increase of $119.2 million or 12.0% in commercial real estate loans, a decrease of $7.6 million or 5.4% in construction and development loans, an increase of $26.0 million or 4.8% in residential 1-4 family loans and a decrease of $14.7 million or 21.6% in consumer and other loans.\nTotal loans increased $455.1 million, or 26.2%, to $2.19 billion as of December 31, 2020 as compared to $1.74 billion as of December 31, 2019. Our loan growth during the year ended December 31, 2020 has been comprised of an increase of $142.6 million or 47.2% in commercial and industrial loans, an increase of $179.1 million or 22.0% in commercial real estate loans, an increase of $7.9 million or 6.0% in construction and development loans, an increase of $97.2 million or 21.7% in residential 1-4 family loans and an increase of $28.3 million or 70.7% in consumer and other loans. The significant increase in loans during the year ended December 31, 2020 is attributable to loans purchased as part of the Timberwood transaction along with significant commercial and industrial loan growth as a result of participating in the PPP loan program.\n56\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the balance and associated percentage of each major category in our loan portfolio at December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDecember\u00a031,\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n%\u00a0of\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n%\u00a0of\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n%\u00a0of\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n2021\n\u200b\nTotal\n\u200b\n2020\n\u200b\nTotal\n\u200b\n2019\n\u200b\nTotal\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nCommercial & industrial\n\u200b\n$\n 366,166\n\u200b\n 16\n%\n$\n 444,992\n\u200b\n 20\n%\n$\n 302,380\n\u200b\n 17\n%\u00a0\u00a0\nCommercial real estate\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nOwner Occupied\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 574,565\n\u200b\n 26\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n 549,253\n\u200b\n 25\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n 459,482\n\u200b\n 26\n%\u00a0\u00a0\nNon-owner occupied\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 536,892\n\u200b\n 24\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n 442,996\n\u200b\n 20\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n 353,661\n\u200b\n 20\n%\u00a0\u00a0\nConstruction & Development\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 132,454\n\u200b\n 6\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n 140,074\n\u200b\n 6\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n 132,163\n\u200b\n 8\n%\u00a0\u00a0\nResidential 1-4 family\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 571,845\n\u200b\n 26\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n 545,806\n\u200b\n 25\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n 448,630\n\u200b\n 26\n%\u00a0\u00a0\nConsumer\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 32,131\n\u200b\n 1\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n 30,488\n\u200b\n 1\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n 29,586\n\u200b\n 2\n%\u00a0\u00a0\nOther Loans\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 21,461\n\u200b\n 1\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n 37,851\n\u200b\n 2\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n 10,441\n\u200b\n 1\n%\u00a0\u00a0\nTotal loans\n\u200b\n$\n 2,235,514\n\u200b\n 100\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n$\n 2,191,460\n\u200b\n 100\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n$\n 1,736,343\n\u200b\n 100\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\nOur directors and officers and their affiliates are customers of, and have other transactions with, the Bank in the normal course of business. All loans and commitments included in such transactions were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and do not involve more than normal risk of collection or present other unfavorable features. At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, total loans outstanding to such directors and officers and their affiliates were $73.5 million and $67.1 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2021, $24.7 million of additions and $18.4 million of repayments were made to these loans, compared to $54.7 million of additions and $56.2 million of repayments during the year ended December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, all of the loans to directors and officers were performing according to their original terms.\nLoan categories\nThe principal categories of our loan portfolio are discussed below:\nCommercial and Industrial (C&I). \u00a0\nOur C&I portfolio totaled $366.2 million, $445.0 million and $302.4 million at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and represented 16%, 20% and 17% of our total loans, respectively. C&I loans decreased 17.7% during 2021, primarily the result of significant levels of PPP loans being forgiven during the year. C&I loans increased 47.2% during 2020, primarily as a result of loans made through PPP and secondarily as a result of the Timberwood acquisition. C&I loans increased 1.7% in 2019.\nOur C&I loan customers represent various small and middle-market established businesses involved in professional services, accommodation and food services, health care, financial services, wholesale trade, manufacturing, distribution, retailing and non-profits. Most clients are privately owned with markets that range from local to national in scope. Many of the loans to this segment are secured by liens on corporate assets and the personal guarantees of the principals. The regional economic strength or weakness impacts the relative risks in this loan category. There is little concentration in any one business sector, and loan risks are generally diversified among many borrowers.\nCommercial Real Estate (CRE). \u00a0\nOur CRE loan portfolio totaled $1.11 billion, $992.2 million and $813.1 million at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and represented 50%, 45% and 47% of our total loans, respectively. Our CRE loans increased 12.0% during 2021, primarily as a result of a backlog from 2020 when developers were cautious to start projects during the early stages of COVID-19. Our CRE loans increased 22.0% during 2020, primarily as a result of the Timberwood acquisition. Our CRE loans increased 21.7% during 2019 due primarily to the Partnership acquisition.\nOur CRE loans are secured by a variety of property types including multifamily dwellings, retail facilities, office buildings, commercial mixed use, lodging and industrial and warehouse properties. We do not have any specific industry or customer concentrations in our CRE portfolio. Our commercial real estate\n\u00a0\nloans are generally for terms up to twenty years, with loan-to-values that generally do not exceed 85%. Amortization schedules are long term and thus a balloon payment is generally \n57\n\n\nTable of Contents\ndue at maturity. Under most circumstances, the Bank will offer to rewrite or otherwise extend the loan at prevailing interest rates.\nConstruction and Development (C&D). \u00a0\nOur C&D loan portfolio totaled $132.5 million, $140.1 million and $132.2 million at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and represented 6%, 7% and 8% of our total loans, respectively. C&D loans decreased 5.4% during 2021. C&D loans increased 6.0% during 2020. C&D loans increased 117.4% during 2019 due to a combination of loans acquired in the Partnership acquisition and strong development in both owner-occupied and multifamily developments in our markets due to a continued strong economy.\nOur C&D loans are generally for the purpose of creating value out of real estate through construction and development work, and also include loans used to purchase recreational use land. Borrowers typically provide a copy of a construction or development contract which is subject to bank acceptance prior to loan approval. Disbursements are handled by a title company. Borrowers are required to inject their own equity into the project prior to any note proceeds being disbursed. These loans are, by their nature, intended to be short term and are refinanced into other loan types at the end of the construction and development period.\nResidential 1-4 Family.\n\u00a0\nOur residential 1-4 family loan portfolio totaled $571.8 million, $545.8 million and $448.6 million at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and represented 26%, 25% and 26% of our total loans, respectively. Residential 1-4 family loans increased 4.8% during 2021. Residential 1-4 family loans increased 21.7% during 2020 primarily as a result of the Timberwood transaction. Residential 1-4 family loans increased 21.7% during 2019 primarily as a result of the Partnership transaction.\nWe offer fixed and adjustable rate residential mortgage loans with maturities up to 30 years. One-to-four family residential mortgage loans are generally underwritten according to Fannie Mae guidelines, and we refer to loans that conform to such guidelines as \n\u201c\nconforming loans.\n\u201d\n We generally originate both fixed and adjustable rate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits as established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. In addition, we also offer loans above conforming lending limits typically referred to as \n\u201c\njumbo\n\u201d\n loans. These loans are typically underwritten to the same guidelines as conforming loans; however, we may choose to hold a jumbo loan within its portfolio with underwriting criteria that does not exactly match conforming guidelines.\nWe do not offer reverse mortgages nor do we offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as \n\u201c\nOption ARM\n\u201d\n loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on his loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. We also do not offer \n\u201c\nsubprime loans\n\u201d\n (loans that are made with low down payments to borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgments, bankruptcies, or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high debt-burden ratios) or Alt-A loans (defined as loans having less than full documentation).\nResidential real estate loans are originated both for sale to the secondary market as well as for retention in the Bank\n\u2019\ns loan portfolio. The decision to sell a loan to the secondary market or retain within the portfolio is determined based on a variety of factors including but not limited to our asset/liability position, the current interest rate environment, and customer preference. Servicing rights are retained on all loans sold to the secondary market.\nWe were servicing mortgage loans sold to others without recourse of approximately $705.5 million, $612.7 million and $554.4 million at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nLoans sold with the retention of servicing assets result in the capitalization of servicing rights. Loan servicing rights are included in other assets and are subsequently amortized as an offset to other income over the estimated period of servicing. The net balance of capitalized servicing rights amounted to $5.0\n\u00a0\nmillion, $3.7 million and $4.3 million at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nConsumer Loans. \u00a0\nOur consumer loan portfolio totaled $32.1 million, $30.5 million and $29.6 million at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and represented 1%, 1%, and 2% of our total loans, respectively. Consumer loans include secured and unsecured loans, lines of credit and personal installment loans. Our consumer loans increased by 5.4%, 3.0% and 9.8% during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n58\n\n\nTable of Contents\nConsumer loans generally have greater risk compared to longer-term loans secured by improved, owner-occupied real estate, particularly consumer loans that are secured by rapidly depreciable assets. In these cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance. As a result, consumer loan repayments are dependent on the borrower\n\u2019\ns continuing financial stability and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy.\nOther Loans. \u00a0\nOur other loans totaled $21.5 million, $37.9 million and $10.4 million at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are immaterial to the overall loan portfolio.

The tables do not include any estimate of prepayments, which can significantly shorten the average life of all loans and may cause our actual repayment experience to differ from that shown below.

We have established loan approval policies and procedures to assist us in maintaining the overall quality of our loan portfolio. When delinquencies in our loans exist, we rigorously monitor the levels of such delinquencies for any negative or adverse trends. From time to time, we may modify loans to extend the term or make other concessions to help a borrower with a deteriorating financial condition stay current on their loan and to avoid foreclosure. We generally do not forgive principal or interest on loans or modify the interest rates on loans to rates that are below market rates. Furthermore, we are committed to collecting on all of our loans and, as a result, at times have lower net charge-offs compared to many of our peer banks. We believe that our commitment to collecting on all of our loans results in higher loan recoveries.\nOur nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and foreclosed real estate. Nonperforming loans are those on which the accrual of interest has stopped, as well as loans that are contractually 90 days past due on which interest continues to accrue.

Levels of specific reserves are dependent on the specific underlying impaired loans at any given time. Management has evaluated the aforementioned loans and other loans classified as nonperforming and believes that all nonperforming loans have been adequately reserved for in the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2021.\nOur nonperforming assets were elevated during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, primarily due to the acquisition of a troubled institution during 2017, which included $19.4 million of loans which were considered nonperforming. This increase in nonperforming assets was anticipated in conjunction with the acquisition, and management actively managed these relationships out of the Bank through pay downs, refinances with or sales of loans to other institutions, or foreclosure actions. As a result of these actions nonperforming assets declined sharply during 2019. Nonperforming assets trended back up slightly during 2020 primarily due to one commercial real estate loan totaling approximately $7.3 million which was moved to nonaccrual status when a major tenant declared bankruptcy and vacated the facility. Payments continued to be made timely on this loan, and it returned to performing status during 2021, causing a decline in nonperforming assets.\nNonaccrual Loans\nLoans are typically placed on nonaccrual status when any payment of principal and/or interest is 90 days or more past due, unless the collateral is sufficient to cover both principal and interest and the loan is in the process of collection. Loans are also placed on nonaccrual status when management believes, after considering economic and business conditions, that the principal or interest will not be collectible in the normal course of business. We monitor closely the performance of our loan portfolio. In addition to the monitoring and review of loan performance internally, we have also contracted with an independent organization to review our commercial and retail loan portfolios. The status of delinquent loans, as well as situations identified as potential problems, is reviewed on a regular basis by senior management.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings\nA troubled debt restructuring includes a loan modification where a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and we grant a concession to that borrower that we would not otherwise consider except for the borrower\u2019s financial difficulties. These concessions may include modifications of the terms of the debt such as deferral of payments, extension of maturity, reduction of principal balance, reduction of the stated interest rate other than normal market rate adjustments, or a combination of these concessions. Debt may be bifurcated with separate terms for each tranche of the restructured debt. Restructuring a loan in lieu of aggressively enforcing the collection of the loan may benefit the Company by increasing the ultimate probability of collection.\nA TDR may be either on accrual or nonaccrual status based upon the performance of the borrower and management\u2019s assessment of collectability. If a TDR is placed on nonaccrual status, which would occur based on the same criteria as non-TDR loans, it remains there until a sufficient period of performance under the restructured terms has occurred at which it returned to accrual status, generally 6 months.\n61\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CARES Act was signed into law. Under the CARES Act, banks may elect to deem that loan modifications do not result in TDRs if they are (1) related to COVID-19; (2) executed on a loan that was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019; and (3) executed between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of (A) 60 days after the date of termination of the national emergency declaration or (B) December 31, 2021. Additionally, in accordance with the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (Revised), other short-term modifications made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who were current prior to any relief are not TDRs under ASC Subtopic 310-40. This includes short-term (e.g. up to six months) modifications such as payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or delays in payment that are insignificant. Borrowers considered current are those that are less than 30 days past due on their contractual payments at the time a modification program is implemented. Loans modified under this guidance are not considered TDRs and as such are not identified in the table below. During 2020, the Company granted payment deferrals to over 625 customers on loans totaling over $271 .5 million. These deferrals were primarily for lengths in the range of 60 to 180 days, and were a combination of deferrals of principal payments only or both principal and interest payments. As of December 31, 2020, these totals had decreased to fewer than 20 loans with total balances less than $20.0 million. As of December 31, 2021, only one loan remained with payment deferrals under the CARES Act, totaling $1.1 million.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had specific reserves of $7,000 and $0 for TDRs, respectively, and none of them have subsequently defaulted.\nALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES\nALLL represents management\u2019s estimate of probable and inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio. Estimating the amount of the ALLL require the exercise of significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows or impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogenous loans based on historical loss experience, and consideration of other qualitative factors such as current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. The loan portfolio also represents the largest asset on the consolidated balance sheets. Loan losses are charged off against the ALLL, while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the ALLL. A provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management\u2019s periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned, as well as other pertinent factors.\nThe ALLL consists of specific reserves for certain individually evaluated impaired loans and general reserves for collectively evaluated non-impaired loans. Specific reserves reflect estimated losses on impaired loans from management\u2019s analyses developed through specific credit allocations. The specific reserves are based on regular analyses of impaired, non-homogenous loans greater than $250,000. These analyses involve a high degree of judgment in estimating the amount of loss associated with specific loans, including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values. The general reserve is based in part on the Bank\u2019s historical loss experience which is updated quarterly. The general reserve portion of the ALLL also includes consideration of certain qualitative factors such as (1) changes in lending policies and/or underwriting practices, (2) national and local economic conditions, (3) changes in portfolio volume and nature, (4) experience, ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff, (5) levels of and trends in past-due and nonaccrual loans and quality, (6) changes in loan review and oversight, (7) impact and effects of concentrations and (8) other issues deemed relevant.\nThere are many factors affecting the ALLL; some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment. The process for determining the ALLL (which management believes adequately considers potential factors which might possibly result in credit losses) includes subjective elements and, therefore, may be susceptible to significant change. To the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates, additional provision for loan losses could be required that could adversely affect our earnings or financial position in future periods. Allocations of the ALLL may be made for specific loans but the entire ALLL is available for any loan that, in management\u2019s judgment, should be charged off or for which an actual loss is realized. As an integral part of their examination process, various regulatory agencies review the ALLL as well. Such agencies may require that changes in the ALLL be recognized when such regulators\u2019 credit evaluations differ from those of management based on information available to the regulators at the time of their examinations.\n62\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the changes in our ALLL for the years indicated:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nYear ended December\u00a031,\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n2021\n\u200b\n2020\n\u200b\n2019\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n(dollars in thousands)\nBalance of ALLL at the beginning of period\n\u00a0\n$\n 17,658\n\u00a0\n$\n 11,396\n\u00a0\n$\n 12,248\n\u00a0\nNet loans charged-off (recovered):\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\nCommercial & industrial\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n 180\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n 1,083\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n 1,218\n\u00a0\nCommercial real estate - owner occupied\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n 275\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n (346)\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n 4,638\n\u00a0\nCommercial real estate - non-owner occupied\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n (5)\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n (40)\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n 2\n\u00a0\nConstruction & Development\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n (143)\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n 33\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n 0\n\u00a0\nResidential 1-4 family\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n 110\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n 21\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n 146\n\u00a0\nConsumer\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n 6\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n 90\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n 65\n\u00a0\nOther Loans\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n 20\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n 22\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n 33\n\u00a0\nTotal net loans charged-off\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n 443\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n 863\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n 6,102\n\u00a0\nProvision charged to operating expense\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n 3,100\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n 7,125\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n 5,250\n\u00a0\nBalance of ALLL at end of period\n\u200b\n$\n 20,315\n\u200b\n$\n 17,658\n\u200b\n$\n 11,396\n\u200b\nRatio of net charge-offs (recoveries) to average loans by loan composition\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nCommercial & industrial\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 0.05\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n0.23\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 0.41\n%\u00a0\u00a0\nCommercial real estate - owner occupied\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 0.05\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n (0.07)\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 1.07\n%\u00a0\u00a0\nCommercial real estate - non-owner occupied\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 0.00\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n (0.01)\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 0.00\n%\u00a0\u00a0\nConstruction & Development\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (0.11)\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 0.02\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 0.00\n%\u00a0\u00a0\nResidential 1-4 family\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 0.02\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 0.00\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 0.04\n%\u00a0\u00a0\nConsumer\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 0.02\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 0.31\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 0.22\n%\u00a0\u00a0\nOther Loans\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 0.07\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 0.16\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 0.47\n%\u00a0\u00a0\nTotal net charge-offs to average loans\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 0.02\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 0.04\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 0.39\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\nThe level of charge-offs depends on many factors, including the national and regional economy. Cyclical lagging factors may result in charge-offs being higher than historical levels. The dollar amount of the ALLL increased primarily as a result of loan growth and changes in the portfolio composition. Although the allowance is allocated between categories, the entire allowance is available to absorb losses attributable to all loan categories.

We continue to focus on growing core deposits through our relationship driven banking philosophy and community-focused marketing programs. We also borrow from the FHLB of Chicago to supplement cash needs, to lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk management purposes and to manage our cost of funds. Our additional sources of funds are scheduled payments and prepayments of principal and interest on loans and investment securities and fee income and proceeds from the sales of loans and securities.\nDeposits.\n \u00a0Our current deposit products include non-interest bearing and interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, and certificate of deposits. As of December 31, 2021, deposit liabilities accounted for approximately 86.1% of our total liabilities and equity. We accept deposits primarily from customers in the communities in which our branches and offices are located, as well as from small businesses and other customers throughout our lending area. We rely on our competitive pricing and products, quality customer service, and convenient locations and hours to attract and retain deposits. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current business strategies, market interest rates, liquidity requirements and our deposit growth goals.\nTotal deposits were $2.53 billion, $2.32 billion and $1.84 billion as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Noninterest-bearing deposits at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $799.9 million, $715.6 million and $476.5 million, respectively, while interest-bearing deposits were $1.73 billion, $1.61 billion and $1.37 billion at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had a total of $256.2 million in certificates of deposit, including $11.7 million of brokered deposits, of which $5.0 million had remaining maturities of one year or less. Based on historical experience and our current pricing strategy, we believe we will retain a large portion of these accounts upon maturity.\nThe following tables set forth the average balances of our deposits for the periods indicated:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nDecember\u00a031,\u00a0\n\u200b\nDecember\u00a031,\u00a0\n\u200b\nDecember\u00a031,\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n2021\n\u200b\n2020\n\u200b\n2019\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAmount\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPercent\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAmount\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPercent\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAmount\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPercent\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n(dollars in thousands)\nNoninterest-bearing demand deposits\n\u200b\n$\n 785,364\n\u200b\n 32.0\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n$\n 634,939\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n 29.7\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n$\n 495,039\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n29.4\n%\u00a0\u00a0\nInterest-bearing checking deposits\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 209,970\n\u200b\n 8.6\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 194,718\n\u200b\n 9.1\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 90,273\n\u200b\n5.4\n%\u00a0\u00a0\nSavings deposits\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 497,958\n\u00a0\n 20.3\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 356,091\n\u00a0\n 16.7\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 261,977\n\u00a0\n 15.6\n%\u00a0\u00a0\nMoney market accounts\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 664,591\n\u00a0\n 27.1\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 563,847\n\u00a0\n 26.4\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 440,773\n\u00a0\n 26.2\n%\u00a0\u00a0\nCertificates of deposit\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 278,602\n\u00a0\n 11.4\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 367,054\n\u00a0\n 17.2\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 380,117\n\u00a0\n 22.6\n%\u00a0\u00a0\nBrokered deposits\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 14,718\n\u00a0\n 0.6\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 18,428\n\u00a0\n 0.9\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n 16,387\n\u00a0\n 0.9\n%\u00a0\u00a0\nTotal\n\u200b\n$\n 2,451,203\n\u00a0\n 100\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n$\n 2,135,077\n\u00a0\n 100\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n$\n 1,684,566\n\u00a0\n 100\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\nThe following table provides information on maturities of certificates of deposits which exceed FDIC insurance limits of $250,000 as of December 31, 2021:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nTime Deposits over FDIC \n\u200b\nPortion of Time Deposits in\n\u200b\n\u200b\nInsurance Limits\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nExcess of FDIC Insurance Limits\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n(dollars in thousands)\n3 months or less remaining\n\u200b\n$\n 8,958\n\u200b\n$\n 2,458\nOver 3 to 6 months remaining\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 8,538\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 4,788\nOver 6 to 12 months remaining\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 5,847\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 3,597\nOver 12 months or more remaining\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 13,445\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 5,445\nTotal\n\u200b\n$\n 36,788\n\u200b\n$\n 16,288\n\u200b\n64\n\n\nTable of Contents\nBorrowings\nDeposits and investment securities for sale are the primary source of funds for our lending activities and general business purposes.

securities for other-than-temporary impairment on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such evaluation. Consideration is given to (1) credit quality of individual securities and their issuers are assessed; (2) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; (3) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and (4) that the Company does not have the intent to sell the security and it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis.\nAs of December 31, 2021, 26 debt securities had gross unrealized losses, with an aggregate depreciation of 0.98% from our amortized cost basis. The largest unrealized loss percentage of any single security was 5.31% (or $256,000) of its amortized cost. This was also the largest unrealized dollar loss of any single security.\nAs of December 31, 2020, six debt securities had gross unrealized losses, with an aggregate depreciation of 0.08% from our amortized cost basis. The largest unrealized loss percentage of any single security was 1.86% (or $74,000) of its amortized cost. This was also the largest unrealized dollar loss of any single security.\n68\n\n\nTable of Contents\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity. \u00a0 \u00a0\nLiquidity is defined as the Company\u2019s ability to generate adequate cash to meet its needs for day-to-day operations and material long and short-term commitments. Liquidity is the risk of potential loss if we were unable to meet our funding requirements at a reasonable cost. We are expected to maintain adequate liquidity at the Bank to meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs. Our asset and liability management policy is intended to cause the Bank to maintain adequate liquidity and, therefore, enhance our ability to raise funds to support asset growth, meet deposit withdrawals and lending needs, maintain reserve requirements and otherwise sustain our operations.\nWe continuously monitor our liquidity position to ensure that assets and liabilities are managed in a manner that will meet all of our short-term and long-term cash requirements. We manage our liquidity based on demand and specific events and uncertainties to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term nature. We also monitor our liquidity requirements in light of interest rate trends, changes in the economy and the scheduled maturity and interest rate sensitivity of the investment and loan portfolios and deposits. Our objective in managing liquidity is to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers as well as to increase earnings enhancement opportunities in a changing marketplace.\nOur liquidity is maintained through investment portfolio, deposits, borrowings from the FHLB, and lines available from correspondent banks. Our highest priority is placed on growing noninterest bearing deposits through strong community involvement in the markets that we serve. Borrowings and brokered deposits are considered short-term supplements to our overall liquidity but are not intended to be relied upon for long-term needs. We believe that our present position is adequate to meet our current and future liquidity needs, and management knows of no trend or event that will have a material impact on the Company\u2019s ability to maintain liquidity at satisfactory levels.\nCapital Adequacy. \u00a0\nTotal shareholders\u2019 equity was $322.7 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $294.9 million at December 31, 2020, and $230.2 million at December 31, 2019. Our total shareholders\u2019 equity increased during 2021, 2020 and 2019 as a result of our profitability, reduced by dividends paid and common share repurchases. Growth in shareholders\u2019 equity during 2020 and 2019 was further stimulated by the acquisitions of Timberwood and Partnership in these years, respectively.\nOur capital management consists of providing adequate equity to support our current and future operations. We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve and the OCC. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may prompt certain actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measure of their assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and the classifications are also subject to qualitative judgment by the regulator in regards to risk weighting and other factors.

RISK\nWe are party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments primarily include commitments to originate and sell loans, standby and direct pay letters of credit, unused lines of credit and unadvanced portions of construction and development loans. The instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. The contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Company has in these particular classes of financial instruments.\nOur exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for loan commitments, standby and direct pay letters of credit and unadvanced portions of construction and development loans is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements.\nOur significant off-balance-sheet arrangements consist of the following:\n\u25cf\nUnused lines of credit\n\u25cf\nStandby and direct pay letters of credit\n\u25cf\nCredit card arrangements\n\u200b\nOff-balance sheet arrangement means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the registrant is a party, under which the registrant has (1) any obligation under a guarantee contract, (2) retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement, (3) any obligation, including a contingent obligation, under a contract that would be accounted for as a derivative instrument, or (4) any obligation, including a contingent obligation, arising out of a variable interest.\nLoan commitments are made to accommodate the financial needs of our customers. Standby and direct pay letters of credit commit us to make payments on behalf of customers when certain specified future events occur. Both arrangements have credit risk essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to clients and are subject to our normal credit policies. Collateral (e.g., securities, receivables, inventory, equipment, etc.) is obtained based on management\u2019s credit assessment of the customer.\nLoan commitments and standby and direct pay letters of credit do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements because while the borrower has the ability to draw upon these commitments at any time, these commitments occasionally expire without being drawn upon.

While a financial institution\u2019s operating expenses, particularly salary and employee benefits, are affected by general inflation, the asset and liability structure of a financial institution consists largely of monetary items. Monetary items, such as cash, investments, loans, deposits and other borrowings, are those assets and liabilities which are or will be converted into a fixed number of dollars regardless of changes in prices. As a result, changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution\u2019s performance than does general inflation. For additional information regarding interest rates and changes in net interest income see \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u2014Interest Rate Sensitivity.\u201d Inflation may have impacts on the Bank\u2019s customers, on businesses and consumers and their ability or willingness to invest, save or spend, and perhaps on their ability to repay loans. As such, there would likely be impacts on the general appetite of banking products and the credit health of the Bank\u2019s customer base.", "item7a": ">ITEM 7A. \u00a0 \u00a0 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates. Our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending, investment and deposit-taking activities. To that end, management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure.\nOur profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact our earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed, to the same extent or on the same basis. We monitor the impact of changes in interest rates on its net interest income using several tools.\nOur primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and capital, while configuring our asset-liability structure to obtain the maximum yield-cost spread on that structure. We rely primarily on our asset-liability structure to control interest rate risk.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity. \u00a0 \u00a0\nInterest rate risk is the risk to earnings and value arising from changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk arises from timing differences in the repricings and maturities of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities (repricing risk), changes in the expected maturities of assets and liabilities arising from embedded options, such as borrowers\u2019 ability to prepay home mortgage loans at any time and depositors\u2019 ability to redeem certificates of deposit before maturity (option risk), changes in the shape of the yield curve where interest rates increase or decrease in a nonparallel fashion (yield curve risk), and changes in spread relationships between different yield curves, such as U.S. Treasuries and LIBOR (basis risk).\nAn asset sensitive position refers to a balance sheet position in which an increase in short-term interest rates is expected to generate higher net interest income, as rates earned on our interest-earning assets would reprice upward more quickly than rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities, thus expanding our net interest margin. Conversely, a liability sensitive position refers to a balance sheet position in which an increase in short-term interest rates is expected to generate lower net interest income, as rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities would reprice upward more quickly than rates earned on our interest-earning assets, thus compressing our net interest margin.\nThe Company actively manages its interest rate sensitivity position. The objectives of interest rate risk management are to control exposure of net interest income to risks associated with interest rate movements and to achieve sustainable growth in net interest income. The Company\u2019s ALCO, using policies and procedures approved by the Company\u2019s board of directors, is responsible for the management of the Company\u2019s interest rate sensitivity position. The Company manages interest rate sensitivity by changing the mix, pricing and re-pricing characteristics of its assets and liabilities, through the management of its investment portfolio, its offerings of loan and selected deposit terms and through wholesale funding. Wholesale funding consists of, but is not limited to, multiple sources including borrowings with the FHLB of Chicago, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago\u2019s discount window and certificates of deposit from institutional brokers.\n73\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe Company uses several tools to manage its interest rate risk including interest rate sensitivity analysis, or gap analysis, market value of portfolio equity analysis, interest rate simulations under various rate scenarios and net interest margin reports. The results of these reports are compared to limits established by the Company\u2019s ALCO policies and appropriate adjustments are made if the results are outside the established limits.\nThere are an infinite number of potential interest rate scenarios, each of which can be accompanied by differing economic/political/regulatory climates; can generate multiple differing behavior patterns by markets, borrowers, depositors, etc.; and, can last for varying degrees of time. Therefore, by definition, interest rate risk sensitivity cannot be predicted with certainty. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s interest rate risk measurement philosophy focuses on maintaining an appropriate balance between theoretical and practical scenarios; especially given the primary objective of the Company\u2019s overall asset/liability management process is to facilitate meaningful strategy development and implementation.\nTherefore, we model a set of interest rate scenarios capturing the financial effects of a range of plausible rate scenarios; the collective impact of which will enable the Company to clearly understand the nature and extent of its sensitivity to interest rate changes. Doing so necessitates\nan assessment of rate changes over varying time horizons and of varying/sufficient degrees such that the impact of embedded options within the balance sheet are sufficiently examined.\nThe following tables demonstrate the annualized result of an interest rate simulation and the estimated effect that a parallel interest rate shift, or \u201cshock,\u201d in the yield curve and subjective adjustments in deposit pricing might have on the Company\u2019s projected net interest income over the next 12 months.\nThis simulation assumes that there is no growth in interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities over the next 12 months. The changes to net interest income shown below are in compliance with the Company\u2019s policy guidelines.\nAs of December 31, 2021:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nChange in Interest Rates\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPercentage Change in  \n(in Basis Points)\n\u00a0\nNet Interest Income\n+400\n\u00a0\n9.3%\n+300\n\u00a0\n7.6%\n+200\n\u00a0\n6.2%\n+100\n\u00a0\n3.6%\n-100\n\u00a0\n(4.3)%\n\u200b\nAs of December 31, 2020:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nChange in Interest Rates\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPercentage\u00a0Change in\u00a0\n (in Basis Points)\n\u200b\nNet\u00a0Interest Income\n+400\n\u00a0\n4.7%\n+300\n\u00a0\n4.2%\n+200\n\u00a0\n3.9%\n+100\n\u00a0\n2.7%\n-100\n\u00a0\n(3.3)%\n\u200b\n74\n\n\nTable of Contents\nEconomic Value of Equity Analysis. \u00a0 \u00a0\nWe also analyze the sensitivity of the Company\u2019s financial condition to changes in interest rates through our economic value of equity model. This analysis measures the difference between estimated changes in the present value of the Company\u2019s assets and estimated changes in the present value of the Company\u2019s liabilities assuming various changes in current interest rates. The Company\u2019s economic value of equity analysis as of December 31, 2021 estimated that, in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point increase in interest rates, the Company would experience a 8.89% increase in the economic value of equity. At the same date, our analysis estimated that, in the event of an instantaneous 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, the Company would experience 9.21% decrease in the economic value of equity. The estimates of changes in the economic value of our equity require us to make certain assumptions including loan and mortgage-related investment prepayment speeds, reinvestment rates, and deposit maturities and decay rates. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, we cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on the economic value of our equity. Although our economic value of equity analysis provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such estimates are not intended to, and do not, provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the economic value of our equity and will differ from actual results.\n\u200b\n75\n\n\nTable of Contents", "companyName": "BANK FIRST NATIONAL CORP", "cusip": "063671101"}
