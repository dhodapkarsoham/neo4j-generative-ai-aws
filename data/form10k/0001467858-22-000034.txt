{"item1": ">Item\u00a01. Business \nGeneral Motors Company (sometimes referred to as we, our, us, ourselves, the Company, General Motors, or GM) was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 2009. We design, build and sell trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts and provide software-enabled services and subscriptions worldwide. Our automotive operations meet the demands of our customers through our automotive segments: GM North America (GMNA) and GM International (GMI) with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries, primarily in China, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Baojun, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and Wuling brands. Cruise is our global segment responsible for the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicle technology. We provide automotive financing services through our General Motors Financial Company, Inc. (GM Financial) segment. Refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) and Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information about our segments. Except for per share amounts or as otherwise specified, amounts presented within tables are stated in millions. Forward-looking statements in this Business section are not guarantees of future performance and may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors and the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" section of Part II, Item 7. MD&A for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties.\nOur vision for the future is a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion, which guides our growth-focused strategy to invest in electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs), software-enabled services and subscriptions and new business opportunities, while strengthening our market position in profitable internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, such as trucks and sport utility vehicles (SUVs). We have committed to an all-electric future with a core focus on zero emission battery EVs as part of our long-term strategy to reduce petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. As a result, we have committed to making total EV and AV investments of more than $35.0\u00a0billion from 2020 through 2025.\nWe have an opportunity to grow our vehicle and financing revenue by continuing to capitalize on the strength of our franchises and scaling our EV production and customer base over the next decade. We also have the potential of growing our revenue through our software-enabled services and subscriptions, including OnStar, our advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS), Super Cruise, and future offerings, such as our next-generation ADAS, Ultra Cruise, and Ultifi. Additionally, we are incubating several new businesses with a start-up mindset that we believe will enable us to attract new customers and generate revenues in new areas.\nElectric Vehicles  \nWe plan to launch more than 30 EVs globally by 2025. A key element in our EV strategy is Ultium, our all-new dedicated battery electric platform. Our first Ultium-based products launched with the GMC HUMMER EV and BrightDrop EV600 in 2021, to be followed by the Cadillac LYRIQ in 2022. This all-new platform is flexible and will be leveraged across multiple brands and vehicle sizes, styles and drive configurations, allowing for quick response to customer preferences and a shorter design and development lead time compared to our ICE vehicles.\nIn September 2021, we announced three new drive assist motors as part of Ultium Drive, calibrated in-house to ensure the highest level of performance in Ultium-based EVs. We designed the motors as a scalable family, sharing design principles as well as similar tooling and manufacturing strategies. \nIn November 2021, we began production at GM\u2019s Factory ZERO Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center (Factory ZERO), which was re-tooled into a fully dedicated EV facility to produce the GMC HUMMER EV and the upcoming Cruise Origin and Chevrolet Silverado EV, which we revealed in January 2022 at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada. In January 2022, we announced that we will convert our assembly plant in Orion Township, Michigan for production of the Chevrolet Silverado EV and the electric GMC Sierra. Additionally, we have announced plans to mass-produce battery cells for these and other future EVs through Ultium Cells LLC (an equally owned joint venture with LG Energy Solution) in Lordstown, Ohio, Spring Hill, Tennessee and Lansing, Michigan. A fourth U.S.-based battery cell plant is also planned by mid-decade. \nTo support mass market adoption of EVs, we are working to ensure that our customers will have access to comprehensive charging solutions. For personal vehicles, this means strategically addressing charging needs at home, the workplace and in public locations. For fleet vehicles, this means turnkey charging solutions and fleet and facility energy management services. We have announced collaborative work with several charge network operators to filter real-time data on their respective \n1\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nnetworks and charge station health into Ultium Charge 360, a holistic charging approach that integrates charging networks, GM vehicle mobile apps and other products and services to simplify the overall charging experience for GM EV owners.\nUltium Charge 360 is also available to our fleet and BrightDrop customers and offers fleet and facility management tools, integration with GM\u2019s fleet management offerings and support across a wide range of fleet sizes. In October 2021, we announced a new Dealer Community Charging Program to install up to 40,000 Level 2 EV chargers across the U.S. and Canada. Working with our dealers, we intend to expand access to charging in local communities, including in underserved, rural and urban areas where EV charging access is often limited. This initiative, which is expected to begin in 2022, is part of our commitment to invest nearly $750 million to expand home, workplace and public charging infrastructure through the Ultium Charge 360 ecosystem through 2025.\nOnStar and Vehicle Connectivity  \nWe offer OnStar and connected services to more than 22 million connected vehicles globally through subscription-based and complimentary services. We are among the leaders in the industry, with significant global real-world experience in delivering connected services and advanced safety features. OnStar provides safety and security services for retail and fleet customers, including automatic crash response, emergency services, roadside assistance, crisis assist, stolen vehicle assistance and turn-by-turn navigation. Additionally, we offer OnStar Guardian, a mobile app that allows customers to access key OnStar safety and security services from anywhere and in any vehicle. Fleet customers leverage OnStar Vehicle Insights, our telematics solution across their entire fleet, regardless of vehicle make or model. We also offer a variety of connected services, including mobile apps for owners to remotely control certain vehicle features and EV owners to locate charging stations, on-demand vehicle diagnostics, GM Smart Driver, GM Marketplace in-vehicle commerce, Amazon Alexa in-vehicle voice, Google's Voice Assistant, navigation and app ecosystem, connected navigation and SiriusXM with 360L and 4G LTE wireless connectivity. In August 2021, we announced plans to roll out 5G connectivity in select model year 2024 vehicles.\nSuper Cruise and Ultra Cruise  \nWe offer Super Cruise, the industry's first hands-free driver assistance feature for enabled roads in the U.S. and Canada, which is powered by vehicle connectivity by means of a Super Cruise subscription. Super Cruise capabilities will be available on eight model year 2022 vehicles in the beginning of 2022 and will expand to be included on more than 20 models by 2023. In October 2021, we announced Ultra Cruise, a significant next step in hands-free advanced driving-assistance technology that we anticipate will be available on select models in 2023. It will create a virtually door-to-door hands-free driving experience as it will be designed to handle 95 percent of all driving scenarios on every paved road in the U.S. and Canada over time.\nUltifi\n  Our end-to-end software platform Ultifi will provide our customers with software-defined features, apps and services over-the-air starting in 2023. Ultifi and the apps it enables will empower customers to update their ownership experiences continuously with desirable features such as vehicle performance, ADAS, safety and security features, climate and comfort options, personal themes and EV ownership experience elements, including battery and charging details. \nCruise\n  Cruise is driving leadership in the development and commercialization of AV technology. We believe that building all-electric vehicles with autonomous capabilities integrated from the beginning, rather than through retrofits, is the most efficient way to unlock the tremendous potential societal benefits of self-driving cars. The Cruise Origin, a purpose-built, all-electric, self-driving vehicle that is being co-developed by GM, Cruise and Honda Motor Company, Ltd. (Honda), will be built on General Motors\u2019 all-new modular architecture, powered by the Ultium platform, at Factory ZERO starting in early 2023, pending government approvals. In October 2020, Cruise received a driverless test permit from the California Department of Motor Vehicles to remove test drivers from Cruise autonomous test vehicles in San Francisco and subsequently began fully driverless testing. In October 2020, GM and Cruise also announced they will file an exemption petition with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) seeking regulatory approval for the Origin\u2019s deployment, and withdrew an earlier exemption petition that was limited to the Cruise AV derived from the Chevrolet Bolt platform.\nIn June 2021, Cruise received a driverless test permit from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to provide unpaid rides to the public in driverless vehicles. In September 2021, Cruise received approval of its Autonomous Vehicle Deployment Permit from the California Department of Motor Vehicles to commercially deploy driverless AVs. Cruise will need one additional permit from the CPUC to charge the public for driverless rides in California. Given the potential of all-electric self-driving vehicles to help save lives, reshape our cities and reduce emissions, the goal of Cruise is to deliver its self-driving services as soon as possible, but as Cruise continues to expand and scale its operations safety will continue to be the gating metric \u2014 supported by Cruise's Safety Management System and its other risk identification, assessment and mitigation processes.\nBrightDrop\n  BrightDrop is building an ecosystem of all-electric and connected first-to-last mile products and services, including light commercial vehicles, smart containers and a software platform for fleet and asset management designed to help delivery and logistics companies deliver goods more efficiently. We are converting our CAMI manufacturing plant in Ingersoll, \n2\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOntario to produce the all new BrightDrop EV600 and BrightDrop EV410 electric light commercial vehicles. In December 2021, we started deliveries of the BrightDrop EV600 to FedEx Express, our launch customer. Additionally, we announced that Verizon will be the first customer for the BrightDrop EV410.\nHYDROTEC\n  We are developing hydrogen fuel cell applications across transportations and industries, including mobile power generation, class 7/8 truck, locomotive, aerospace and marine applications. The development of HYDROTEC is another element of our long-term strategy and commitment toward the reduction of petroleum consumption and GHG emissions. We believe hydrogen fuel cells will play an important role in many automotive and other mobility applications where customers will derive additional benefits from the ability to refuel quickly, an extended range, suitability for heavier payloads and central refueling of large fleets. GM and Honda, through our long-term strategic alliance to collaborate in research and advanced engineering efforts, are developing and commercializing fuel cell systems. In 2021, GM announced it will supply HYDROTEC to Navistar, Inc., which is developing hydrogen-powered heavy trucks to launch in 2024, and to Liebherr-Aerospace, which is developing hydrogen-powered auxiliary power units for aircraft. In June 2021, we announced a collaboration with Wabtec Corporation to develop and commercialize the Ultium platform and HYDROTEC fuel systems for their locomotives. \nOnStar Insurance Services\n  OnStar Insurance is currently available in 46 states and Washington, D.C. and is expected to be available in all 50 states by the second quarter of 2022. In the future, we plan to integrate insurance products into the vehicle experience and offer premiums based on personal driving behaviors by leveraging, with customer consent, data coming from GM vehicles.\nGM Defense\n  Providing commercially developed solutions, including purpose-built vehicles, for government and military customers. GM Defense's growth strategy is focused on building a portfolio of products, including the Infantry Squad Vehicle and the purpose-built Heavy Duty Suburban, by leveraging our manufacturing and innovation capabilities.\nCompetitive Position and Vehicle Sales  \nThe principal factors that determine consumer vehicle preferences in the markets in which we operate include overall vehicle design, price, quality, available options, safety, reliability, fuel economy and functionality. Market leadership in individual countries in which we compete varies widely.\nWe present both wholesale and total vehicle sales data to assist in the analysis of our revenue and our market share. Wholesale vehicle sales data consists of sales to GM's dealers and distributors as well as sales to the U.S. Government and excludes vehicles sold by our joint ventures. Wholesale vehicle sales data correlates to our revenue recognized from the sale of vehicles, which is the largest component of Automotive net sales and revenue. In the year ended December 31, 2021, 30% of our wholesale vehicle sales volume was generated outside the U.S. The following table summarizes wholesale vehicle sales by automotive segment (vehicles in thousands): \nYears Ended December 31,\n2021\n2020\n2019\nGMNA\n2,308\u00a0\n80.7\u00a0\n%\n2,707\u00a0\n80.3\u00a0\n%\n3,214\u00a0\n76.4\u00a0\n%\nGMI\n551\u00a0\n19.3\u00a0\n%\n663\u00a0\n19.7\u00a0\n%\n995\u00a0\n23.6\u00a0\n%\nTotal\n2,859\u00a0\n100.0\u00a0\n%\n3,370\u00a0\n100.0\u00a0\n%\n4,209\u00a0\n100.0\u00a0\n%\nTotal vehicle sales data represents: (1) retail sales (i.e., sales to consumers who purchase new vehicles from dealers or distributors); (2) fleet sales, such as sales to large and small businesses, governments, and daily rental car companies; and (3) vehicles used by dealers in their businesses, including courtesy transportation vehicles. Total vehicle sales data includes all sales by joint ventures on a total vehicle basis, not based on our percentage ownership interest in the joint venture. Certain joint venture agreements in China allow for the contractual right to report vehicle sales of non-GM trademarked vehicles by those joint ventures, which are included in the total vehicle sales we report for China. While total vehicle sales data does not correlate directly to the revenue we recognize during a particular period, we believe it is indicative of the underlying demand for our vehicles. Total vehicle sales data represents management's good faith estimate based on sales reported by GM's dealers, distributors, and joint ventures, commercially available data sources such as registration and insurance data, and internal estimates and forecasts when other data is not available.\n3\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n The following table summarizes industry and GM total vehicle sales and our related competitive position by geographic region (vehicles in thousands): \n\u00a0\nYears Ended December\u00a031,\n\u00a0\n2021\n2020\n2019\n\u00a0\nIndustry\nGM\nMarket Share\nIndustry\nGM\nMarket Share\nIndustry\nGM\nMarket Share\nNorth America\nUnited States\n15,383\u00a0\n2,218\u00a0\n14.4\u00a0\n%\n14,892\u00a0\n2,547\u00a0\n17.1\u00a0\n%\n17,499\u00a0\n2,887\u00a0\n16.5\u00a0\n%\nOther\n3,083\u00a0\n356\u00a0\n11.5\u00a0\n%\n2,804\u00a0\n377\u00a0\n13.4\u00a0\n%\n3,645\u00a0\n480\u00a0\n13.2\u00a0\n%\nTotal North America\n18,466\u00a0\n2,574\u00a0\n13.9\u00a0\n%\n17,696\u00a0\n2,924\u00a0\n16.5\u00a0\n%\n21,144\u00a0\n3,367\u00a0\n15.9\u00a0\n%\nAsia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa\nChina(a)\n25,878\u00a0\n2,892\u00a0\n11.2\u00a0\n%\n24,926\u00a0\n2,901\u00a0\n11.6\u00a0\n%\n25,398\u00a0\n3,094\u00a0\n12.2\u00a0\n%\nOther\n19,389\u00a0\n431\u00a0\n2.2\u00a0\n%\n18,094\u00a0\n530\u00a0\n2.9\u00a0\n%\n21,457\u00a0\n584\u00a0\n2.7\u00a0\n%\nTotal Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa\n45,267\u00a0\n3,323\u00a0\n7.3\u00a0\n%\n43,020\u00a0\n3,431\u00a0\n8.0\u00a0\n%\n46,855\u00a0\n3,678\u00a0\n7.9\u00a0\n%\nSouth America\nBrazil\n2,119\u00a0\n242\u00a0\n11.4\u00a0\n%\n2,055\u00a0\n338\u00a0\n16.4\u00a0\n%\n2,787\u00a0\n476\u00a0\n17.1\u00a0\n%\nOther\n1,488\u00a0\n151\u00a0\n10.2\u00a0\n%\n1,105\u00a0\n132\u00a0\n12.0\u00a0\n%\n1,531\u00a0\n193\u00a0\n12.6\u00a0\n%\nTotal South America\n3,607\u00a0\n393\u00a0\n10.9\u00a0\n%\n3,160\u00a0\n470\u00a0\n14.9\u00a0\n%\n4,318\u00a0\n669\u00a0\n15.5\u00a0\n%\nTotal in GM markets\n67,340\u00a0\n6,290\u00a0\n9.3\u00a0\n%\n63,876\u00a0\n6,825\u00a0\n10.7\u00a0\n%\n72,317\u00a0\n7,714\u00a0\n10.7\u00a0\n%\nTotal Europe\n15,080\u00a0\n1\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n%\n14,946\u00a0\n1\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n%\n19,021\u00a0\n4\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n%\nTotal Worldwide(b)\n82,420\u00a0\n6,291\u00a0\n7.6\u00a0\n%\n78,822\u00a0\n6,826\u00a0\n8.7\u00a0\n%\n91,338\u00a0\n7,718\u00a0\n8.4\u00a0\n%\nUnited States\nCars\n3,262\u00a0\n138\u00a0\n4.2\u00a0\n%\n3,341\u00a0\n239\u00a0\n7.1\u00a0\n%\n4,632\u00a0\n389\u00a0\n8.4\u00a0\n%\nTrucks\n4,125\u00a0\n1,223\u00a0\n29.6\u00a0\n%\n4,050\u00a0\n1,257\u00a0\n31.0\u00a0\n%\n4,494\u00a0\n1,332\u00a0\n29.7\u00a0\n%\nCrossovers\n7,996\u00a0\n857\u00a0\n10.7\u00a0\n%\n7,501\u00a0\n1,051\u00a0\n14.0\u00a0\n%\n8,373\u00a0\n1,166\u00a0\n13.9\u00a0\n%\nTotal United States\n15,383\u00a0\n2,218\u00a0\n14.4\u00a0\n%\n14,892\u00a0\n2,547\u00a0\n17.1\u00a0\n%\n17,499\u00a0\n2,887\u00a0\n16.5\u00a0\n%\nChina(a)\nSGMS\n1,277\u00a0\n1,407\u00a0\n1,482\u00a0\nSGMW\n1,615\u00a0\n1,494\u00a0\n1,612\u00a0\nTotal China\n25,878\u00a0\n2,892\u00a0\n11.2\u00a0\n%\n24,926\u00a0\n2,901\u00a0\n11.6\u00a0\n%\n25,398\u00a0\n3,094\u00a0\n12.2\u00a0\n%\n__________\n \n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Includes sales by our Automotive China Joint Ventures (Automotive China JVs): SAIC General Motors Sales Co., Ltd.

We sell vehicles directly or through our dealer network to fleet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies and governments. Certain fleet transactions, particularly sales to daily rental car companies, are generally less profitable than retail sales to end customers. The following table summarizes estimated fleet sales and those sales as a percentage of total vehicle sales (vehicles in thousands): \nYears Ended December 31,\n2021\n2020\n2019\nGMNA\n399\u00a0\n493\u00a0\n741\u00a0\nGMI\n311\u00a0\n351\u00a0\n498\u00a0\nTotal fleet sales\n710\u00a0\n844\u00a0\n1,239\u00a0\nFleet sales as a percentage of total vehicle sales\n11.3\u00a0\n%\n12.4\u00a0\n%\n16.1\u00a0\n%\nProduct Pricing  \nSeveral methods are used to promote our products, including the use of dealer, retail and fleet incentives, such as customer rebates and finance rate support. The level of incentives is dependent upon the level of competition in the markets in which we operate and the level of demand for our products. \nCyclical and Seasonal Nature of Business  \nThe market for vehicles is cyclical and depends in part on general economic conditions, credit availability and consumer spending. Vehicle markets are also seasonal. Production varies from month to month. Vehicle model changeovers occur throughout the year as a result of new market entries. \nRelationship with Dealers  \nWe market vehicles and automotive parts worldwide primarily through a network of independent authorized retail dealers. These outlets include distributors, dealers and authorized sales, service and parts outlets. Our customers can obtain a wide range of after-sale vehicle services and products through our dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties. The number of authorized dealerships and other agents performing similar functions were 4,670 in GMNA and 7,670 in GMI at December 31, 2021.\nWe and our joint ventures enter into a contract with each authorized dealer agreeing to sell to the dealer one or more specified product lines at wholesale prices and granting the dealer the right to sell those products to customers from an approved location. Our dealers often offer more than one GM brand at a single dealership in a number of our markets. Authorized dealers offer parts, accessories, service and repairs for GM vehicles in the product lines that they sell using GM parts and accessories. Our dealers are authorized to service GM vehicles under our limited warranty, and those repairs are made almost exclusively with GM parts. Our dealers generally provide their customers with access to credit or lease financing, vehicle insurance and extended service contracts, which may be provided by GM Financial and other financial institutions. \nThe quality of GM dealerships and our relationship with our dealers are critical to our success given that they maintain the primary sales and service interface with the end consumer of our products. In addition to the terms of our contracts with our dealers, we are regulated by various country and state franchise laws and regulations that may supersede those contractual terms and impose specific regulatory requirements and standards for initiating dealer network changes, pursuing terminations for cause and other contractual matters. \nResearch, Product Development and Intellectual Property  \nCosts for research, manufacturing engineering, product engineering and design and development activities primarily relate to developing new products or services or improving existing products or services, including activities related to vehicle and GHG emissions control, improved fuel economy, EVs, AVs and the safety of drivers and passengers. Research and development expenses were $7.9 billion, $6.2 billion and $6.8 billion in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. \nProduct Development  \nThe Global Product Development organization is responsible for designing, developing and integrating all global products and their components while aiming to maximize part sharing across multiple vehicle segments. Global teams in Design, Program Management & Execution, Component & Subsystem Engineering, Product Integrity, Safety, Controls and Software Engineering and Purchasing & Supply Chain collaborate to meet customer requirements and maximize global economies of scale.\nOur global vehicle architecture development is headquartered at our Global Technical Center in Warren, Michigan. Cross-segment part sharing is an essential enabler to optimize our vehicle portfolio, with more than 75% of our global internal combustion vehicle sales volume expected to come from five internal combustion vehicle architectures through this decade. We \n5\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nwill continue to leverage our architecture portfolio to accommodate our customers around the world while achieving our financial goals.\nWe invested in construction of the Wallace Battery Cell Innovation Center, an all-new facility that will significantly expand the Company's battery technology operations and accelerate development and commercialization of longer range, more affordable EV batteries. The Wallace Center will be located on the campus of the Global Technical Center in Warren, Michigan.\nIntellectual Property\n  We are constantly innovating and hold a significant number of patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property that protect those innovations in numerous countries. While no single piece of intellectual property is individually material to our business as a whole, our intellectual property is important to our operations and continued technological development. Additionally, we hold a number of trademarks and service marks that are very important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace.  \nRaw Materials, Services and Supplies\n  We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, parts, supplies, energy, freight, transportation and other services from numerous suppliers to manufacture our products. The raw materials primarily include steel, aluminum, resins, copper, lead and precious metals. We do not normally carry substantial inventories of these raw materials in excess of levels reasonably required to meet our production requirements, and we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials. Costs are expected to remain elevated due to the price of commodities and the continuing existence of tariffs. We also purchase systems, components and parts from suppliers. The global semiconductor supply shortage has had, and is continuing to have, wide-ranging effects across multiple industries, particularly the automotive industry. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors and to Part II, Item 7. MD&A for further discussion on the effect the global semiconductor supply shortage has had on our results of operations.\nIn some instances, we purchase systems, components, parts and supplies from a single source, which may increase risk to supply disruptions. The inability or unwillingness of these sources to provide us with parts and supplies could have a material adverse effect on our production. Combined purchases from our two largest suppliers were approximately 12% of total purchases in the year ended December 31, 2021, and approximately 11% of our total purchases in each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of these risks. \nOur transition to EVs includes a resilient, scalable and more sustainable North America-focused EV supply chain. Certain of the initiatives we have advanced in 2021 include sourcing silicon carbide power device solutions for GM\u2019s EV programs, processing cathode active material, sourcing U.S. lithium with more sustainable extraction methods and sourcing permanent magnets using locally sourced raw materials.\nAutomotive Financing - GM Financial  \nGM Financial is our global captive automotive finance company and our global provider of automobile finance solutions. GM Financial conducts its business in North America, South America and through joint ventures in China. \nGM Financial provides retail loan and lease lending across the credit spectrum to support vehicle sales. Additionally, GM Financial offers commercial lending products to dealers including floorplan financing, which is lending to finance new and used vehicle inventory; and dealer loans, which are loans to finance improvements to dealership facilities, to provide working capital, or to purchase and/or finance dealership real estate. Other commercial lending products include financing for parts and accessories, dealer fleets and storage centers.\nIn North America, GM Financial offers a sub-prime lending program. The program is primarily offered to consumers with a FICO score or its equivalent of less than 620 who have limited access to automobile financing through banks and credit unions and is expected to sustain a higher level of credit losses than prime lending. \nGM Financial generally seeks to fund its operations in each country through local sources of funding to minimize currency and country risk. GM Financial primarily finances its loan, lease and commercial origination volume through the use of secured and unsecured credit facilities, securitization transactions and the issuance of unsecured debt in the capital markets.\n6\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nHuman Capital\n \nThe foundation of GM\u2019s business is our Purpose: We pioneer the innovations that move and connect people to what matters. It's why we exist. Our Purpose, growth strategy and culture all help us on our path towards achieving our vision of \u2014 a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion. Our people are our most valuable asset, and we must continue to attract and retain the best talent in the world in order to achieve this vision. As a result, we strive to create a Workplace of Choice to attract, retain and develop top talent by adhering to a responsible employer philosophy, which includes, among other things, commitments to create job opportunities, pay workers fairly, ensure safety and well-being, and promote diversity, equity and inclusion. Fundamental to these commitments are our company values.\n \n Our eight GM behaviors are the foundation of our culture; and how we behave\u202fencompasses key measures of our performance, including the visible ways we conduct ourselves as we work with one another.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\n  At GM, we are committed to fostering a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion. In every moment, we must decide what we can do \u2014 individually and collectively \u2014 to drive meaningful, deliberate and long-lasting change. GM\u2019s unwavering commitment in this regard includes taking steps to ensure that all areas of our business are \n7\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nsupportive of a world-class inclusive, equitable and diverse organization. Our ability to meet the needs of a diverse and global customer base is tied closely to the behaviors of the people within our company, which is why we are committed to fostering a culture that celebrates our differences. This commitment is embraced at all levels of the organization, including our diverse Board of Directors, which is currently made up of more than 50% women (7 out of 13 members) and is more than 30% racially or ethnically diverse (4 out of 13 members). In alignment with these commitments, GM publicly disclosed its EEO-1 Consolidated Report for the first time in 2021. \nBased on these longstanding values, our Chair and CEO, Mary Barra, chairs an Inclusion Advisory Board (IAB) of internal and external leaders who guide our work to improve diversity and inclusion in our Company. The purpose of the IAB is to consult with GM\u2019s Senior Leadership Team with the long-term goal of inspiring the Company to be inclusive through our words, deeds and culture. We also have a number of programs and partnerships aimed at enhancing our culture of inclusion throughout the Company. For example, we have 11 voluntary, employee-led resource groups that provide a forum for diverse employees and allies from a variety of different backgrounds to share experiences and express concerns. Each group also works to attract new talent to our company and offers employees opportunities to support our company\u2019s diversity initiatives within the community.\nIn addition, we are expanding our partnerships with organizations aimed at supporting our ongoing efforts to increase the representation of women and underrepresented groups in our workplace. Through our participation in the Business Roundtable Multiple Pathways Initiative and OneTen, for example, we are specifically aiming to build more robust pipelines for skills-based hiring into our company while ensuring long-term developmental opportunity. \nDevelop and Retain Talented People \n Today, we compete for talent against other automotive companies and against businesses in other sectors, such as technology. To win and keep top talent, we must provide a workplace culture that encourages employee behaviors aligned with our values, fulfills their long-term individual aspirations and provides experiences that make individuals feel valued, included and engaged. In furtherance of this goal, we invest significant resources to retain and develop our talent. In addition to mentoring and networking opportunities, we offer a vast array of career development resources to help develop, grow and enable employees to make the most of their careers at GM. Formal resources include, among other things, the Technical Education Program, which offers our employees an opportunity to complete corporate strategically aligned degrees and certificate programs at leading universities, and our Degreed Learning Platform, which brings forth a variety of external and in-house content in learning pathways and other micro learnings. It is also tied to our GM Competency and skills model. Employees in some of our technical roles also have the opportunity to participate in the GM Technical Learning University \u2014 a training and upskilling program designed to expand and update the technical prowess of our workforce.\nGM recognizes that leadership effectiveness is a critical business need. All new managers in the Company are automatically entered into a six-month immersive learning program and all new executives come together annually for a week-long upskilling and targeted development program designed around the GM leadership profile.\nSafety and Well-Being\n  The safety and well-being of our employees is also a critical component of our ability to transform the future of personal mobility. At GM, we pride ourselves on our commitment to live values that return people home safely \u2014 Every Person, Every Site, Every Day. Our unwavering commitment to safety is manifested through empowering employees to \u201cSpeak Up for Safety\u201d through various means without fear of retaliation. The well-being of our employees is equally as important to entice and stimulate creativity and innovation. In addition to traditional healthcare, paid time off, paid parental leave, wellness programs, flextime scheduling and telecommuting arrangements and retirement benefits, including a 401(k) matching program, GM offers a variety of benefits and resources to support employees' physical and mental health, including access to fitness facilities in certain locations, which help us both attract talent and reap the benefits of a healthier workforce. In addition, leveraging our experience with remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic, GM recently instituted \u201cWork Appropriately,\u201d a policy whereby, depending on the nature of their work, our employees have the flexibility to work where they can have the greatest impact to achieve their goals and for their individual success. \n8\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nEmployees  \nAt December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 83,000 (53%) hourly employees and approximately 74,000 (47%) salaried employees.

Each of the officers named above was elected by the Board of Directors to hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal. \nEnvironmental and Regulatory Matters\nAutomotive Criteria Emissions Control  \nOur products are subject to laws and regulations globally that require us to control certain non-GHG automotive emissions, including vehicle and engine exhaust emission standards, vehicle evaporative emission standards and onboard diagnostic (OBD) system requirements. Emission requirements have become more stringent as a result of stricter standards and new diagnostic requirements that have come into force in many markets around the world, often with very little harmonization. Regulatory authorities may conduct ongoing evaluations of products from all manufacturers. For additional information, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n9\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe U.S. federal government, through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), imposes stringent exhaust and evaporative emission control requirements on vehicles sold in the U.S. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) likewise imposes stringent exhaust and evaporative emission standards. The Clean Air Act permits states that have areas with air quality compliance issues to adopt California emission standards in lieu of federal requirements. Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have adopted California emission standards, and there is a possibility that additional U.S. jurisdictions could adopt California emission requirements in the future.\nFor each model year we must obtain certification that our vehicles and heavy-duty engines will meet emission requirements of the EPA before we can sell vehicles in the U.S. and Canada, and of CARB before we can sell vehicles in California and the states that have adopted California emission requirements.\nThe Canadian federal government's current vehicle pollutant emission requirements are generally aligned with U.S. federal requirements. \nIn 2019, certain areas within China began implementation of the China 6 emission standard (China 6) requirements. China 6 combines elements of both European Union (EU) and U.S. standards and increases the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicle's emission performance. Nationwide implementation of China 6a for new registrations occurred in January 2021, and the more stringent China 6b is expected to be implemented in July 2023. \nBrazil has approved a set of national emission standards referred to as L7, to be implemented in 2022, and L8, to be implemented from 2025 onward. L7 standards cover tailpipe exhaust gases, durability for emissions, evaporative emissions and noise limits, and include additional OBD requirements and a phase-in for onboard refueling vapor recovery systems. L8 standards include targets for vehicle emissions and reduce corporate exhaust limits every two years until 2031. Some of the requirements are aligned with those of the EPA.  \nAs a result of the sale of the Opel and Vauxhall businesses and certain other assets in Europe (Opel/Vauxhall Business), GM\u2019s vehicle presence in Europe is smaller, but GM may still be affected by actions taken by regulators related both to Opel/Vauxhall vehicles sold before the sale of the Opel/Vauxhall Business as well as to other vehicles GM continues to sell in Europe. In the EU, increased scrutiny of compliance with emission standards may result in changes to these standards, as well as stricter interpretations or redefinition of these standards and more rigorous enforcement. For example, our former German subsidiary has participated in continuing discussions with German and European authorities concerning emissions control systems. Beyond this, as a part of the EU\u2019s desire to accelerate the shift to sustainable mobility, the EU is looking to develop stricter emission standards (Euro 7) for all petrol and diesel cars, vans, lorries and buses, as well as reform CO2 standards, and place requirements on batteries to be used in EVs. For additional information, refer to Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.\nAutomotive Fuel Economy and GHG Emissions\n \nIn the U.S., NHTSA promulgates and enforces Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for three separate fleets: domestic cars, import cars and light-duty trucks. Manufacturers are subject to substantial civil penalties if they fail to meet the applicable CAFE standard in any model year, after considering all available credits for the preceding five model years, expected credits for the three succeeding model years and credits obtained from other manufacturers. In addition to federal CAFE standards, the EPA promulgates and enforces GHG emission standards. In March 2020, NHTSA and the EPA issued a rule setting fuel economy and GHG emission standards for light-duty vehicles through the 2026 model year. Those actions are currently being challenged through litigation; however, the litigation is currently held in abeyance as the agencies have since proposed new, more stringent light-duty CAFE and GHG standards. Though NHTSA and the EPA have previously issued joint CAFE and GHG standards, the agencies have now separately proposed, and the EPA has finalized, standards with differing stringency levels and affected model years, with the proposed CAFE standards addressing the 2024-2026 model years and the GHG standards addressing the 2023-2026 model years. NHTSA and the EPA also regulate the fuel efficiency and GHG emissions of medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, imposing more stringent standards over time.\nIn addition, CARB has asserted the right to promulgate and enforce its own state GHG standards for motor vehicles, and other states have asserted the right to adopt CARB's standards. CARB regulations previously stated that compliance with the light-duty EPA GHG program is deemed compliance with CARB standards. However, in December 2018 CARB amended this regulation to state that, in the event the EPA were to alter federal GHG stringency, which it now has, compliance with the EPA's GHG emission standards will no longer be deemed compliance with CARB's separate requirements. In September 2019, NHTSA issued a rule asserting that California is preempted from regulating GHG emissions. Litigation challenging that rule is currently being held in abeyance, as the EPA has since proposed, and NHTSA has finalized, actions that could result in a restoration of California\u2019s ability to promulgate and enforce its own state GHG standards. Depending on the outcome of the \n10\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nfederal CAFE and GHG rulemakings and related litigation and the finality of CARB's regulatory amendment, in the future GM might be required to meet differing EPA GHG, California GHG and CAFE standards.\nCARB has also imposed the requirement that increasing percentages of Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEVs) must be sold in California. The Clean Air Act permits states to adopt California emission standards, and 14 have adopted the ZEV requirements. In September 2019, the EPA revoked the waiver it had granted to California that permitted its ZEV program, and NHTSA also asserted preemption of California's ZEV program. Litigation over EPA and NHTSA's actions is currently being held in abeyance, as EPA and NHTSA have since proposed actions that could result in a restoration of California\u2019s ability to promulgate and enforce ZEV standards. Depending on any final agency action taken by the EPA and NHTSA, and/or the outcome of the related litigation, there is a possibility that additional U.S. jurisdictions could adopt California ZEV requirements in the future.\nIn Canada, light- and heavy-duty GHG regulations are currently patterned after the EPA GHG emission standards given the integrated nature of the auto sector between Canada and the United States. The Canadian government is conducting a mid-term review of its 2022 to 2025 model year light-duty GHG standards and is considering regulatory developments of the U.S. in this regard. In addition, the Canadian province of Quebec has ZEV requirements regulating the 2018 to 2025 model years largely based on California program requirements and the province of British Columbia\u2019s similar ZEV regulations that were completed in July 2020 and cover the 2020 to 2039 model years. Both provinces are further updating their ZEV regulations and the Canadian federal government recently proposed to ban the sale of ICE vehicles in Canada beginning in 2035, although no specific draft regulations have been shared at this time.\nChina has two fuel economy requirements for passenger vehicles: an individual vehicle pass-fail type approval requirement and a fleet average fuel consumption requirement. With a focus on the fleet average fuel consumption requirement, the China Phase 5 launched in 2021 and full compliance is required by 2025. In addition, China has established a mandate that requires passenger car manufacturers to produce a certain volume of plug-in hybrid, battery electric and fuel cell vehicles, which are referred to as New Energy Vehicles (NEVs), to generate credits in 2019 and beyond. The number of credits per car is based on the level of electric range and energy efficiency, with the goal of increasing NEV volume penetrations and improving technological sophistication over time. Uncommitted NEV credits may be used to assist compliance with the fleet average fuel consumption requirement. China has issued NEV credit targets between 2019 and 2023 and is setting new NEV credit targets aimed at further increasing volumes of NEVs in 2024 and 2025. China has provided various levels of subsidies for NEVs, and certain subsidies have been extended to the end of 2022. \nIn Brazil, the Secretary of Industry and Development promulgates and enforces CAFE standards and has enforced a new CAFE program for the period October 2020 to September 2026 and October 2026 to September 2032 for light-duty and mid-size trucks and SUVs, including diesel vehicles, imposing more stringent standards for each period. \nWe have several options to comply with existing and potential new global regulations. Such options include increasing production and sale of certain vehicles, such as EVs, and curtailing production of less fuel efficient ICE vehicles; technology changes, including fuel consumption efficiency and engine upgrades; payment of penalties; and/or purchase of credits from third parties. We regularly evaluate our current and future product plans and strategies for compliance with fuel economy and GHG regulations.\n We plan to be carbon neutral by 2040 in our global products and operations, supported by a commitment to science-based targets. In addition, the Company announced our vision of an all-electric future and our plan to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new light-duty vehicles by 2035. These targets align with our growth and transformation plan including our commitment to an all-electric future, which will be enabled by our Ultium platform and HYDROTEC technology as previously detailed. We also announced, in June 2021, our plans to increase our investment in EVs and AVs to more than $35.0\u00a0billion through 2025 to accelerate this transformation plan.\nIndustrial Environmental Control\n \nOur operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws including those regulating air emissions, water discharge, waste management and environmental cleanup. Certain environmental statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. Under certain circumstances these laws impose joint and several liability as well as liability for related damages to natural resources. \nTo mitigate the effects of our worldwide operations on the environment, including climate change, we are embracing sustainability programs focused on reducing operational GHG emissions, water consumption and discharge and waste disposal. \n11\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIn 2021, we launched our new global GM Zero Waste program, with a goal to divert waste from landfills and incinerators. For the year ended December 31, 2021, GM's facilities included in the global GM Zero Waste program diverted over 1.1 million metric tons of waste from landfills and incinerators through composting, reusing and recycling.\nIn addition to reducing our impact on the environment, our waste reduction commitments generate income from the sale of production by-products, reduce our use of raw materials and help to reduce the risks and financial liabilities associated with waste disposal.\nWe continue our efforts to increase our use of renewable energy, improve our energy efficiency and work to drive growth and scale of renewables. To that end, we have set a goal of meeting the electricity needs of our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025 in the U.S., a goal we recently accelerated from 2030, and by 2035 globally.\nThrough December 31, 2021, we implemented projects and signed renewable energy contracts globally that brought our total renewable energy capacity to over one gigawatt by 2023, which represents approximately 75% of our U.S. electricity use and approximately 40% of our global electricity use. In 2019 and 2020, we executed two of our largest green tariffs to date with DTE Energy Company, sourcing 840,000 megawatt hours of renewable energy that began supplying us in early 2021 in phase 1 with the remainder expected in mid-2023 in phase 2. Additionally, in 2020 we executed our largest power purchase agreement to date, with 180 megawatts of solar electricity supplying our U.S. operations starting in 2023. We continue to seek opportunities for a diversified renewable energy portfolio including wind, solar and landfill gas, including executing a 28 megawatts solar green tariff with TVA to supply our Bowling Green Assembly Plant. In 2021, Energy Star certified two assembly plants and four buildings in the U.S. for superior energy management. We also met the EPA Energy Star Challenge for Industry (EPA Challenge) at five additional sites by reducing energy intensity an average of 15% at these sites within two years. To meet the EPA Challenge, industrial sites must reduce energy intensity by 10% within a five year period. In total, 69 GM-owned manufacturing sites have met the EPA Challenge, with many sites achieving the goal multiple times for a total of 132 recognitions. Additionally, we received recognition from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) of 50001 Ready status for 25 facilities. The U.S. DOE 50001 Ready program is a self-guided approach for facilities to establish an energy management system and self-attest to the structure of ISO 50001, a voluntary global standard for energy management systems in industrial, commercial and institutional facilities. These sustainability efforts reduce our operational expenses and are part of our approach to improve the sustainability of our operations by aligning our business strategy with aggressive environmental goals and reduction targets, collecting accurate data, and publicly reporting progress against our targets. \n \nChemical Regulations  \nWe continually monitor the implementation of chemical regulations to maintain compliance and evaluate their effect on our business, suppliers and the automotive industry.\nGlobally, governments continue to introduce new legislation and regulations related to the selection and use of chemicals by mandating broad prohibitions or restrictions and implementing vehicle interior air quality, green chemistry, life cycle analysis and product stewardship initiatives. These initiatives give broad regulatory authority to ban or restrict the use of certain chemical substances and potentially affect automobile manufacturers' responsibilities for vehicle components at the end of a vehicle's life, as well as chemical selection for product development and manufacturing. Global treaties and initiatives such as the Stockholm, Basel and Rotterdam Conventions on Chemicals and Waste and the Minamata Convention on Mercury, are driving chemical regulations across signatory countries. Increases in the use of circuit boards and other electronics may require additional assessment under the Restriction on Hazardous Substances and Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment directives. New European requirements require suppliers of parts and vehicles to the European market to disclose Substances of Concern in Parts.  \nChemical regulations are increasing in North America. In the U.S., the EPA is moving forward with risk analysis and management of high priority chemicals under the authority of the 2016 Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act. In addition, several U.S. states have chemical management regulations that can affect vehicle design and manufacturing such as chemical restriction and use requirements. Chemical restrictions and export controls in Canada continue to steadily progress under the Environment and Climate Change Canada's Chemical Management Plan to assess existing substances and implement risk management controls on any chemical deemed toxic. \nThese emerging laws and regulations will potentially lead to increases in costs and supply chain complexity. Manufacturers, including joint venture partners and suppliers, that do not comply with global and specific country regulations could be subject to civil penalties, production disruptions, or limitations on the sale of affected products. We believe we are materially in compliance with substantially all these requirements or expect to be materially in compliance by the required dates.\n12\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nVehicle Safety\n \nU.S. Requirements\n  The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the Safety Act) regulates the vehicles and items of motor vehicle equipment that we manufacture and sell. The Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards established by NHTSA. Meeting or exceeding the many safety standards is costly as global compliance and non-governmental assessment requirements continue to evolve and grow more complex, and lack harmonization globally. The Safety Act further requires that if we or NHTSA determine a vehicle or an item of vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard, or that vehicle or equipment contains a defect that poses an unreasonable safety risk, we must conduct a safety recall to remedy that condition in the affected vehicles. Should we or NHTSA determine a safety defect or noncompliance issue exists with respect to any of our vehicles, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial. \nOther National Requirements\n  Outside of the U.S., many countries have established vehicle safety standards and regulations and are likely to adopt additional, more stringent requirements in the future. The European General Safety Regulation has introduced United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN-ECE) regulations, which are required for the European Type Approval process. Globally, governments generally have been adopting UN-ECE based regulations with some variations to address local concerns. Any difference between North American and UN-ECE based regulations can add complexity and costs to vehicle development, and we continue to support efforts to harmonize regulations to reduce complexity. New safety and recall requirements in various countries around the world, including in China, Brazil, and Gulf Cooperation Council countries, also may add substantial costs and complexity to our safety and field action activities globally. In Canada, vehicle regulatory requirements are currently aligned with U.S. regulations; however, under the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Act, recall thresholds are different and the Minister of Transport has broad powers to order manufacturers to submit a notice of defect or non-compliance when the Minister considers it to be in the interest of safety. Further, various governments are beginning to mandate e-Call and other features that can be market-specific and add complexity and increase our cost of compliance globally.  \nCrash Test Ratings and New Car Assessment Programs\n  Organizations in various regions around the world, including in the U.S., rate and compare motor vehicles through various New Car Assessment Programs (NCAPs) to provide consumers and businesses with additional information about the safety of new vehicles. NCAPs use crash tests and other evaluations that are different than what is required by applicable regulations, and use stars to rate vehicle safety, with five stars awarded for the highest rating and one for the lowest. Achieving high NCAP ratings, which can vary by country and region, can add complexity and cost to vehicles.  \nWebsite Access to Our Reports  \nOur internet website address is https://www.gm.com.

Risk Factors\nWe have listed below the most material risk factors applicable to us. These risk factors are not necessarily in the order of importance or probability of occurrence:\nRisks related to our competition and strategy\nIf we do not deliver new products, services, technologies and customer experiences in response to increased competition and changing consumer preferences in the automotive industry, our business could suffer. \n \nWe believe that the automotive industry will continue to experience significant change in the coming years, particularly as traditional automotive original equipment manufacturers shift resources to the development of EVs. In addition to our traditional competitors, we must also be responsive to the entrance of start-ups and other non-traditional competitors in the automotive industry. These new competitors, as well as established industry participants, are disrupting the historic business model of our industry through the introduction of new technologies, products, services, direct-to-consumer sales channels, methods of transportation and vehicle ownership. To successfully execute our long-term strategy, we must continue to develop new products and services, including products and services that are outside of our historically core ICE business, such as EVs and AVs, software-enabled connected services and other new businesses.  \nOur vehicles and connected services increasingly rely on software and hardware that is highly technical and complex. The process of designing and developing new technology, products and services is costly and uncertain and requires extensive capital investment and the ability to retain and recruit the best talent. If our access to capital were to become significantly constrained, if costs of capital increased significantly, or if our ability to raise capital is challenged relative to our peers, in each case including as a result of any constraints on lending due to concerns about climate change, our ability to execute on our strategic plans could be adversely affected. Further, the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and diverse employees could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our strategic plans.\nThere can be no assurance that advances in technology will occur in a timely or feasible way, if at all, that others will not acquire similar or superior technologies sooner than we do, or that we will acquire technologies on an exclusive basis or at a significant price advantage. Further, if we are unable to prevent or effectively remedy errors, bugs, vulnerabilities or defects in our software and hardware, or fail to deploy updates to our software properly, or if we do not adequately prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations, market developments and changing customer needs, our sales, profitability and long-term competitiveness may be harmed.\nOur ability to maintain profitability is dependent upon our ability to timely fund and introduce new and improved vehicle models, including EVs, that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers.\n \nWe operate in a very competitive industry with market participants routinely introducing new and improved vehicle models and features designed to meet rapidly evolving consumer expectations. Producing new and improved vehicle models, including EVs, that preserve our reputation for designing, building and selling safe, high-quality cars, trucks and SUVs is critical to our long-term profitability. Successful launches of our new vehicles are critical to our short-term profitability. The new vehicle development process can take two years or more, and a number of factors may lengthen that time period. Because of this product development cycle and the various elements that may contribute to consumers\u2019 acceptance of new vehicle designs, including competitors\u2019 product introductions, technological innovations, fuel prices, general economic conditions, regulatory developments, transportation infrastructure and changes in quality, safety, reliability and styling demands and preferences, an initial product concept or design may not result in a saleable vehicle or a vehicle that generates sales in sufficient quantities and at high enough prices to be profitable. Our high proportion of fixed costs, both due to our significant investment in property, plant and equipment as well as other requirements of our collective bargaining agreements, which limit our flexibility to adjust personnel costs to changes in demands for our products, may further exacerbate the risks associated with incorrectly assessing demand for our vehicles.\nOur long-term strategy is dependent upon our ability to profitably deliver a broad portfolio of EVs.\n \nThe production and profitable sale of EVs has become increasingly important to our long-term business as we accelerate our transition to an all-electric future. In 2021, we increased our commitment to investments in EV and AV technologies to more than $35.0\u00a0billion from 2020 through 2025, with plans to launch more than 30 new EV models globally across several price points in that timeframe. Our EV strategy is dependent on our ability to deliver a broad portfolio of high-quality EVs that are competitive and meet consumer demands; reduce the costs associated with the manufacture of EVs, particularly with respect to batteries; increase vehicle range and the energy density of our batteries; license and monetize our proprietary platforms and related innovations; successfully invest in new technologies relative to our peers; develop new software and services; and leverage our scale, manufacturing capabilities and synergies with existing ICE vehicles. \n14\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIn addition, consumer adoption of EVs will be critical to the success of our strategy. Consumer adoption of EVs could be impacted by numerous factors, including the breadth of the portfolio of EVs available; perceptions about EV features, quality, safety, performance and cost relative to ICE vehicles; the range over which EVs may be driven on a full battery charge; the proliferation of charging infrastructure, in particular with respect to public EV charging stations; cost and availability of high fuel-economy ICE vehicles; volatility, or a sustained decrease, in the cost of petroleum-based fuel; failure by governments and other third parties to make the investments necessary to make infrastructure improvements, such as greater availability of cleaner energy grids and EV charging stations, and to provide economic incentives promoting the adoption of EVs; and negative feedback from stakeholders impacting investor and consumer confidence in our company or industry. If we are unable to successfully deliver on our EV strategy, it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects, and could negatively impact our brand and reputation.\nOur near-term profitability is dependent upon the success of our current line of full-size ICE SUVs and full-size ICE pickup trucks.\n \nWhile we offer a broad portfolio of cars, crossovers, SUVs and trucks, and we have announced significant plans to design, build and sell a broad portfolio of EVs, we currently recognize higher profit margins on our full-size ICE SUVs and full-size ICE trucks. Our near-term success is dependent upon our ability to sell higher margin vehicles in sufficient volumes. We also plan to use the cash generated by our ICE vehicles to fund our growth strategy, including the development and sale of EVs and AVs. Any near-term shift in consumer preferences toward smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, whether as a result of increases in the price of oil or any sustained shortage of oil, including as a result of global political instability, concerns about climate change, including any constraints related to lending on GHG-emitting products, or other reasons, could weaken the demand for our higher margin vehicles. More stringent fuel economy regulations could also impact our ability to sell these vehicles or could result in additional costs associated with these vehicles. See \u201cOur operations and products are subject to extensive laws, regulations and policies, including those related to vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards, which can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do business.\u201d\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry that has historically had excess manufacturing capacity, and attempts by our competitors to sell more vehicles could have a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing, market share and operating results.\n \nThe global automotive industry is highly competitive in terms of the quality, innovation, new technologies, pricing, fuel economy, reliability, safety, customer service and financial services offered. Additionally, overall manufacturing capacity in the industry has historically far exceeded demand. In addition, we have made, and plan to continue to make, significant investments in EV manufacturing capacity based on our expectations for EV demand, which is subject to various risks and uncertainties as described above. Many manufacturers, including GM, have relatively high fixed labor costs as well as limitations on their ability to close facilities and reduce fixed costs, often as a result of collective bargaining agreements. In light of any excess capacity and high fixed costs, many industry participants have attempted to sell more vehicles by providing subsidized financing or leasing programs, offering marketing incentives or reducing vehicle prices. As a result, we may be required to offer similar incentives that may result in vehicle prices that do not offset our costs, including any cost increases or the impact of adverse currency fluctuations, which could affect our profitability. Our competitors may also seek to benefit from economies of scale by consolidating or entering into other strategic agreements such as alliances or joint ventures intended to enhance their competitiveness.\nManufacturers in countries that have lower production costs, such as China and India, have become competitors in key emerging markets and have announced their intention to export their products to established markets as a low-cost alternative to established entry-level automobiles. In addition, foreign governments may decide to implement tax and other policies that favor their domestic manufacturers at the expense of international manufacturers, including GM and its joint venture partners. These actions have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing, market share and operating results in these markets.\nOur AV strategy is dependent upon our ability to successfully mitigate unique technological, operational and regulatory risks.  \nGM Cruise Holdings LLC (Cruise Holdings), our majority-owned subsidiary, is responsible for the development and commercialization of AV technology. Our AV operations are capital intensive and subject to a variety of risks inherent with the development of new technologies, including our ability to continue to develop self-driving software and hardware, such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors and other components; access to sufficient capital; risks related to the manufacture of purpose-built AVs; and significant competition from both established automotive companies and technology companies, some of which may have more resources and capital to devote to AV technologies than we do. In addition, we face risks related to the commercial deployment of AVs on our targeted timeline or at all, including consumer acceptance, achievement of adequate safety and other performance standards and compliance with uncertain, evolving and potentially conflicting federal and state or provincial regulations. To the extent accidents, cybersecurity breaches or other adverse events associated with our autonomous driving systems occur, we could be subject to liability, reputational harm, government scrutiny and further regulation, and it could deter consumer adoption of AV technology. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.\n15\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe are subject to risks associated with climate change, including increased regulation of GHG emissions, changing consumer preferences and other risks related to our transition to EVs and the potential increased impacts of severe weather events on our operations and infrastructure.  \nIncreasing attention to climate change, increasing societal expectations on companies to address climate change and changes in consumer preferences may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our products, reduced profits, risks associated with new regulatory requirements and the potential for increased litigation and governmental investigations. Climate change regulations at the federal, state or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to further limit emissions associated with customer use of products we sell, change our manufacturing processes or product portfolio or undertake other activities that may require us to incur additional expense, which may be material. These requirements may increase the cost of, and/or diminish demand for, our ICE vehicles. See \u201cOur operations and products are subject to extensive laws, regulations and policies, including those related to vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards, which can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do business.\u201d\nPart of our strategy to address these risks includes our transition to EVs, which presents additional risks, including reduced demand for, and therefore profits from, our ICE vehicles, which we plan to use to fund our growth strategy; higher costs related to EV technologies impacting profitability compared to ICE vehicles; and risks related to the success of our EV strategy. See \u201cOur long-term strategy is dependent upon our ability to profitably deliver a broad portfolio of EVs\u201d and \u201cOur near-term profitability is dependent upon the success of our current line of full-size ICE SUVs and full-size ICE pickup trucks.\u201d\nFinally, increased intensity, frequency or duration of storms, droughts or other severe weather events as a result of climate change may disrupt our production and the production, logistics, cost and procurement of products from our suppliers and timely delivery of vehicles to customers, and could negatively impact working conditions at our plants and those of our suppliers. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks related to our operations\nOur business is highly dependent upon global automobile market sales volume, which can be volatile. \n Because we have a high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs, small changes in sales volume can have a disproportionately large effect on our profitability. A number of economic and market conditions drive changes in new vehicle sales, including disruptions in the new vehicle supply chain, the availability and prices of used vehicles, levels of unemployment and inflation, availability of affordable financing, fluctuations in the cost of fuel, consumer confidence and demand for vehicles, political unrest or uncertainty, the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, including COVID-19, barriers to trade and other global economic conditions. For a discussion of economic and market trends, see the \"Overview\" section in Part II, Item 7. MD&A. Any significant decrease in new vehicle sales could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nHigh prices and uncertain availability of commodities, raw materials or other inputs used by us and our suppliers, or instability in logistics and related costs, could negatively impact our profitability.  \nIncreases in prices for commodities, raw materials or other inputs that we and our suppliers use in manufacturing products, systems, components and parts, such as steel, precious metals, non-ferrous metals, critical minerals or other similar raw materials, or increases in logistics and related costs, may lead to higher production costs for parts, components and vehicles. In addition, any increase in the cost of critical materials for our EV propulsion systems, including lithium, nickel, cobalt and certain rare earth metals, could lead to higher production costs for our EVs and could impede our ability to successfully deliver on our EV strategy. Further, increasing global demand for, and uncertain supply of, such materials could disrupt our or our suppliers\u2019 ability to obtain such materials in a timely manner and/or could lead to increased costs. Geopolitical risk, fluctuations in supply and demand, any weakening of the U.S. dollar and other economic and political factors may continue to create pricing pressure for commodities, raw materials and other inputs. These inflationary pressures could, in turn, negatively impact our future profitability because we may not be able to pass all of those costs on to our customers or require our suppliers to absorb such costs.\nOur business in China subjects us to unique operational, competitive and regulatory risks.\n \nPursuing opportunities in the Chinese market is an important component of our global growth strategy. Our business in China is subject to aggressive competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous domestic manufacturers as well as non-traditional market participants, such as domestic technology companies. In addition, our success in China depends upon our ability to adequately address unique market and consumer preferences driven by advancements related to EVs, infotainment, software-enabled connected services and other new technologies. Our ability to fully deploy our technologies in China may be impacted by evolving laws and regulations in the U.S. and China. Increased competition, continued U.S.-China trade tensions or weakening economic conditions in China, among other factors, may result in cost increases, price reductions, reduced sales, profitability and margins, and challenges to gaining or holding market share. \nCertain risks and uncertainties of doing business in China are solely within the control of the Chinese government, and Chinese law regulates the scope of our investments and business conducted within China. In order to maintain access to the Chinese market, we may be required to comply with significant technical and other regulatory requirements that are unique to the Chinese market, at times with challenging lead times. These actions may increase the cost of doing business in China or \n16\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nlimit how and under what conditions we may do business in China, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\nWe benefit from many ongoing strategic business relationships, and a significant amount of our operations are conducted by joint ventures, which we cannot operate solely for our benefit.  \nWe are engaged in many strategic business relationships, and we expect that such arrangements will continue to be an important factor in the growth and success of our business, particularly in light of industry consolidation. However, there are no assurances that we will be able to identify or secure suitable business relationships in the future or that our competitors will not capitalize on such opportunities before we do, or that any strategic business relationships that we enter into will be successful. If we are unable to successfully source and execute on strategic business relationships in the future, our overall growth could be impaired, and our business, prospects and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. \nIn addition, many of our operations, primarily in China and Korea as well as our battery manufacturing operations with LG Energy Solution, are carried out by joint ventures. In joint ventures we share ownership and management of a company with one or more parties who may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do and may compete with us outside the joint venture. Joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Operating a business as a joint venture often requires additional organizational formalities as well as time-consuming procedures for sharing information and making decisions that must further take into consideration our partners' interests. In joint ventures we are required to foster our relationships with our co-owners as well as promote the overall success of the joint venture, and if a co-owner changes, relationships deteriorate or strategic objectives diverge, our success in the joint venture may be materially adversely affected. Further, the benefits from a successful joint venture are shared among the co-owners, therefore we do not receive all the benefits from our successful joint ventures.\nIn addition, because we share ownership and management with one or more parties, we may have limited control over the actions of a joint venture, particularly when we own a minority interest. As a result, we may be unable to prevent violations of applicable laws or other misconduct by a joint venture or the failure to satisfy contractual obligations by one or more parties. Moreover, a joint venture may not follow the same requirements regarding compliance, internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow. To the extent another party makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control issues arise within the joint venture, we may have to take responsive actions, or we may be subject to penalties, fines or other punitive actions for these activities.\nThe international scale and footprint of our operations expose us to additional risks.\n \nWe manufacture, sell and service products globally and rely upon an integrated global supply chain to deliver the raw materials, components, systems and parts that we need to manufacture our products. Our global operations subject us to extensive domestic and foreign legal and regulatory requirements, and a variety of other political, economic and regulatory risks, including: (1) changes in government leadership; (2) changes in trade compliance, labor, employment, tax, privacy, environmental and other laws, regulations or government policies impacting our overall business model or practices or restricting our ability to manufacture, purchase or sell products consistent with market demand and our business objectives; (3) political pressures to change any aspect of our business model or practices or that impair our ability to source raw materials, services, components, systems and parts, or manufacture products on competitive terms in a manner consistent with our business objectives; (4) political uncertainty, instability, civil unrest or government controls over certain sectors; (5) political and economic tensions between governments and changes in international economic policies, including restrictions on the repatriation of dividends or in the export of technology, especially between China and the U.S.; (6) changes to customs requirements or procedures (e.g., inspections) or new or higher tariffs, for example, on products imported into or exported from the U.S., including under U.S. or other trade laws or measures; (7) new non-tariff barriers to entry or domestic preference procurement requirements, or enforcement of, changes to, withdrawals from or impediments to implementing free trade agreements (for example, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement), or preferences of foreign nationals for domestically manufactured products; (8) changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly in Brazil and Argentina, and interest rates; (9) economic downturns or significant changes in conditions in the countries in which we operate; (10) differing local product preferences and product requirements, including government certification requirements related to, among other things, fuel economy, vehicle emissions, EVs and AVs, connected services and safety; (11) impact of changes to and compliance with U.S. and foreign countries\u2019 export controls, economic sanctions and other similar measures; (12) liabilities resulting from U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, those related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and certain other anti-corruption laws; (13) differing labor regulations, agreements, requirements and union relationships; (14) differing dealer and franchise regulations and relationships; (15) difficulties in obtaining financing in foreign countries for local operations; and (16) natural disasters, public health crises, including the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, such as COVID-19, and other catastrophic events.\nAny significant disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could disrupt our production schedule.\n \nWe assemble vehicles at various facilities around the world. Our facilities are typically designed to produce particular models for particular geographic markets. No single facility is designed to manufacture our full range of vehicles. In some cases, certain facilities produce products, systems, components and parts that disproportionately contribute a greater degree to our profitability than \n17\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nothers and create significant interdependencies among manufacturing facilities around the world. Should these or other facilities become unavailable either temporarily or permanently for any number of reasons, including labor disruptions, supply chain disruptions, the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, such as COVID-19, or catastrophic weather events, whether or not as a result of climate change, the inability to manufacture at the affected facility may result in harm to our reputation, increased costs, lower revenues and the loss of customers. In particular, substantially all of our hourly employees are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements that must be negotiated from time-to-time, including at the local facility level, which increases our risk of work stoppages. We may not be able to easily shift production to other facilities or to make up for lost production. Any new facility needed to replace an inoperable manufacturing facility would need to comply with the necessary regulatory requirements, need to satisfy our specialized manufacturing requirements and require specialized equipment.\nAny disruption in our suppliers\u2019 operations could disrupt our production schedule.\n \nOur automotive operations are dependent upon the continued ability of our suppliers to deliver the systems, components, raw materials and parts that we need to manufacture our products. Our use of \u201cjust-in-time\u201d manufacturing processes allows us to maintain minimal inventory. As a result, our ability to maintain production is dependent upon our suppliers delivering sufficient quantities of systems, components, raw materials and parts on time to meet our production schedules. In some instances, we purchase systems, components, raw materials and parts that are ultimately derived from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions. Any number of factors, including labor disruptions, catastrophic weather events, the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, such as COVID-19, contractual or other disputes, unfavorable economic or industry conditions, delivery delays or other performance problems or financial difficulties or solvency problems, could disrupt our suppliers\u2019 operations and lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruptions for us, which could, in turn, disrupt our operations, including the production of certain higher margin vehicles. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread or re-emerges and results in a prolonged period of travel, commercial, social and other similar restrictions, we could experience continued and/or additional global supply disruptions. If we experience supply disruptions, we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly. Any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of systems, components, raw materials or parts even for a relatively short period of time could cause us to alter production schedules, increase work-in-process inventory or suspend production entirely, which could cause a loss of revenues or an increase in working capital, which would adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\nIn particular, a global semiconductor supply shortage has had, and is continuing to have, wide-ranging effects across multiple industries, particularly the automotive industry, and it has impacted multiple suppliers that incorporate semiconductors into the parts they supply to us. As a result, the semiconductor supply shortage has had, and depending on how long it persists, could continue to have, a material impact on our operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the global economy may disrupt our business and operations, which could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\n \nPandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks in the U.S. or globally may disrupt our business, which could materially affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and future expectations. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and is continuing to cause, significant disruption to the global economy, including the automotive industry, and has had a material impact on our business. However, the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our operations will depend on future developments, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, any subsequent outbreaks of the virus or any related variants and the efficacy, availability and adoption of vaccines. Future developments are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence and may adversely impact our global supply chain and global manufacturing operations and cause us to again suspend our operations in the U.S. and elsewhere. In particular, if the COVID-19 pandemic continues or re-emerges, particularly in North America where our profits are most concentrated, resulting in a prolonged period of travel, commercial, social and other similar restrictions, we could experience among other things: (1) continued or additional global supply disruptions, including a delayed recovery from the global semiconductor supply shortage; (2) labor disruptions; (3) an inability to manufacture; (4) an inability to sell to our customers; (5) a decline in showroom traffic and customer demand during and following the pandemic; (6) customer defaults on automobile loans and leases; (7) lower than expected pricing on vehicles sold at auction; and (8) an impaired ability to access credit and the capital markets. We may also be subject to enhanced legal risks, including potential litigation related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n \nWe also have substantial cash requirements going forward, including: (1) ongoing cash costs including payments associated with previously announced vehicle recalls, the settlements of multi-district litigation and other recall-related contingencies, payments to service debt and other long-term obligations, including mandatory contributions to our pension plans; and (2) capital expenditures and payments for engineering and product development activities. Our ability to meet these cash requirements may be negatively impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Any resulting financial impact or the duration of such impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, but the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations going forward. \nWe may continue to restructure our operations in the U.S. and various other countries and initiate additional cost reduction actions, but we may not succeed in doing so.\n \nSince 2017, we have undertaken restructuring actions to lower our operating costs in response to difficult market and operating conditions in various parts of the world, including the U.S., \n18\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCanada, Korea, Southeast Asia, India, Africa, Australia and New Zealand and Europe. As we continue to assess our performance throughout our regions, we may take additional restructuring actions to rationalize our operations, which may result in material asset write-downs or impairments and reduce our profitability in the periods incurred. In addition, these restructuring actions subject us to increased risks of labor unrest or strikes, supplier, dealer, or other third-party litigation, regulator claims or proceedings, negative publicity and business disruption. Failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our restructuring and/or cost reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity and cash flows.\nRisks related to our intellectual property, cybersecurity, information technology and data management practices\nCompetitors may independently develop products and services similar to ours, and there are no guarantees that GM\u2019s intellectual property rights would prevent competitors from independently developing or selling those products and services. \n \nThere may be instances where, notwithstanding our intellectual property position, competitive products or services may impact the value of our brands and other intangible assets, and our business may be adversely affected. Moreover, although GM takes reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of GM proprietary information, there can be no assurance that such efforts will completely deter or prevent misappropriation or improper use of our intellectual property. We sometimes face attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology networks and systems for the purpose of improperly acquiring our trade secrets or confidential business information. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, we may be the target of patent enforcement actions by third parties, including aggressive and opportunistic enforcement claims by non-practicing entities. Regardless of the merit of such claims, responding to infringement claims can be expensive and time-consuming. Although we have taken steps to mitigate such risks, if we are found to have infringed any third-party intellectual property rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages, or we could be enjoined from offering some of our products and services. In addition, to prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property, it may be necessary to prosecute actions for infringement, misappropriation or other violation of our intellectual property against third parties. Any such action could result in significant costs and diversion of our resources and management\u2019s attention, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any such action.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions to information technology systems and networked products, including connected vehicles, owned or maintained by us, GM Financial, or third-parties, such as vendors or suppliers, could interfere with our operations and could compromise the confidentiality of private customer data or our proprietary information.\n \nWe rely upon information technology systems and manufacture networked and connected products, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, activities and products. Additionally, we and GM Financial collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property and proprietary business information (including that of our dealers and suppliers), as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks (including networks that may be controlled or maintained by third parties). The secure operation of these systems and products, and the processing and maintenance of the information processed by these systems and products, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Further, customers using our systems rely on the security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our products and the protection of their data. We also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities, including vendors, service providers, suppliers, customers, counterparties, exchanges, clearing agents, clearinghouses or other financial intermediaries. Such parties and other third parties who provide us services or with whom we communicate could also be the source of a cyberattack on, or breach of, our operational systems, network, data or infrastructure. Despite our security measures and business continuity plans, our information technology systems and networked and connected products may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns caused by attacks by hackers, computer viruses, malware (including \u201cransomware\u201d), phishing attacks or breaches due to errors or malfeasance by employees, contractors and others who have access to these systems and products. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise the confidentiality, operational integrity and accessibility of these systems and products and the data that resides within them. Similarly, such an occurrence could result in the compromise or loss of the information processed by these systems and products. Such events could result in, among other things, the loss of proprietary data, interruptions or delays in our business operations and damage to our reputation. In addition, such events could increase the risk of claims alleging that we are non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subjecting us to potential liability or regulatory penalties and related costs under laws protecting the privacy of personal information; disrupt our operations; or reduce the competitive advantage we hope to derive from our investment in advanced technologies. Various events described above have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. Although impacts of past events have been immaterial, the impacts of such events in the future may be material.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions of our in-vehicle systems could impact the safety of our customers and reduce confidence in GM and our products\n.\n \nOur vehicles contain complex information technology systems. These systems control various vehicle functions including engine, transmission, safety, steering, navigation, acceleration, braking, window, door lock functions and battery and electric motors. We have designed, implemented and tested security measures intended to prevent \n19\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nunauthorized access to these systems. However, hackers have reportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to modify, alter and use such systems to gain control of, or to change, our vehicles\u2019 functionality, user interface and performance characteristics, or to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle. Any unauthorized access to or control of our vehicles or their systems could adversely impact the safety of our customers or result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties. Laws that would permit third-party access to vehicle data and related systems could expose our vehicles and vehicle systems to third-party access without appropriate security measures in place, leading to new safety and security risks for our customers and reducing customer trust and confidence in our products. In addition, regardless of their veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our vehicles or their systems could negatively affect our brand and harm our reputation, which could adversely impact our business and operating results.\nOur enterprise data practices, including the collection, use, sharing and security of the Personal Identifiable Information of our customers, employees and suppliers, are subject to increasingly complex and restrictive regulations in all key market regions\n.\n \nUnder these regulations, the failure to maintain compliant data practices could result in consumer complaints and regulatory inquiry, resulting in civil or criminal penalties, as well as brand impact or other harm to our business. In addition, increased consumer sensitivity to real or perceived failures in maintaining acceptable data practices could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations will be high and is likely to increase in the future. The growing patchwork of state and country regulations imposes burdensome obligations on companies to quickly respond to consumer requests, such as requests to delete, disclose and stop selling personal information, with significant fines for noncompliance. Complying with these new laws has significantly increased, and may continue to increase, our operating costs and is driving increased complexity in our operations.\nRisks related to government regulations and litigation\nOur operations and products are subject to extensive laws, regulations and policies, including those related to vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards, which can significantly increase our costs and affect how we do business.\n \nWe are significantly affected by governmental regulations on a global basis that can increase costs related to the production of our vehicles and affect our product portfolio, particularly regulations relating to fuel economy standards and GHG emissions. Meeting or exceeding the requirements of these regulations is costly, often technologically challenging and may require phase-out of internal combustion propulsion in certain major jurisdictions, and these standards are often not harmonized across jurisdictions. We anticipate that the number and extent of these and other regulations, laws and policies, and the related costs and changes to our product portfolio, may increase significantly in the future, primarily motivated by efforts to reduce GHG emissions. Specifically, fuel economy and GHG emission regulations at the federal, state or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to further limit the sale of certain profitable products, subsidize the sale of less profitable ones, change our manufacturing processes, pay penalties or undertake other activities that may require us to incur additional expense, which may be material. These requirements may increase the cost of, and/or diminish demand for, our vehicles. These regulatory requirements, among others, could significantly affect our plans for global product development and, given the uncertainty surrounding enforcement and regulatory definitions and interpretations, may result in substantial costs, including civil or criminal penalties. In addition, an evolving but un-harmonized emissions and fuel economy regulatory framework that could include specific sales mandates may limit or dictate the types of vehicles we sell and where we sell them, which can affect our revenues. Refer to the \u201cEnvironmental and Regulatory Matters\u201d section of Item 1. Business for further information on regulatory and environmental requirements.\nWe expect that to comply with fuel economy and GHG emission standards and mandates to sell specific volumes of ZEV in certain jurisdictions, we will be required to sell a significant volume of EVs, and potentially develop and implement new technologies for conventional internal combustion engines, all of which will require substantial investment and expense. There are limits on our ability to achieve fuel economy improvements over a given time frame, primarily relating to the cost and effectiveness of available technologies, lack of sufficient consumer acceptance of new technologies and of changes in vehicle mix, lack of willingness of consumers to absorb the additional costs of new technologies, the appropriateness (or lack thereof) of certain technologies for use in particular vehicles, the widespread availability (or lack thereof) of supporting infrastructure for new technologies, especially for EVs, and the human, engineering and financial resources necessary to deploy new technologies across a wide range of products and powertrains in a short time. There is no assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicles that use such new technologies on a profitable basis or that our customers will purchase such vehicles in the quantities necessary for us to comply with current or future regulatory requirements.\nIn the current uncertain regulatory framework, compliance costs for which we may be responsible and that are not reasonably estimable could be substantial. Alleged violations of fuel economy or emission standards could result in legal proceedings, the recall of one or more of our products, negotiated remedial actions, fines, restricted product offerings or a combination of any of those items. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition and operations, including facility idling, reduced employment, increased costs and loss of revenue.\n20\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIn addition, many of our advanced technologies, including AVs, present novel issues with which domestic and foreign regulators have only limited experience, and will be subject to evolving regulatory frameworks. Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\nWe could be materially adversely affected by unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations or other proceedings.\n \nWe are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result in the imposition of damages, including punitive damages, fines, reputational harm, civil lawsuits and criminal penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well as legal and other costs, all of which may be significant. For a further discussion of these matters refer to Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business.\n \nGovernment safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a recall could be exacerbated to the extent that such action relates to a global platform, such as the Chevrolet Bolt EV recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers\u2019 financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\nWe may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.\n  We are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks and uncertainties, including those arising from potential changes in laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business, the possibility of adverse determinations with respect to the application of existing laws, changes in our business or structure and changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Any unfavorable resolution of these and other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRisks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n \nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers.\n \nGM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial\u2019s ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial\u2019s business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services at competitive rates include the sufficiency, availability and cost of sources of financing, including credit facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and the residual value performance on vehicles GM Financial leases to customers; fluctuations in interest rates and currencies; competition for customers from commercial banks, credit unions and other financing and leasing companies; and changes to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.\n21\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIn addition, GM Financial has certain floating-rate obligations, hedging transactions and floating-rate dealer loans that determine their applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In March 2021, the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited, the administrator of LIBOR, extended the transition dates of certain LIBOR tenors (including all U.S. Dollar LIBOR tenors other than one-week and two-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR tenors) to June 30, 2023, after which LIBOR reference rates will cease to be provided. Despite this deferral, the LIBOR administrator has advised that no new contracts using U.S. Dollar LIBOR should be entered into after December 31, 2021. It is unknown whether any banks will continue to voluntarily submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR, or whether LIBOR will continue to be published by its administrator based on these submissions or on any other basis, after such dates. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect that these developments or any discontinuance, modification or other reforms may have on LIBOR, other benchmarks or floating-rate debt instruments, including GM Financial\u2019s floating-rate debt. Any such discontinuance, modification, alternative reference rates or other reforms may materially adversely affect interest rates on GM Financial\u2019s current indebtedness. There is a risk that the discontinuation of LIBOR will impact GM Financial's ability to manage interest rate risk effectively without an adequate replacement. \nFurther, as an entity operating in the financial services sector, GM Financial is required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations that may be costly to adhere to and may affect our consolidated operating results. Compliance with these laws and regulations requires that GM Financial maintain forms, processes, procedures, controls and the infrastructure to support these requirements, and these laws and regulations often create operational constraints both on GM Financial\u2019s ability to implement servicing procedures and on pricing. Laws in the financial services industry are designed primarily for the protection of consumers. The failure to comply with these laws could result in significant statutory civil and criminal penalties, monetary damages, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, possible revocation of licenses and damage to reputation, brand and valued customer relationships.\nRisks related to defined benefit pension plans\nOur defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded and our pension funding requirements could increase significantly due to a reduction in funded status as a result of a variety of factors, including weak performance of financial markets, declining interest rates, changes in laws or regulations, or changes in assumptions or investments that do not achieve adequate returns.  \nOur employee benefit plans currently hold a significant amount of equity and fixed income securities. A detailed description of the investment funds and strategies and our potential funding requirements are disclosed in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements, which also describes significant concentrations of risk to the plan investments.\nOur future funding requirements for our defined benefit pension plans depend upon the future performance of assets placed in trusts for these plans, the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels, the level of benefits provided for by the plans and any changes in laws and regulations. Future funding requirements generally increase if the discount rate decreases or if actual asset returns are lower than expected asset returns, assuming other factors are held constant. We estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect on future contributions.\nThere are additional risks due to the complexity and magnitude of our investments. Examples include implementation of significant changes in investment policy, insufficient market liquidity in particular asset classes and the inability to quickly rebalance illiquid and long-term investments.\nFactors that affect future funding requirements for our U.S. defined benefit plans generally affect the required funding for non-U.S. plans. Certain plans outside the U.S. do not have assets and therefore the obligation is funded as benefits are paid. If local legal authorities increase the minimum funding requirements for our non-U.S. plans, we could be required to contribute more funds, which could negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition.\n*\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0*", "item7": ">Item\u00a07. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis MD&A should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes. Forward-looking statements in this MD&A are not guarantees of future performance and may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Refer to the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" section of this MD&A and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties. The discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our \nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020\n is incorporated by reference into this MD&A. \nNon-GAAP Measures \n Our non-GAAP measures include: earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)-adjusted, presented net of noncontrolling interests; earnings before income taxes (EBT)-adjusted for our GM Financial segment; earnings per share (EPS)-diluted-adjusted; effective tax rate-adjusted (ETR-adjusted); return on invested capital-adjusted (ROIC-adjusted) and adjusted automotive free cash flow. Our calculation of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation. As a result, the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute for, related U.S. GAAP measures. \nThese non-GAAP measures allow management and investors to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions to understand operating performance without regard to items we do not consider a component of our core operating performance. Furthermore, these non-GAAP measures allow investors the opportunity to measure and monitor our performance against our externally communicated targets and evaluate the investment decisions being made by management to improve ROIC-adjusted. Management uses these measures in its financial, investment and operational decision-making processes, for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes. Further, our Board of Directors uses certain of these and other measures as key metrics to determine management performance under our performance-based compensation plans. For these reasons, we believe these non-GAAP measures are useful for our investors. \nEBIT-adjusted  \nEBIT-adjusted is presented net of noncontrolling interests and is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated operating results because it excludes automotive interest income, automotive interest expense and income taxes as well as certain additional adjustments that are not considered part of our core operations. \n25\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nExamples of adjustments to EBIT include, but are not limited to, impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions; costs arising from the ignition switch recall and related legal matters; and certain currency devaluations associated with hyperinflationary economies. For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment. \nEPS-diluted-adjusted  \nEPS-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholders-diluted less adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and certain income tax adjustments divided by weighted-average common shares outstanding-diluted. Examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or reversal of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances. \nETR-adjusted  \nETR-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. ETR-adjusted is calculated as Income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by Income before income taxes less adjustments. When we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict. \nROIC-adjusted\n  ROIC-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our investment and capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and other postretirement benefits (OPEB) liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow  \nAdjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. Management actions can include voluntary events such as discretionary contributions to employee benefit plans or nonrecurring specific events such as a closure of a facility that are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.

We will execute our strategy with a diverse team and a steadfast commitment to good citizenship through sustainable operations and a leading health and safety culture.\nThe automotive industry and GM are currently experiencing a global semiconductor supply shortage. The supply shortage has impacted, and continues to impact, multiple suppliers that incorporate semiconductors into the parts they supply to us. We expect the availability of semiconductors to improve throughout 2022. We will continue prioritizing our most popular and in-demand vehicles, including our full-size trucks, full-size SUVs, and EVs. We do not expect this shortage to impact our long-term growth and EV initiatives. In June 2021, we announced plans to increase our investment in EVs and AVs to more than $35.0\u00a0billion from 2020 through 2025, in part to accelerate battery and EV assembly capacity.\nWe also continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and government actions and measures taken to prevent its spread, and the potential to affect our operations. Refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of these risks.\nFor the year ending December 31, 2022, we expect EPS-diluted and EPS-diluted-adjusted of between $6.25 and $7.25, Net income attributable to stockholders of between $9.4 billion and $10.8 billion and EBIT-adjusted of between $13.0 billion and $15.0 billion.

These actions could give rise to future asset impairments or other charges, which may have a material impact on our operating results.\nGMNA  \nIndustry sales in North America were 18.5 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 4.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. U.S. industry sales were 15.4 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 3.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic originally resulted in a contraction of total North America industry volumes in 2020 that continued into 2021. Dealer inventory remains constrained for several critical vehicles, including our full-size trucks and full-size SUVs.\nOur total vehicle sales in the U.S., our largest market in North America, were 2.2 million units for a market share of 14.4% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 2.7 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020. \nWe expect to sustain relatively strong EBIT-adjusted margins in 2022 on the continued strength of favorable vehicle pricing and strong U.S. industry light vehicle demand, partially offset by higher costs associated with commodities, raw materials and logistics. Our outlook is dependent on the pricing environment, continuing improvement of the semiconductor supply shortage and overall economic conditions. As a result of the semiconductor supply shortage, we experienced interruptions to our planned production schedules and temporarily suspended certain manufacturing sites to prioritize production of our most popular and in-demand products, including our full-size trucks and full-size SUVs. Additionally, we have been manufacturing vehicles, without the impacted components, representing an inventory carrying value of approximately $0.6\u00a0billion at December 31, 2021. We expect to hold these vehicles in our inventory until they are completed and sold to our dealers, which we expect to happen in the six months ending June 30, 2022.\nGMI  \nIndustry sales in China were 25.9\u00a0million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 3.8% compared to the corresponding period in 2020, which was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our total vehicle sales in China were 2.9\u00a0million units resulting in a market share of 11.2% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 0.5 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020. The ongoing global semiconductor supply shortage, macro-economic impact of COVID-19 and geopolitical tensions continue to place pressure on China's automotive industry and our vehicle sales in China. Our Automotive China JVs generated equity income of $1.1\u00a0billion in the year ended December 31, 2021. Although price competition, higher costs associated with commodities and raw materials, and a more challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV requirements will place pressure on our operations in China, we will continue to build upon our strong brands, network, and partnerships in China as well as drive improvements in vehicle mix and cost.\nOutside of China, industry sales were 23.0\u00a0million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 8.2% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. Our total vehicle sales outside of China were 0.8\u00a0million units for a market share of 3.6% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 1.1 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020.\nCruise \n Cruise is actively testing AVs in the United States. Gated by safety and regulation, the goal of Cruise is to deliver its self-driving services as soon as possible.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, Cruise Holdings issued Class G Preferred Shares (Cruise Class G Preferred Shares) in exchange for $2.7\u00a0billion from Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft), Walmart Inc. (Walmart) and other investors, including $1.0\u00a0billion from General Motors Holdings LLC.

GM Financial's leasing program is exposed to residual values, which are heavily dependent on used vehicle prices. Used vehicle prices were higher in 2021 compared to 2020 levels, primarily due to low new vehicle inventory. In 2022, we expect used vehicle prices may decrease relative to 2021 levels, but to remain above pre-pandemic levels, primarily due to sustained low new vehicle inventory. The increase in used vehicle prices resulted in gains on terminations of leased vehicles of $2.0\u00a0billion in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses for the year ended \n30\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nDecember 31, 2021, and $1.3\u00a0billion in the corresponding period in 2020.

Volume measures the impact of changes in wholesale vehicle volumes driven by industry volume, market share and changes in dealer stock levels. Mix measures the impact of changes to the regional portfolio due to product, model, trim, country and option penetration in current year wholesale vehicle volumes. Price measures the impact of changes related to Manufacturer\u2019s Suggested Retail Price and various sales allowances. Cost primarily includes: (1) material and freight; (2) manufacturing, engineering, advertising, administrative and selling and warranty expense; and (3) non-vehicle related activity. Other primarily includes foreign exchange and non-vehicle related automotive revenues as well as equity income or loss from our nonconsolidated affiliates.

The remaining portion includes labor costs, depreciation and amortization, engineering, freight and product warranty and recall campaigns.\nFactors that most significantly influence a region's profitability are industry volume, market share, and the relative mix of vehicles (trucks, crossovers, cars) sold. Variable profit is a key indicator of product profitability. Variable profit is defined as revenue less material cost, freight, the variable component of manufacturing expense and warranty and recall-related costs. Vehicles with higher selling prices generally have higher variable profit.

We have completed $1.7 billion of the $5.0 billion program through December 31, 2021.\nCash flows that occur amongst our Automotive, Cruise and GM Financial operations are eliminated when we consolidate our cash flows. Such eliminations include, among other things, collections by Automotive on wholesale accounts receivables financed by dealers through GM Financial, payments between Automotive and GM Financial for accounts receivables transferred by Automotive to GM Financial, loans to Automotive from GM Financial, dividends issued by GM Financial to Automotive, tax payments by GM Financial to Automotive and Automotive cash injections in Cruise. The presentation of Automotive liquidity, Cruise liquidity and GM Financial liquidity presented below includes the impact of cash transactions amongst the sectors that are ultimately eliminated in consolidation.\nAutomotive Liquidity  \nTotal available liquidity includes cash, cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and funds available under credit facilities. The amount of available liquidity is subject to seasonal fluctuations and includes balances held by various business units and subsidiaries worldwide that are needed to fund their operations. \n36\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe manage our liquidity primarily at our treasury centers as well as at certain of our significant consolidated overseas subsidiaries. Over 90% of our cash and marketable debt securities were managed within North America and at our regional treasury centers at December 31, 2021. We have used and will continue to use other methods including intercompany loans to utilize these funds across our global operations as needed.\nOur cash equivalents and marketable debt securities balances are primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars and include investments in U.S. government and agency obligations, foreign government securities, time deposits, corporate debt securities and mortgage and asset-backed securities. Our investment guidelines, which we may change from time to time, prescribe certain minimum credit worthiness thresholds and limit our exposures to any particular sector, asset class, issuance or security type. The majority of our current investments in debt securities are with A/A2 or better rated issuers. \nWe use credit facilities as a mechanism to provide additional flexibility in managing our global liquidity. At December 31, 2020, the total size of our credit facilities was\u00a0$18.5 billion, which consisted principally of four revolving credit facilities. In April 2021, we increased the total borrowing capacity of our five-year, $10.5 billion facility to $11.2 billion and extended the termination date for a $9.9 billion portion of the five-year facility by three years, now set to mature on April 18, 2026. The termination date of April 18, 2023 for the remaining portion of the five-year facility remains unchanged. We also renewed and increased the total borrowing capacity of our three-year, $4.0 billion facility to $4.3 billion, which now matures on April 7, 2024, and renewed our 364-day, $2.0 billion facility allocated for exclusive use by GM Financial, which now matures on April 6, 2022. We also terminated a separate 364-day, $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, entered into in May 2020. Additionally, the prior restrictions on share repurchases and dividends on our common shares were removed upon entrance into the renewed three-year, $4.3 billion facility. In December 2021, we terminated our three-year, $2.0\u00a0billion transformation credit facility. At December 31, 2021, the total size of our credit facilities was $15.5 billion, which consisted primarily of two credit facilities.  \n If available capacity permits, GM Financial has access to our revolving credit facilities. GM Financial did not have borrowings outstanding against our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2021 or 2020. Refer to Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on credit facilities. We had intercompany loans from GM Financial of $0.2\u00a0billion and $0.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, which primarily consisted of commercial loans to dealers we consolidate, and we had no intercompany loans to GM Financial. Refer to Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nSeveral of our loan facilities, including our revolving credit facilities, require compliance with certain financial and operational covenants as well as regular reporting to lenders. We have reviewed our covenants in effect as of December 31, 2021 and determined we are in compliance and expect to remain in compliance in the future. \nGM Financial's Board of Directors declared and paid dividends of $3.5\u00a0billion, $0.8\u00a0billion, and $0.4\u00a0billion on its common stock in 2021, 2020, and 2019. Current dividend levels are reflective of GM Financial earnings supported by strong residual values, favorable credit performance and improved economic conditions. Future dividends from GM Financial will depend on several factors including business and economic conditions, its financial condition, earnings, liquidity requirements and leverage ratio. \n37\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe following table summarizes our Automotive available liquidity (dollars in billions): \nDecember 31, 2021\nDecember 31, 2020\nAutomotive cash and cash equivalents\n$\n14.5\u00a0\n$\n14.2\u00a0\nMarketable debt securities\n7.1\u00a0\n8.1\u00a0\nAutomotive cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities\n21.6\u00a0\n22.3\u00a0\nAvailable under credit facilities(a)\n15.2\u00a0\n18.2\u00a0\nTotal Automotive available liquidity\n$\n36.8\u00a0\n$\n40.5\u00a0\n__________\n(a)\nWe had letters of credit outstanding under our sub-facility of $0.3\u00a0billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in our Automotive available liquidity (dollars in billions): \nYear Ended December 31, 2021\nOperating cash flow\n$\n9.7\u00a0\nCapital expenditures\n(7.4)\nGM investment in Cruise\n(1.0)\nInvestment in Ultium Cells LLC\n(0.5)\nRepayment of senior unsecured notes\n(0.5)\nDecrease in available credit facilities\n(3.0)\nOther non-operating\n(1.0)\nTotal change in automotive available liquidity\n$\n(3.7)\n \nAutomotive Cash Flow (Dollars in billions)\nYears Ended December 31,\n2021 vs. 2020 Change\n2021\n2020\n2019\nOperating Activities\nNet income\n$\n7.8\u00a0\n$\n5.0\u00a0\n$\n5.8\u00a0\n$\n2.8\u00a0\nDepreciation, amortization and impairment charges\n5.9\u00a0\n5.5\u00a0\n6.7\u00a0\n0.4\u00a0\nPension and OPEB activities\n(2.4)\n(1.6)\n(1.5)\n(0.8)\nWorking capital\n(4.0)\n(1.7)\n(2.2)\n(2.3)\nAccrued and other liabilities and income taxes\n0.9\u00a0\n(1.4)\n(1.5)\n2.3\u00a0\nOther\n1.5\u00a0\n1.7\u00a0\n0.1\u00a0\n(0.2)\nNet automotive cash provided by operating activities\n$\n9.7\u00a0\n$\n7.5\u00a0\n$\n7.4\u00a0\n$\n2.2\u00a0\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, the increase in Net automotive cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to: (1) higher dividends received from GM Financial of $2.7 billion; (2) favorable pre-tax earnings of $2.6 billion; partially offset by (3) unfavorable working capital; and (4) several other insignificant items.\n38\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nYears Ended December 31,\n2021 vs. 2020 Change\n2021\n2020\n2019\nInvesting Activities\nCapital expenditures\n$\n(7.4)\n$\n(5.3)\n$\n(7.5)\n$\n(2.1)\nAcquisitions and liquidations of marketable securities, net(a)\n1.0\u00a0\n(3.6)\n2.4\u00a0\n4.6\u00a0\nGM investment in Cruise\n(1.0)\n\u2014\u00a0\n(0.7)\n(1.0)\nInvestment in Ultium Cells LLC\n(0.5)\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n(0.5)\nOther\n(0.3)\n0.1\u00a0\n0.2\u00a0\n(0.4)\nNet automotive cash used in investing activities\n$\n(8.2)\n$\n(8.8)\n$\n(5.6)\n$\n0.6\u00a0\n__________ \n(a)\nAmount includes $0.6 billion and $0.3 billion of proceeds from the sale of our shares in Lyft, Inc. in the year ended December 31, 2020 \nand 2019.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, cash provided by acquisitions and liquidations of marketable securities, net increased due to liquidations of securities to fund operating activities and investments, compared to net acquisitions of securities from revolver proceeds during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nYears Ended December 31,\n2021 vs. 2020 Change\n2021\n2020\n2019\nFinancing Activities\nNet proceeds (payments) from short-term debt\n$\n(0.5)\n$\n(0.5)\n$\n0.5\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\u00a0\nIssuance of senior unsecured notes\n\u2014\u00a0\n4.0\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n(4.0)\nRepayment of senior unsecured notes\n(0.5)\n(0.5)\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\nDividends paid and payments to purchase common stock\n\u2014\u00a0\n(0.6)\n(2.2)\n0.6\u00a0\nOther\n0.1\u00a0\n(0.3)\n(0.4)\n0.4\u00a0\nNet automotive cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n$\n(0.9)\n$\n2.1\u00a0\n$\n(2.1)\n$\n(3.0)\nAdjusted Automotive Free Cash Flow\n  We measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions.

We expect SoftBank to complete the purchase of the majority of such additional preferred shares in the first quarter of 2022 and any balance by the end of 2022. Cruise will need one additional permit from the CPUC, which it has applied for, to commercially deploy such vehicles with paying passengers in California.\n39\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe following table summarizes Cruise's available liquidity (dollars in billions):\nDecember 31, 2021\nDecember 31, 2020\nCruise cash and cash equivalents\n$\n1.6\u00a0\n$\n0.8\u00a0\nCruise marketable securities\n1.5\u00a0\n0.9\u00a0\nTotal Cruise available liquidity (a)\n$\n3.1\u00a0\n$\n1.7\u00a0\n__________ \n(a)\nExcludes a multi-year credit agreement between Cruise and GM Financial whereby Cruise can request to borrow, over time, up to an aggregate of $5.2 billion, through 2024, to fund exclusively the purchase of AVs from GM.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in Cruise's available liquidity (dollars in billions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2021\nOperating cash flow\n$\n(1.2)\nIssuance of Cruise Preferred Shares\n1.7\u00a0\nGM investment in Cruise\n1.0\u00a0\nOther non-operating\n(0.1)\nTotal change in Cruise available liquidity\n$\n1.4\u00a0\nCruise Cash Flow (Dollars in billions)\nYears Ended December 31,\n2021 vs. 2020 Change\n2021\n2020\n2019\nNet cash used in operating activities\n$\n(1.2)\n$\n(0.8)\n$\n(0.8)\n$\n(0.4)\nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(0.7)\n$\n(0.7)\n$\n(0.3)\n$\n\u2014\u00a0\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n$\n2.6\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\u00a0\n$\n1.1\u00a0\n$\n2.6\u00a0\nAutomotive Financing \u2013 GM Financial Liquidity  \nGM Financial's primary sources of cash are finance charge income, leasing income and proceeds from the sale of terminated leased vehicles, net distributions from credit facilities, securitizations, secured and unsecured borrowings and collections and recoveries on finance receivables. GM Financial's primary uses of cash are purchases and funding of finance receivables and leased vehicles, repayment or repurchases of secured and unsecured debt, funding credit enhancement requirements in connection with securitizations and secured credit facilities, interest costs, operating expenses, income taxes and dividend payments. GM Financial continues to monitor and evaluate opportunities to optimize its liquidity position and the mix of its debt between secured and unsecured debt.

GM Financial structures liquidity to support at least six months of GM Financial's expected net cash flows, including new originations, without access to new debt financing transactions or other capital markets activity. \nGM Financial has access to $15.5 billion of our revolving credit facilities with exclusive access to the 364-day, $2.0 billion facility. Refer to the \"Automotive Liquidity\" section of this MD&A for additional details. We have a support agreement with GM Financial which, among other things, establishes commitments of funding from us to GM Financial. This agreement also provides that we will continue to own all of GM Financial\u2019s outstanding voting shares so long as any unsecured debt securities \n40\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nremain outstanding at GM Financial. In addition, we are required to use our commercially reasonable efforts to ensure GM Financial remains a subsidiary borrower under our corporate revolving credit facilities. \nCredit Facilities  \nIn the normal course of business, in addition to using its available cash, GM Financial utilizes borrowings under its credit facilities, which may be secured or unsecured, and GM Financial repays these borrowings as appropriate under its cash management strategy. At December 31, 2021, secured, committed unsecured and uncommitted unsecured credit facilities totaled $26.2 billion, $0.5 billion and $1.2 billion with advances outstanding of $3.5 billion, an insignificant amount and $1.2 billion. \nGM Financial Cash Flow (Dollars in billions)\nYears Ended December 31,\n2021 vs. 2020 Change\n2021\n2020\n2019\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n7.3\u00a0\n$\n8.0\u00a0\n$\n8.1\u00a0\n$\n(0.7)\nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(5.5)\n$\n(9.3)\n$\n(5.0)\n$\n3.8\u00a0\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n$\n(2.6)\n$\n2.4\u00a0\n$\n(3.5)\n$\n(5.0)\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, Net cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to: (1) a decrease in counterparty derivative collateral posting activities of $0.6 billion; and (2) a decrease in leased vehicle income of $0.5 billion; partially offset by (3) a decrease in interest paid of $0.4 billion.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, Net cash used in investing activities decreased primarily due to: (1) an increase in collections and recoveries on finance receivables of $4.9 billion; (2) an increase in proceeds from termination of leased vehicles of $1.0 billion; and (3) an increase in purchases of leased vehicles of $0.6 billion; partially offset by (4) an increase in purchases of retail finance receivables of $2.8 billion.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, Net cash used in financing activities increased primarily due to: (1) a decrease in borrowings of $9.6 billion; (2) an increase in dividend payments of $2.7 billion; and (3) a decrease in preferred stock issuance of $0.5 billion; partially offset by (4) a decrease in debt repayments of $7.8 billion.\nLIBOR Transition  \nAs discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, banks will no longer be persuaded or compelled to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. GM Financial established a LIBOR transition initiative in 2019 to evaluate the potential impacts of the transition, and continues to implement strategies to mitigate the risks associated with the LIBOR discontinuation such as including fallback language into any new LIBOR based contracts. GM Financial has only a limited amount of debt outstanding that is scheduled to mature after June 30, 2023 and would utilize the Alternative Reference Rates Committee fallback process. Furthermore, GM Financial has adhered to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association\u2019s Fallbacks Protocol and plans to transition its existing LIBOR-based derivative exposure in advance of the June 30, 2023 date when applicable LIBOR will no longer be published. For any residual exposure after the end of 2021, GM Financial expects to leverage relevant contractual and statutory solutions to transition such exposure.\nCritical Accounting Estimates  \nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented. We believe the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in developing estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for our significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates. \nProduct Warranty and Recall Campaigns  \nThe estimates related to product warranties are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events. When little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line, the estimate is based on comparable models. \nWe accrue the costs related to product warranty at the time of vehicle sale and we accrue the estimated cost of recall campaigns when they are probable and estimable.\n41\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a paid loss approach that considers the number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost for each recall campaign. These estimates consider the nature, frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns, and use key assumptions including the number of historical periods and the weighting of historical data in the reserve studies. Costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired. Depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may, from time to time, offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers. These estimates are re-evaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information. Revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors. \nThe estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair (take rate) and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. The estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience. A 10% increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.6 billion.\nActual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.\nSales Incentives  \nThe estimated effect of sales incentives offered to dealers and end customers is recorded as a reduction of Automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale. There may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time. Incentive programs are generally specific to brand, model or sales region and are for specified time periods, which may be extended. Significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include type of program, forecasted sales volume, product mix, and the rate of customer acceptance of incentive programs, all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. A change in any of these factors affecting the estimate could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives. A 10% increase in the cost of incentives would increase the sales incentive liability by an insignificant amount. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time, which could affect the revenue previously recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue.\nGM Financial Allowance for Loan Losses \n The GM Financial retail finance receivables portfolio consists of smaller-balance, homogeneous loans that are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses on retail finance receivables reflects net credit losses expected to be incurred over the remaining life of the retail finance receivables, which have a weighted average remaining life of approximately two years. GM Financial forecasts net credit losses based on relevant information about past events, current conditions and forecast economic performance. GM Financial believes that the allowance is adequate to cover expected credit losses on the retail finance receivables; however, because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates, there can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that our credit loss assumptions will not increase.\nGM Financial incorporates its outlook on forecast charge-off recovery rates and overall economic performance in its allowance estimate. Due to the high used vehicle prices in 2021, GM Financial increased its recovery rate forecast as of December 31, 2021. Each 5% relative decrease/increase in the forecast recovery rates would increase/decrease the allowance for loan losses by approximately $0.1 billion. \nAt December 31, 2021, the weightings applied to the economic forecast scenarios considered resulted in an allowance for loan losses on the retail finance receivables portfolio of $1.8 billion. Using different possible weightings that GM Financial could apply to the economic forecast scenarios result in an allowance for loan losses ranging from $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. Actual economic data and recovery rates that are lower than those forecasted by GM Financial could result in an increase to the allowance for loan losses.\nThe GM Financial commercial finance receivables portfolio consists of floorplan financing as well as dealer loans, which are loans to finance improvements to dealership facilities, to provide working capital, or to purchase and/or finance dealership real estate. The allowance for loan losses on commercial finance receivables is based on historical loss experience for the consolidated portfolio, in addition to forecasted industry vehicle sales. There can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that GM Financial's credit loss assumptions will not increase.\n42\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nValuation of GM Financial Equipment on Operating Lease Assets and Residuals  \nGM Financial has investments in leased vehicles recorded as operating leases. Each leased asset in the portfolio represents a vehicle that GM Financial owns and has leased to a customer. At lease inception, an estimate is made of the expected residual value for the vehicle at the end of the lease term, which typically ranges from two to five years. GM Financial estimates the expected residual value based on third-party data that considers various data points and assumptions, including, but not limited to, recent auction values, the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles, significant liquidation of rental or fleet inventory, used vehicle prices, manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices. Realization of the residual values is dependent on the future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions. \nThe customer is obligated to make payments during the lease term for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a money factor. However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, GM Financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the value of the vehicle is lower than the residual value estimated at lease inception. \nAt December 31, 2021, the estimated residual value of GM Financial's leased vehicles was $29.1 billion. Depreciation reduces the carrying value of each leased asset in GM Financial's operating lease portfolio over time from its original acquisition value to its expected residual value at the end of the lease term. In 2021, prices on leased vehicles at termination generally exceeded their contractual residual values due to high used vehicle prices. Accordingly, GM Financial increased the residual value estimates at December 31, 2021, which will result in a prospective decrease in the depreciation rate over the remaining term of the leased vehicles portfolio. If used vehicle prices weaken compared to estimates, GM Financial would increase depreciation expense and/or record an impairment charge on the lease portfolio. If an impairment exists, GM Financial would determine any shortfall in recoverability of the leased vehicle asset groups by year, make and model. Recoverability is calculated as the excess of: (1) the sum of remaining lease payments plus estimated residual value; over (2) leased vehicles, net less deferred revenue. Alternatively, if used vehicle prices outperform GM Financial's latest estimates, it may record gains on sales of off-lease vehicles and/or decreased depreciation expense.  \nThe following table illustrates the effect of a 1% relative change in the estimated residual values at December 31, 2021, which could increase or decrease depreciation expense over the remaining term of the leased vehicle portfolio, holding all other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):\nImpact to Depreciation Expense\n2022\n$\n207\u00a0\n2023\n67\u00a0\n2024\n16\u00a0\n2025 and thereafter\n1\u00a0\nTotal\n$\n291\u00a0\nChanges to residual values are rarely simultaneous across all maturities and segments, and also may impact return rates. If a decrease in residual values is concentrated among specific asset groups, the decrease could result in an immediate impairment charge. GM Financial reviewed the leased vehicle portfolio for indicators of impairment and determined that no impairment indicators were present at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nUsed vehicle prices were higher in 2021 compared to 2020 levels, primarily due to low new vehicle inventory. In 2022, GM Financial expects used vehicle prices may decrease relative to 2021 levels, but to remain above pre-pandemic levels, primarily due to sustained low new vehicle inventory.\nPension and OPEB Plans  \nOur defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, a discount rate, mortality rates of participants and expectation of mortality improvement. Our pension obligations include Korean statutory pension payments that are valued on a walk away basis. The expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return. \n43\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIn December 2021, an investment policy study was completed for the U.S. pension plans. As a result of changes to our capital market assumptions, the weighted-average long-term rate of return on assets decreased from 5.6% at December 31, 2020 to 5.4% at December 31, 2021. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining pension expense for non-U.S. plans is determined in a similar manner to the U.S. plans.\nAnother key assumption in determining net pension and OPEB expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan obligations. We estimate the assumed discount rate for U.S. plans using a cash flow matching approach, which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate bond yield curve to determine the weighted-average discount rate for the calculation of the present value of cash flows. We apply the individual annual yield curve rates instead of the assumed discount rate to determine the service cost and interest cost, which more specifically links the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to bonds maturing in their year of payment. \nThe Society of Actuaries (SOA) issued mortality improvement tables in the three months ended December 31, 2021. We reviewed our recent mortality experience and we determined our current mortality assumptions are appropriate to measure our U.S. pension and OPEB plans obligations as of December 31, 2021.\nSignificant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations. The effects of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in unamortized net actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization to pension expense over future periods. The unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss on our pension plans was $3.7 billion and $8.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The year-over-year change is primarily due to an increase in discount rates and higher than expected asset returns. \nThe underfunded status of the U.S. pension plans improved in the year ended December 31, 2021 to $0.3 billion from $5.4\u00a0billion primarily due to: (1) the favorable effect of actual returns on plan assets of $3.7 billion; (2) the favorable effect of an increase in discount rates of $2.1 billion; and (3) changes in actuarial assumptions, demographic data updates and contributions of $0.5 billion; partially offset by (4) service and interest costs of $1.3\u00a0billion. \nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the pension plans, holding all other assumptions constant:\nU.S. Plans(a)\nNon-U.S. Plans(a)\nEffect on 2022 Pension Expense\nEffect on December 31, 2021 PBO\nEffect on 2022 Pension Expense\nEffect on December 31, 2021 PBO\n25 basis point decrease in discount rate\n-$98\n+$1,502\n-$3\n+$560\n25 basis point increase in discount rate\n+$93\n-$1,439\n+$10\n-$531\n25 basis point decrease in expected rate of return on assets\n+$139\nN/A\n\u00a0+$32\nN/A\n25 basis point increase in expected rate of return on assets\n-$139\nN/A\n\u00a0-$32\nN/A\n__________\n(a)\nThe sensitivity does not include the effects of the individual annual yield curve rates applied for the calculation of the service and interest cost.\nRefer to Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on pension contributions, investment strategies, assumptions, the change in benefit obligations and related plan assets, pension funding requirements and future net benefit payments. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the inputs used to determine fair value for each significant asset class or category. \nValuation of Deferred Tax Assets \n The ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction. The assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted is based on an evaluation of possible sources of taxable income and also considers all available positive and negative evidence factors. Our accounting for the valuation of deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events. Changes in our current estimates, due to unanticipated market conditions, governmental legislative actions or events, could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets. Refer to Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the composition of valuation allowances.\n44\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nForward-Looking Statements \n This report and the other reports filed by us with the SEC from time to time, as well as statements incorporated by reference herein and related comments by our management, may include \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws.

The Financial Risk Council comprises members of our management and functions under the oversight of the Audit Committee and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee and Finance Committee assist and guide the Board of Directors in its oversight of our financial and risk management strategies. A risk management control framework is utilized to monitor the strategies, risks and related hedge positions in accordance with the policies and procedures approved by the Financial Risk Council. Our financial risk management policy is designed to protect against risk arising from extreme adverse market movements on our key exposures. \nAutomotive  \nThe following analyses provide quantitative information regarding exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and equity price risk. Sensitivity analysis is used to measure the potential loss in the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk. The models used assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in exchange rates and interest rate yield curves. For options and other instruments with nonlinear returns, models appropriate to these types of instruments are utilized to determine the effect of market shifts. There are certain shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, primarily due to the assumption that interest rates change in a parallel fashion and that spot exchange rates change instantaneously. In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled and do not contemplate the effects of correlations between foreign currency exposures and offsetting long-short positions in currency or other exposures, such as interest rates, which may significantly reduce the potential loss in value.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk  \nWe have foreign currency exposures related to buying, selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies of our operations. At December 31, 2021, our most significant foreign currency exposures were between the U.S. Dollar and the Canadian Dollar, Chinese Yuan, Korean Won, Brazilian Real, Euro, and Mexican Peso. Derivative instruments such as foreign currency forwards, swaps and options are primarily used to hedge exposures with respect to forecasted revenues, costs and commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Such contracts had remaining maturities of up to 12 months at December 31, 2021.\n\u00a0\nThe net fair value liability of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was $0.7 billion and $0.9 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. These amounts are calculated utilizing a population of foreign currency exchange derivatives and foreign currency denominated debt and exclude the offsetting effect of foreign currency cash, cash equivalents and other assets. The potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10% adverse change in all quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been insignificant at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into U.S. Dollars as part of the consolidation process. We had foreign currency derivatives with notional amounts of $4.2 billion and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The fair value of these derivative financial instruments was insignificant. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe following table summarizes the amounts of automotive foreign currency translation and transaction and remeasurement (gains) losses:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2021\n2020\nTranslation (gains) losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss\n$\n(132)\n$\n387\u00a0\nTransaction and remeasurement (gains) losses recorded in earnings\n$\n(15)\n$\n209\u00a0\nInterest Rate Risk  \nWe are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates related to certain financial instruments, primarily debt, finance lease obligations and certain marketable debt securities. We did not have any interest rate swap positions to manage interest rate exposures in our automotive operations at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The fair value of debt and finance leases was $20.6 billion and $21.6 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The potential increase in fair value resulting from a 10% decrease in quoted interest rates would have been $0.6 billion and $0.7 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n46\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe had marketable debt securities of $8.6 billion and $9.0 billion classified as available-for-sale at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have been insignificant at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nEquity Price Risk  \nWe are subject to equity price risk due to market price volatility primarily related to our investment in Stellantis warrants and other insignificant investments. The fair value of investments with exposure to equity price risk was $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our investment in Stellantis warrants is valued based on a Black-Scholes formula. We estimate that a 10% adverse change in quoted security prices in Stellantis would have had an insignificant effect at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nAutomotive Financing - GM Financial\nInterest Rate Risk\n  Fluctuations in market interest rates can affect GM Financial's gross interest rate spread, which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt. GM Financial is exposed to interest rate risks as financial assets and liabilities have different characteristics that may impact financial performance. These differences may include tenor, yield, re-pricing timing, and prepayment expectations. Typically retail finance receivables and leases purchased by GM Financial earn fixed interest and commercial finance receivables originated by GM Financial earn variable interest. GM Financial funds its business with variable or fixed rate debt. The variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates. To help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding, GM Financial may employ hedging.\nQuantitative Disclosure \n GM Financial measures the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates by using interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis points in all interest rates across all maturities, as well as a base case that assumes that rates perform at the current market forward curve. However, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in our analysis. Therefore, the actual impact to net interest income could be higher or lower than the results detailed in the table below. These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate movements. \nAt December 31, 2021, GM Financial was liability-sensitive, meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest paid on liabilities would increase more than the interest earned on assets, which would initially decrease net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially increase. At December 31, 2020, GM Financial was asset-sensitive, meaning that more assets than liabilities were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest earned on assets would increase more than the interest paid on liabilities, which would initially increase net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially decrease.\nGM Financial's net interest income sensitivity decreased in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increased proportion of rate sensitive liabilities exposure relative to rate sensitive assets exposure. GM Financial's hedging strategies approved by its global asset liability committee are used to manage interest rate risk within policy guidelines. The following table presents GM Financial's net interest income sensitivity to interest rate movement:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2021\n2020\nOne hundred basis points instantaneous increase in interest rates\n$\n(5.1)\n$\n29.7\u00a0\nOne hundred basis points instantaneous decrease in interest rates(a)\n$\n5.1\u00a0\n$\n(29.7)\n__________\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Net interest income sensitivity given a one hundred basis point decrease in interest rates requires an assumption of negative interest rates in markets where existing interest rates are below one percent.\nAdditional Model Assumptions\n  The sensitivity analysis presented is GM Financial's best estimate of the effect of the hypothetical interest rate scenarios; however, actual results could differ. The estimates are also based on assumptions including the amortization and prepayment of the finance receivable portfolio, originations of finance receivables and leases, refinancing of maturing debt, replacement of maturing derivatives and exercise of options embedded in debt and derivatives. The prepayment projections are based on historical experience. If interest rates or other factors change, actual prepayment experience could be different than projected.\n47\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk  \nGM Financial is exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into U.S. Dollars as part of the consolidation process. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect GM Financial's financial condition. \nGM Financial primarily finances its receivables and leased assets with debt in the same currency. When a different currency is used GM Financial may use foreign currency swaps to convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local currency of the receivables and leased assets to minimize any impact to earnings. As a result, GM Financial believes its market risk exposure relating to changes in currency exchange rates at December 31, 2021 was insignificant.\nGM Financial had foreign currency swaps with notional amounts of $8.2 billion and $7.6 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The net fair value of these derivative financial instruments was a liability of $0.2 billion and an asset of $0.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nThe following table summarizes GM Financial's foreign currency translation and transaction and remeasurement (gains) losses:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2021\n2020\nTranslation losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss\n$\n44\u00a0\n$\n82\u00a0\nTransaction and remeasurement gains, net recorded in earnings\n$\n(3)\n$\n(6)\n*\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0*\n48\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n \nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of General Motors Company\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of General Motors Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cfinancial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated\u00a0February 2, 2022\u00a0expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \nProduct warranty and recall campaigns\nDescription of the matter\nAs discussed in Note 12 to the financial statements, the liabilities for product warranty and recall campaigns amount to $9.8 billion at December 31, 2021. The Company accrues for costs related to product warranty at the time of vehicle sale and accrues the estimated cost of recall campaigns when they are probable and estimable.\nAuditing these liabilities involved a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating management\u2019s estimates, due to the size, uncertainties, and potential volatility related to the estimated liabilities. Management\u2019s estimates consider historical claims experience, including the nature, frequency, and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line, and the key assumptions of historical data being predictive of future activity and events, in particular, the number of historical periods used and the weighing of historical data in the reserve studies.\n49\nTable of Contents\nHow we addressed the matter in our audit\nWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company\u2019s product warranty and recall campaign processes. We tested internal controls over management\u2019s review of the valuation models and significant assumptions for product warranty and recall, including the warranty claims forecasted based on the frequency and average cost per warranty claim for product warranty, and the cost estimates related to recall campaigns. Our audit also included the evaluation of controls that address the completeness and accuracy of the data utilized in the valuation models.\nOur audit procedures related to product warranty and recall campaigns also included, among others, evaluating the Company\u2019s estimation methodology, the related significant assumptions and underlying data, and performing analytical procedures to corroborate cost per vehicle based on historical claims data. Furthermore, we performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the significant judgments made by management, including cost estimates to evaluate the impact on reserves from changes in assumptions. We performed analysis over the vehicle lines and model years that had little or no claims experience to ensure the vehicle and model substitutions are comparable. We also involved actuarial specialists to evaluate the methodologies and assumptions, and to test the actuarial calculations used by the Company.\nSales incentives\nDescription of the matter\nAutomotive sales and revenue represents the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or providing services, which is net of dealer and customer sales incentives the Company expects to pay. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, provisions for dealer and customer incentives are recorded as a reduction to Automotive net sales and revenue at the time of vehicle sale. The liabilities for dealer and customer allowances, claims and discounts amount to $3.2 billion at December 31, 2021. \nAuditing the estimate of sales incentives involved a high degree of judgment. Significant factors used by the Company in estimating its liability for retail incentives include type of program, forecasted sales volumes, product mix, and the rate of customer acceptance of incentive programs, all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. The Company\u2019s estimation model reflects the best estimate of the total incentive amount that the Company reasonably expects to pay at the time of sale. The estimated cost of incentives is forward-looking, and could be materially affected by future economic and market conditions.\nHow we addressed the matter in our audit\nWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company\u2019s sales incentive process, including management\u2019s review of the estimation model, the significant assumptions (e.g., incentive cost per unit, customer take rate, and market conditions), and the data inputs used in the model. \nOur audit procedures included, among others, the performance of analytical procedures to develop an independent range of the liability for retail incentives as of the balance sheet date. Our independent range was developed for comparison to the Company\u2019s recorded liability, and is based on historical claims, forecasted spend, and the specific vehicle mix of current dealer stock. In addition, we performed sensitivity analyses over the cost per unit assumption developed by management to evaluate the impact on the liability resulting from a change in the assumption. Lastly, we assessed management\u2019s forecasting process by performing quarterly hindsight analyses to assess the adequacy of prior forecasts.\nValuation of GM Financial Equipment on Operating Leases\nDescription of the matter\nGM Financial has recorded investments in vehicles leased to retail customers under operating leases. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, at the beginning of the lease, management establishes an expected residual value for each vehicle at the end of the lease term. The Company\u2019s estimated residual value of leased vehicles at the end of lease term was $29.1 billion as of December 31, 2021. \n50\nTable of Contents\nAuditing management\u2019s estimate of the residual value of leased vehicles involved a high degree of judgment. Management\u2019s estimate is based, in part, on third-party data which considers inputs including recent auction values and significant assumptions regarding the expected future volume of leased vehicles that will be returned to the Company, used car prices, manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices. Realization of the residual values is dependent on the future ability to market the vehicles under future prevailing market conditions.\nHow we addressed the matter in our audit\nWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company\u2019s controls over the lease residual estimation process, including controls over management\u2019s review of residual value estimates obtained from the Company\u2019s third-party provider and other significant assumptions.\n\u00a0\nOur procedures also included, among others, independently recalculating depreciation related to equipment on operating leases and performing sensitivity analyses related to significant assumptions. We also performed hindsight analyses to assess the propriety of management\u2019s estimate of residual values, as well as tested the completeness and accuracy of data from underlying systems and data warehouses that are used in the estimation models.\n/\ns\n/ ERNST\u00a0& YOUNG LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2017.\nDetroit, Michigan\nFebruary 2, 2022\n51\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n \n\u00a0\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of General Motors Company \nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited General Motors Company and subsidiaries\u2019 internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, General Motors Company and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and our report dated\u00a0February\u00a02, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/\ns\n/ ERNST\u00a0& YOUNG LLP\nDetroit, Michigan\nFebruary 2, 2022\n52\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES", "companyName": "General motors co", "cusip": "369604103"}
