{"item1": ">Item 1. Business \nOverview\nOkta is the leading independent identity provider. Our vision is to free anyone to safely use any technology, and we believe identity is the key to making that happen. Our mission is to bring simple and secure digital access to people and organizations everywhere. The Okta Identity Cloud is powered by our category-defining platform that enables our customers to securely connect the right people to the right technologies and services at the right time.\nThe Okta Identity Cloud helps organizations effectively harness the power of cloud, mobile and web technologies by securing users and connecting them with the applications and technology they use. We designed the Okta Identity Cloud to provide organizations an integrated approach to managing and securing every identity in an organization. Every day, thousands of organizations and millions of people use Okta to securely access a wide range of cloud, mobile and web applications, on-premises servers, application program interfaces (\"APIs\"), IT infrastructure providers and services from a multitude of devices. Developers leverage our platform to securely and efficiently embed identity into the software they build, allowing them to focus on their core mission. Employees and contractors sign into the Okta Identity Cloud to seamlessly and securely access the applications they need to do their most important work. Organizations use our platform to collaborate with their partners, and to provide their customers with more modern and secure experiences in the cloud and via mobile devices. As we add new customers, users, developers and integrations to our platform, our business, customers, partners and users benefit from powerful network effects that increase the value and security of the Okta Identity Cloud.\nThe acceleration of digital transformations, cloud modernization and evolving security threat landscape and changing consumer expectations to simple, secure digital experiences are driving a shift in how organizations manage consumer identities on the internet. Organizations are building secure consumer-facing applications and are turning to identity to optimize seamless and private user experiences. Our approach provides organizations with the scale, efficiency and security they need to build customer-facing applications. \nGiven the growth trends in the number of applications and cloud adoption, and the movement to remote workforces, identity is becoming the most critical layer of an organization\u2019s security. As organizations shift from network-based security models to a Zero Trust security model focusing on adaptive and context-aware controls, identity has become the most reliable way to manage user access and protect digital assets. Our approach to identity allows our customers to simplify and efficiently scale their security infrastructures across internal IT systems and external customer-facing applications. \nWe designed the Okta Identity Cloud to provide organizations an integrated approach to managing and securing all of their identities. Our platform allows our customers to easily provision their customers, employees, contractors, and partners, enabling any user to connect to any device, cloud or application, all with a simple, intuitive and consumer-like user experience.\nAs of January\u00a031, 2022, more than 15,000 customers across nearly every industry used the Okta Identity Cloud to secure and manage identities around the world. Our customers consist of leading global organizations ranging from the largest enterprises, to small and medium-sized businesses, universities, non-profits and government agencies. We partner with leading application, infrastructure and security vendors, such as Amazon Web Services, Cisco, CrowdStrike, Google Cloud, Microsoft, Netskope, Proofpoint, Salesforce, ServiceNow, VMware and Workday. We had over 7,000 integrations with cloud, mobile and web applications and IT infrastructure providers as of January\u00a031, 2022, which while not directly correlated to revenue, shows the breadth and acceptance of our platform.\nOn May\u00a03, 2021, we acquired Auth0, Inc. (\"Auth0\"). Auth0's cloud-native identity and access management solution provides application builders with the building blocks they need to add authentication and authorization to their applications, in a scalable and easy-to-integrate way.\nWe employ a Software-as-a-Service (\"SaaS\") business model, and generate revenue primarily by selling multi-year subscriptions to our cloud-based offerings. We focus on acquiring and retaining our customers and increasing their spending with us through expanding the number of users who access the Okta Identity Cloud and up-selling additional products, including Auth0. We sell our products directly through our field and inside sales \n5\nteams, as well as indirectly through our network of channel partners, including resellers, system integrators and other distribution partners.\nThe Okta Identity Cloud\nThe Okta Identity Cloud is an independent and neutral cloud-based identity solution that allows our customers to integrate with nearly any application, service or cloud that they choose through our secure, reliable and scalable platform and cloud infrastructure. Our technological neutrality allows our customers to easily adopt the best technologies, and our platform is designed to securely connect users to the technology that they choose. We prioritize the compatibility of the Okta Identity Cloud with public clouds, on-premises infrastructures and hybrid clouds. Our customers use the Okta Identity Cloud to secure their workforces, to create solutions that make their partner networks more collaborative, and to provide more seamless and secure experiences for their customers or end users, which combined with our open approach, enables our customers to future-proof their environments.\nThe Okta Identity Cloud can be used as the central system for an organization\u2019s connectivity, access, authentication and identity lifecycle management needs spanning all of its users, technology and applications.\nWe enable our customers to easily deploy, manage and secure applications and devices, and to provision and support users across their IT environments, with a simple, intuitive, consumer-like user experience. Developers are similarly able to leverage a robust set of tools through the platform to quickly build custom cloud, mobile and web application experiences that leverage the breadth and depth of capabilities within the Okta Identity Cloud. Once deployed, we enable administrators to enforce contextual access management decisions based on conditions such as user identity, device, location, application identity, IP reputation and time of day.\nThe Okta Identity Cloud is used by organizations in two distinct and powerful ways. Our customers use it to manage and secure their employees, contractors and partners, which we refer to as workforce identity. Our customers also use it to enable, manage and secure the identities of their own customers via the powerful APIs we have developed, which we refer to as customer identity. The Okta Identity Cloud is underpinned by Okta Platform Services which are the foundational platform components that power our product features. \nWorkforce Identity Cloud\nIn workforce identity use cases, the Okta Identity Cloud simplifies the way an organization\u2019s employees, contractors and partners connect to its applications and data from any device, while increasing efficiency and keeping IT environments secure. We enable organizations to provide their workforces with immediate and secure access to every application they need from any device they use, without requiring multiple credentials, which significantly enhances user connectivity and productivity. We offer our customers an additional security layer through our Adaptive Multi-Factor Authentication product. Our Universal Directory product also serves as a system of record to help our customers organize, customize and manage their users. Our Lifecycle Management product enables customers to manage users\u2019 access privileges through their entire lifecycle with a no-code approach that improves administrative efficiency and productivity. Our Advanced Server Access product is designed to significantly improve our customers\u2019 ability to secure access to cloud-based and on-premises servers, while Okta Access Gateway enables our customers to extend the Okta Identity Cloud to their existing on-premises applications. The Okta Identity Cloud enables our customers to automate access across their growing ecosystem of employees, contractors and partners, increasing collaboration across their workforces.\nCustomer Identity Cloud\nIn customer identity use cases, the Okta Identity Cloud enables organizations to transform their own customers\u2019 experiences by empowering development teams to rapidly and securely build customer-facing cloud, mobile or web applications. We enable an organization\u2019s product team to layer our powerful identity platform into their cloud, web and mobile applications. This makes it easier for them to authenticate, manage, scale and secure their connections, enabling rapid time to market for the business. Organizations are able to centrally manage policy and API-level access across all their applications, leading to more seamless customer experiences that are personalized, engaging and secure.\nThrough our acquisition of Auth0, we are able to support a broader spectrum of customer identity use cases. Auth0 offers a more customizable approach to customer identity for developers, which is complementary to Okta\u2019s customer identity solutions that focus on developers who prefer an out-of-the-box, low-code approach. Auth0 empowers application builders to innovate faster by removing the complexity from identity and making it simple, extensible and customizable. \n6\nPlatform Services\nIn order to enable customers and partners to address a wide range of identity use cases, we have built a set of modular components, called Okta Platform Services, which can be combined to build new features and tailored experiences faster. Okta Platform Services are available in Okta packaged products through APIs and software development kits (\"SDKs\"). Okta Platform Services can be used across both workforce and customer identity use cases. We expect to use Okta Platform Services to continue to enable new and expanded use cases and enable customers or third-party developers to build their own solutions based on an industry use case or unique customer need. Okta Platform Services include Okta\u2019s Identity Engine, Workflows, Devices, Integrations and Insights. Through Auth0, we offer an additional extensible and easy-to-integrate solution for developer-centric use cases.\nGrowth Strategy\nKey elements of our growth strategy are to:\nExecute with Our Platform \n\u2022\nDrive New Customer Growth\n.\u00a0 To increase our market share, we intend to continue to grow our customer base using a land-and-expand sales model, with a focus on key markets by size of customers, as well as key verticals, including highly-regulated sectors.\n\u2022\nDeepen Relationships Within Our Existing Customer Base\n.\u00a0 We plan to further increase revenue from our existing customers by cross-selling and up-selling additional and new products.

We want to empower every application developer to use our platform to securely build authentication into any application. We believe that our secure and seamless access solutions enable developers to focus their time and attention on building their core application capabilities while relying on our platform for their identity related requirements. \n\u2022\nLeverage Our Unique Data Assets with Powerful Analytics\n.   Our position at the intersection of people, devices, applications and infrastructure gives us unique access to powerful data, and the opportunity to \n7\nprovide differentiated insights based on that data, as well as predictive capabilities based on that data to help keep customers more secure. We expect the value of our analytics to our customer base will increase as customers continue to connect more devices, applications and users to their networks and as we add more customers. We also expect that our analytics ability will enable our customers to use our data and third-party data from our partners, to help customers make more informed and secure access decisions. We do not currently derive direct revenue from our unique data assets, but we may explore opportunities for monetization in the future.\n\u2022\nMergers and Acquisitions and Investments\n.   From time to time, we evaluate opportunities to acquire or invest in emerging and adjacent technologies to complement our organic investments and improve our products, services and customers\u2019 experiences. We will continue to use these types of strategic levers as opportunities arise.\nOur Products\nThe Okta Identity Cloud consists of an independent platform with a suite of products and services to manage and secure identities. We are continuously enhancing these products and services. Most of our products can be used for both customer identity and for workforce identity use cases. Our workforce identity products are consumed through web and mobile interfaces, and provide simple ways for IT organizations to manage identities for their employees, contractors and partners. For customer identity, our APIs are also used by developers to embed Okta identity functionality into their own customer-facing mobile or web applications. We continuously improve the Okta Identity Cloud through the release and development of additional products, features and services.\nOkta Products\n\u2022\nUniversal Directory\n.\u00a0\u00a0Universal Directory provides a centralized, cloud-based system of record to store and secure user, application and device profiles for an organization.

Our customers span nearly all industry verticals and range from small organizations with fewer than 100 employees to companies in the Fortune 50, with up to hundreds of thousands of employees, some of which use our platform to manage millions of their customers' identities.\nSales and Marketing\nSales\n10\nWe sell directly to customers through our inside and field sales force and also indirectly through our extensive ecosystem of channel partners. Once a sale is made, we leverage our land-and-expand sales model to generate incremental revenue, often within the term of the initial agreement, through the addition of new users and the sale of additional products. In many instances, we find that initial customer success with our platform results in key internal decision makers expanding their deployments, for example, from initial use for workforce identity to expanded use for their customer identity needs.\n \nFurthermore, as our customers are successful in their businesses and increase headcount or the number of their customers, we share in their growth as the number of identities that we manage increases.\nOur sales organization is structured to address the specific needs of each segment of our target market. Our sales team is divided by geography, customer size and industry vertical. Our direct sales force is supported by our sales engineers, security team, cloud architects, professional services team and other technical resources.\nWe benefit from an expansive partner ecosystem that helps drive additional sales. Nearly all of the leading cloud application providers are our partners, and many of them drive further customer acquisition for us through co-selling arrangements, building our offerings directly into their products, and product demonstrations running on the Okta Identity Cloud. We also partner with several of the large technology companies that are driving the movement to the cloud. In addition to these technology partners, we leverage our channel partners, including system integrators, traditional VARs and Government VARs, to broaden the range of customers we reach.\nMarketing\nOur most valuable marketing features our customers and their successes, and is informed by a deeply data-driven approach, giving us insights into the efficacy of our efforts.

Our competitors vary in size and in the breadth and scope of the products and services offered. However, certain of our competitors have substantial competitive advantages such as significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing, distribution, customer support or other resources, longer operating histories, greater resources to make strategic acquisitions and greater name recognition than we do. Our principal competitor is Microsoft.\nDue to the flexibility and breadth of our platform, we can and often do co-exist alongside our competitors\u2019 products within our customer base.\nPrincipal competitive factors in our markets include flexibility, independence, product capabilities, total cost of ownership, time to value, scalability, user experience, number of pre-built integrations, customer satisfaction, global reach and ease of integration, management and use. We believe our product strategy, platform architecture, \n12\ntechnology and independence as well as our company culture allow us to compete favorably on each of these factors.\nWe expect competition to increase as other established and emerging companies enter our markets, as customer requirements evolve, and as new products and technologies are introduced. We expect this to be particularly true as we are a cloud-based offering, and our competitors may also seek to acquire new offerings or repurpose their existing offerings to provide identity management solutions with subscription models. With the continuing merger and acquisition activity in the technology industry, particularly transactions involving security or identity and access management technologies, there is a greater likelihood that we will compete with other large technology companies in the future in both the workforce identity and customer identity markets. \nAdditional information regarding our competition is included in Part I, Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nHuman Capital Resources\nOur core values \u2013 love our customers, never stop innovating, act with integrity, be transparent and empower our people \u2013 inform and guide our human capital initiatives and objectives. In order to continue to innovate and drive customer success, it is crucial that we continue to attract, develop and retain exceptional talent. To that end, we strive to make Okta a diverse and inclusive workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by fair and competitive compensation, benefits and wellness programs, and by initiatives that foster connections between and among our employees and their communities.\nAs of January\u00a031, 2022, we had 5,030 employees, of which approximately 74% were in the United States and 26% were in our international locations. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. Our employee engagement program helps us understand employee sentiment on a wide range of topics throughout the employee lifecycle, providing insights that inform our decisions about company initiatives, employee programs, talent risks, management opportunities and more. In fiscal 2022, 83% of our eligible employees participated in our annual employee engagement survey.\nWe encourage you to review the \u201cDiversity, Inclusion and Belonging,\u201d \u201cResponsibility,\u201d \u201cCareers\u201d and \u201cOkta for Good\u201d pages of our website at www.okta.com for more detailed information regarding our human capital programs and initiatives. Additional information on our diversity, inclusion and belonging strategy, diversity metrics and programs can be found in our most recent State of Inclusion at Okta annual report located on our website at www.okta.com/state-of-inclusion-at-okta, and additional information on our compensation, benefits and wellness programs is available on our Total Rewards website at rewards.okta.com. The information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPeople First Philosophy\n\u201cEmpower our people\u201d is one of our core values and in fiscal 2022, we introduced our \u201cPeople First\u201d philosophy in which culture, career growth, competitive rewards, flexible work and purpose come together to create a shared sense of ownership in achieving our company vision. As we enter our next phase of growth, bolstered by the addition of Auth0 and its employees, we want every employee to feel ownership of Okta. \nDiversity, Inclusion and Belonging\nWe are committed to fostering a culture of inclusion and belonging, and to building a diverse workforce to drive innovation and collective growth, which we believe is critical to our success. Over the past few years, we have made deeper investments in our diversity, inclusion and belonging (\"DIB\") program at Okta. Our DIB initiatives \u2013 spearheaded by our DIB department, Inclusion Council and employee resource groups (\"ERGs\"), in partnership with various other teams \u2013 focus on DIB in our workforce, in our workplace and in the community.\nWe employ inclusive recruitment and hiring practices to source diverse talent and mitigate potential bias throughout the hiring process. Our engagement with diversity sourcing programs and partnerships allows us to both source top talent from underrepresented groups for current open roles, and further strengthen our ability to build and nurture diverse talent communities for future roles. We also continue to recruit from a range of colleges, including those that support women in computer science and Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and engage with organizations that support diverse students and jobseekers through our social impact arm, Okta for Good. \n13\nNurturing a culture of inclusion and belonging in our workplace is a key priority. We empower our employees to be authentic and grow through open conversations and engagement resources, including regular safe space DIB discussion forums and facilitated workshops, personalized DIB learning tools, mentoring and workplace development programs focused on supporting talent from underrepresented communities, and sponsorship of ERGs that strengthen our DIB culture. We currently have ERGs supporting women, people of color, veterans, the LGBTQIA+ community and parents and caregivers, and plan to launch affinity groups supporting neurodiversity and persons with disabilities in fiscal 2023.\nGrowth and Development\nWe invest significant resources to develop talent and actively foster a learning culture where employees are empowered to drive their personal and professional growth. We provide our employees with a wide range of learning and development opportunities, including in-person, virtual, social and self-directed learning, mentoring, coaching and external development. We offer extensive onboarding and training programs to prepare our employees at all levels for career progression and individual development. \nCompensation, Benefits and Wellness\nWe provide robust compensation, benefits and wellness programs that help support the varying needs of our employees. In addition to market-competitive base pay, short-term bonus incentives and long-term equity incentives, our total rewards program offers comprehensive employee benefits that may vary by country/region, including an employee stock purchase plan, a 401(k) plan with company matching contribution, comprehensive medical, dental and vision insurance, life and disability insurance, health savings accounts, flexible time off, volunteer time off, gender-neutral paid parental leave, fertility and adoption support, family care resources, mobile and internet reimbursement, mental health and lifestyle support programs and a variety of other health and wellness resources. \nWe are committed to fair compensation and opportunity in our workplace. We conduct regular equal pay assessments and adjust as needed to ensure our employees are paid equitably without regard to gender or ethnicity. \nDynamic Work\nWe help our employees succeed by providing flexibility in where and how they work. Over the past few years, we introduced and began transitioning our workforce to a \u201cDynamic Work\u201d framework, based on the premise that enabling our employees to work from anywhere can increase employee empowerment, satisfaction and productivity, drive efficiency and enable us to hire from a broader, more diverse pool of talent. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we accelerated our move to Dynamic Work to protect the health, safety and wellness of our employees.\nLooking forward, we continue to focus on technologies and programs that create equity and build community across our dynamic workforce, including:\n\u2022\nFlexible benefit offerings that allow employee customization;\n\u2022\nWorkplace solutions, such as coworking spaces, outside of our primary office locations that support our distributed teams;   \n\u2022\nA Dynamic Work Sustainability Guide to empower our employees to reduce their carbon footprints wherever they are working from; and\n\u2022\nCurated experience programs that foster a sense of community both in-person and virtually.\nCommunity and Social Impact\nThe mission of our social impact arm, Okta for Good, is to strengthen the connections between people, technology and community, which we believe fosters a more meaningful, fulfilling and enjoyable workplace. Our employees are passionate about many causes and Okta for Good connects them with numerous giving and volunteering opportunities in service of our communities. Okta for Good's core focus areas are:\n\u2022\nDeveloping technology for good ecosystems;\n\u2022\nExpanding economic opportunity and pathways into the technology sector;\n\u2022\nSupporting non-profits addressing critical needs in our global communities; and\n14\n\u2022\nEmpowering our employees to become changemakers. \nThrough Okta for Good, which is a part of our company and not a separate legal entity, we donate and discount access to our service for non-profit organizations, who use the Okta Identity Cloud to make their teams more efficient, allowing them to focus on making a meaningful impact in the world. Our employee volunteer program enables global team members to donate time to support charitable organizations worldwide. \nIn addition, prior to our initial public offering (\"IPO\") in April 2017, we reserved 300,000 shares of our common stock to fund and support the operations of Okta for Good, of which 172,500 shares of Class A common stock remained reserved for future issuances as of January\u00a031, 2022.\nFinancial Information\nThe financial information required under this Item\u00a01 is incorporated herein by reference to the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K titled \u201cPart\u00a0II-Item\u00a08-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d For financial information regarding our business, see \u201cPart\u00a0II-Item\u00a07-Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our consolidated audited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated in 2009 as Saasure Inc., a California corporation, and were later reincorporated in 2010 under the name Okta, Inc. as a Delaware corporation.

In such an event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisk Factor Summary\n15\nThis risk factor summary contains a high-level summary of risks associated with our business. It does not contain all of the information that may be important to you, and you should read this risk factor summary together with the more detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties set forth following this summary. A summary of our risks includes, but is not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have affected how we and our customers are operating our businesses, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain.\n\u2022\nAdverse general economic and market conditions and reductions in workforce identity and customer identity spending may reduce demand for our products, which could harm our revenue, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022\nWe have experienced rapid growth in recent periods, which makes it difficult to forecast our revenue and evaluate our business and future prospects.\n\u2022\nOur recent growth rates may not be indicative of our future growth. As our costs increase, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve and, if achieved, maintain profitability.\n\u2022\nWe have a history of losses, and we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future.\n\u2022\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service and customer satisfaction or adequately address competitive challenges.\n\u2022\nWe face intense competition, especially from larger, well-established companies, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to attract new customers, sell additional products to our existing customers or develop new products and enhancements to our products that achieve market acceptance, our revenue growth and profitability will be harmed.\n\u2022\nOur business depends on our customers renewing their subscriptions and purchasing additional licenses or subscriptions from us. Any material decline in our Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate would harm our future results of operations.\n\u2022\nCustomer growth could fall below expectations.\n\u2022\nWe may experience quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations due to a number of factors that make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our results of operations to fall below analyst or investor expectations.\n\u2022\nThere are risks related to our ability to successfully integrate Auth0 and realize potential benefits from the acquisition.\n\u2022\nIf there are interruptions or performance problems associated with our technology or infrastructure, our existing customers may experience service outages, and our new customers may experience delays in the deployment of our platform.\n\u2022\nAn application, data security or network incident may allow unauthorized access to our systems or data or our customers\u2019 data, disable access to our service, harm our reputation, create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results.\n\u2022\nAny actual or perceived failure by us to comply with the privacy or security provisions of our privacy policy, our contracts and/or legal or regulatory requirements could result in proceedings, actions or penalties against us.\n\u2022\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our capital stock prior to the completion of our IPO, including our directors, executive officers, and their affiliates, who held in the aggregate 42.6% of the voting power of our capital stock as of January\u00a031, 2022. This will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval.\n16\n\u2022\nServicing our debt may require a significant amount of cash. We may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have materially affected how we and our customers are operating our businesses, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain.\nThe extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our future operational and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of COVID-19 and variants of concern, the manufacture, distribution, efficacy and public acceptance of COVID-19 treatments and vaccines, related public health measures, including vaccine mandates, and their impact on the global economy, our customers, employees and vendors. While some governments around the world have lifted restrictions and distributed vaccines, there remains significant uncertainty around the recovery due to the challenging logistics of distributing the vaccines globally, as well as the unknown impact of emerging variants of COVID-19. This pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis that is adversely affecting broader economies and financial markets.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, for most of fiscal 2021, we temporarily closed our offices, required our employees to work from home and implemented significant travel restrictions. We shifted our customer, employee and industry events, including our annual user conferences Oktane20 Live and Oktane21 Live, to virtual-only formats. In fiscal 2022, as the administration of vaccines increased, we reopened our offices to partial capacity, allowing our employees to voluntarily return, and in fiscal 2023, we are shifting to hybrid in-person and virtual sales formats and experiences for future annual user conferences. The conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have and may continue to affect the rate of IT spending and have and could adversely affect our current and potential customers\u2019 ability or willingness to purchase our offerings. It has and could continue to delay current and prospective customers\u2019 purchasing decisions, adversely impact our ability to provide professional services to our customers, delay the provisioning of our offerings, lengthen payment terms, reduce the value or duration of our subscription contracts, or affect customer attrition rates, all of which could adversely affect our future sales, operating results and overall financial performance. \nOur operations have been and may continue to be affected by a range of external factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic that are not within our control. For example, many cities, counties, states and countries imposed or may impose a wide range of restrictions on our employees\u2019, partners\u2019, customers\u2019 and potential customers\u2019 physical movement to limit the spread of COVID-19. If the COVID-19 pandemic has a substantial impact on our employees\u2019, partners\u2019, customers\u2019 or potential customers\u2019 attendance or productivity, our results of operations and overall financial performance may be harmed. \nThe duration and extent of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the efficacy, global availability and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines, the severity and transmission rate of the virus and emerging variants of concern, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, partners and vendors as well as the global economy. Despite our best efforts to manage the impact of such events effectively, our business still may be harmed.\nAdverse general economic and market conditions and reductions in workforce identity and customer identity spending may reduce demand for our products, which could harm our revenue, results of operations and cash flows. \nOur revenue, results of operations and cash flows depend on the overall demand for our products. Concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic, the systemic impact of a widespread recession (in the United States or internationally), energy costs, geopolitical issues or the availability and cost of credit have and could continue to lead to increased market volatility, decreased consumer confidence and diminished growth expectations in the U.S. economy and abroad, which in turn could result in reductions in workforce identity and customer identity spending by our existing and prospective customers. These economic conditions can occur abruptly. Prolonged economic slowdowns may result in customers requesting us to renegotiate existing contracts on less advantageous terms to us than those currently in place or defaulting on payments due on existing contracts or not renewing at the end of the contract term.\nOur customers may merge with other entities who use alternative identity solutions and, during weak economic times, there is an increased risk that one or more of our customers will file for bankruptcy protection, \n17\neither of which may harm our revenue, profitability and results of operations. We also face risk from international customers that file for bankruptcy protection in foreign jurisdictions, particularly given that the application of foreign bankruptcy laws may be more difficult to predict. In addition, we may determine that the cost of pursuing any claim may outweigh the recovery potential of such claim. As a result, if economic growth in countries where we do business slows or if such countries experience further economic recession, it could harm our business, revenue, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in recent periods, which makes it difficult to forecast our revenue and evaluate our business and future prospects. \nMuch of our growth has occurred in recent periods, which makes it difficult to forecast our revenue and evaluate our business and future prospects. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, including the risks and uncertainties described in this document. Additionally, the sales cycle for the evaluation and implementation of our platform, which typically extends for multiple months for enterprise deals, may also cause us to experience a delay between increasing operating expenses and the generation of corresponding revenue, if any. Accordingly, we may be unable to prepare accurate internal financial forecasts or replace anticipated revenue that we do not receive as a result of delays arising from these factors, and our results of operations in future reporting periods may be below the expectations of investors. If we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our estimates and forecasts or the expectations of investors, causing our business to suffer and our stock price to decline.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in recent periods, and our recent growth rates may not be indicative of our future growth. As our costs increase, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve and, if achieved, maintain profitability.\nFrom fiscal\u00a02020\u00a0to fiscal\u00a02021, our revenue grew from\u00a0$586.1 million\u00a0to\u00a0$835.4 million, an increase of\u00a043%,\u00a0and from fiscal\u00a02021\u00a0to fiscal\u00a02022, our revenue grew from\u00a0$835.4 million\u00a0to\u00a0$1,300.2 million, an increase of\u00a056%. In future periods, we may not be able to sustain revenue growth consistent with recent history, or at all. We believe our revenue growth depends on a number of factors, such as macroeconomic conditions and the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as, but not limited to, our ability to:\n\u2022\nprice our platform effectively so that we are able to attract and retain customers without compromising our profitability;\n\u2022\nattract new customers, successfully deploy and implement our platform, upsell or otherwise increase our existing customers\u2019 use of our platform, obtain customer renewals and provide our customers with excellent customer support;\n\u2022\nincrease our network of channel partners, which include resellers, system integrators and other distribution partners and independent software vendors (\u201cISVs\u201d);\n\u2022\nadequately expand our sales force, and maintain or increase our sales force\u2019s productivity;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully identify and enter into agreements with suitable acquisition targets, integrate any acquisitions and integrate acquired technologies into our existing products or use them to develop new products;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully introduce new products, enhance existing products and address new use cases;\n\u2022\nintroduce our platform to new markets outside of the United States;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully compete against larger companies and new market entrants; and\n\u2022\nincrease awareness of our brand on a global basis.\nIf we are unable to accomplish any of these tasks, our revenue growth will be harmed. We also expect our operating expenses to increase in future periods, and if our revenue growth does not increase to offset these anticipated increases in our operating expenses, our business, financial position and results of operations will be harmed, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.\n18\nWe have a history of losses, and we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe have incurred significant net losses in each year since our inception, including net losses of\u00a0$208.9 million,\u00a0$266.3 million\u00a0and $848.4 million in fiscal\u00a02020,\u00a02021 and 2022, respectively. We expect\n \nto continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. Because the market for our platform is rapidly evolving and has not yet reached widespread adoption, it is difficult for us to predict our future results of operations. We expect our operating expenses to significantly increase over the next several years as a result of the Auth0 acquisition, and as we hire additional personnel, particularly in sales and marketing, expand and improve the effectiveness of our distribution channels, expand our operations and infrastructure, both domestically and internationally, pursue business combinations and continue to develop our platform. As we continue to develop as a public company, we may incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur historically. If our revenue does not increase to offset these increases in our operating expenses, we will not be profitable in future periods. While historically, our total revenue has grown, not all components of our total revenue have grown consistently. Further, in future periods, our revenue growth could slow or our revenue could decline for a number of reasons, including slowing demand for our software, increasing competition, any failure to gain or retain channel partners, a decrease in the growth of our overall market, or our failure, for any reason, to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities. As a result, our past financial performance should not be considered indicative of our future performance. Any failure by us to achieve or sustain profitability on a consistent basis could cause the value of our common stock to decline.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service and customer satisfaction or adequately address competitive challenges. \nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, rapid growth and organizational change, which has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our management and our operational and financial resources. For example, our headcount has grown from 2,806 employees as of January\u00a031, 2021 to 5,030 employees as of January\u00a031, 2022. We have also experienced significant growth in the number of customers, users and logins and in the amount of data that our SaaS infrastructure supports. Finally, our organizational structure is becoming more complex as we improve our operational, financial and management controls as well as our reporting systems and procedures. We will require significant capital expenditures and the allocation of valuable management resources to grow and change in these areas without undermining our culture of rapid innovation, teamwork and attention to customer success, which has been central to our growth so far. If we fail to manage our anticipated growth and change in a manner that preserves the key aspects of our corporate culture, the quality of our platform may suffer, which could negatively affect our brand and reputation and harm our ability to retain and attract customers and employees.\nWe have established international offices in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and Europe, and we plan to continue to expand our international operations in the future. Our expansion has placed, and our expected future growth will continue to place, a significant strain on our managerial, customer operations, research and development, marketing and sales, administrative, financial and other resources. If we are unable to manage our continued growth successfully, our business and results of operations could suffer.\nIn addition, as we expand our business, it is important that we continue to maintain a high level of customer service and satisfaction. As our customer base continues to grow, we will need to expand our account management, customer service and other personnel, and our network of ISVs, system integrators and other channel partners, to provide personalized account management and customer service. If we are not able to continue to provide high levels of customer service, our reputation, as well as our business, results of operations and financial condition, could be harmed.\nWe face intense competition, especially from larger, well-established companies, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position. \nThe markets for our products are rapidly evolving, highly competitive and subject to shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new technologies. As the markets in which we operate continue to mature and new technologies and competitors enter such markets, we expect competition to intensify. Our competitor categories include, but are not limited to: \n\u2022\nAuthentication providers;\n\u2022\nAccess and lifecycle management providers; \n\u2022\nMulti-factor authentication providers; \n19\n\u2022\nInfrastructure-as-a-service providers;\n\u2022\nOther customer identity and access management providers; and\n\u2022\nSolutions developed in-house by our potential customers.\nWe compete with both cloud-based and on-premise enterprise application software providers. Our competitors vary in size and in the breadth and scope of the products and services offered. However, many of our competitors have substantial competitive advantages such as significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing, distribution, customer support or other resources, larger intellectual property portfolios, longer operating histories, greater resources to make strategic acquisitions and greater name recognition than we do. Our principal competitor is Microsoft. \nWith the continuing merger and acquisition activity in the technology industry, particularly transactions involving security or identity and access management technologies, there is a greater likelihood that we will compete with other large technology companies in the future in both the workforce identity and customer identity markets. \nIn addition, some of our larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products to gain business in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products, including through selling at zero or negative margins, product bundling or closed technology platforms. Potential customers may also prefer to purchase from their existing suppliers rather than a new supplier regardless of product performance or features. These larger competitors often have broader product lines and market focus and as a result are not as susceptible to downturns in a particular market. Our competitors may also seek to acquire new offerings or repurpose their existing offerings to provide identity solutions with subscription models. Conditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements, partnering by our competitors or continuing market consolidation. New start-up companies that innovate and large competitors that are making significant investments in research and development may invent similar or superior products and technologies that compete with our products. In addition, some of our competitors may enter into new alliances with each other or may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with systems integrators, third-party consulting firms or other parties. Any such consolidation, acquisition, alliance or cooperative relationship could lead to pricing pressure and our loss of market share and could result in a competitor with greater financial, technical, marketing, service and other resources, all of which could harm our ability to compete. Furthermore, organizations may be more willing to incrementally add solutions to their existing infrastructure from competitors than to replace their existing infrastructure with our products. These competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions, fewer orders, reduced revenue and gross margins, increased net losses, and loss of market share. Any failure to meet and address these factors could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers, sell additional products to our existing customers or develop new products and enhancements to our products that achieve market acceptance, our revenue growth and profitability will be harmed. \nTo increase our revenue and achieve and maintain profitability, we must add new customers or sell additional products to our existing customers. Numerous factors, however, may impede our ability to add new customers and sell additional products to our existing customers, including our failure to convert new organizations into paying customers, failure to attract, effectively train, retain and motivate sales and marketing personnel, failure to develop or expand relationships with channel partners, failure to successfully deploy products for new customers and provide quality customer support or failure to ensure the effectiveness of our marketing programs. In addition, if prospective customers do not perceive our platform to be of sufficiently high value and quality, we will not be able to attract the number and types of new customers that we are seeking.\nIn addition, our ability to attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers depends in large part on our ability to enhance and improve our existing products and to introduce compelling new products that reflect the changing nature of our markets. The success of any enhancement to our products depends on several factors, including timely completion and delivery, competitive pricing, adequate quality testing, integration with existing technologies and our platform and overall market acceptance. If we are unable to successfully develop new products, enhance our existing products to meet customer requirements, or otherwise gain market acceptance, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed.\n20\nFurther, to grow our business, we must convince developers to adopt and build their applications using our APIs and products. We believe that these developer-built applications facilitate greater usage and customization of our products. If these developers stop developing on or supporting our platform, we will lose the benefit of network effects that have contributed to the growth in our number of customers, and our business (including the performance levels of our products), results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur business depends on our customers renewing their subscriptions and purchasing additional licenses or subscriptions from us. Any material decline in our Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate would harm our future results of operations.\nTo continue to grow our business, it is important that our customers renew their subscriptions when existing contract terms expire and that we expand our commercial relationships with our existing customers. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions, and our customers may decide not to renew their subscriptions with a similar contract period, at the same prices and terms or with the same or a greater number of users. We have experienced significant growth in the number of users of our platform, but we do not know whether we will continue to achieve similar user growth rates in the future. In the past, some of our customers have elected not to renew their agreements with us, and it is difficult to accurately predict long-term customer retention and expansion rates. Our customer retention and expansion may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including our customers\u2019 satisfaction with our products, our product support, our prices and pricing plans, particularly in light of COVID-19-related economic conditions, the prices of competing software products, reductions in our customers\u2019 spending levels, user adoption of our platform, deployment success, utilization rates by our customers, new product releases and changes to the packaging of our product offerings. If our customers do not purchase additional subscriptions or renew their subscriptions, renew on less favorable terms or fail to add more users, our revenue may decline or grow less quickly than anticipated, which would harm our future results of operations. Furthermore, if our contractual subscription terms were to shorten it could lead to increased volatility of, and diminished visibility into, future recurring revenue. If our sales of new or recurring subscriptions and software-related support service contracts decline from existing customers, our revenue and revenue growth may decline, and our business will suffer.\nCustomer growth could fall below expectations.\nWe have experienced significant growth in the number of our customers in recent periods. As our customer base continues to grow and as we increase our focus on sales to the world\u2019s largest organizations, we do not expect customer growth to continue at the same pace as it has previously. These factors could cause customer growth to fall below analyst or investor expectations. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons, the market price of our Class A common stock could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nWe may experience quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations due to a number of factors that make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our results of operations to fall below analyst or investor expectations. \nOur quarterly results of operations fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe level of demand for our platform;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract new customers, obtain renewals from existing customers and upsell or otherwise increase our existing customers\u2019 use of our platform;\n\u2022\nhealth epidemics, such as COVID-19, influenza and other highly communicable diseases or viruses;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success of new product introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive landscape of our market;\n\u2022\npricing pressure as a result of competition, COVID-19 or otherwise;\n\u2022\nseasonal buying patterns for IT spending;\n\u2022\nthe mix of revenue attributable to larger transactions as opposed to smaller transactions, and the associated volatility and timing of our transactions;\n21\n\u2022\nchanges in remaining performance obligations (\u201cRPO\u201d) due to seasonality, the timing of and compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, size and timing, new business linearity between quarters and within a quarter, average contract term or fluctuations due to foreign currency movements, all of which may impact implied growth rates;\n\u2022\nerrors in our forecasting of the demand for our products, which could lead to lower revenue, increased costs or both;\n\u2022\nincreases in and timing of sales and marketing and other operating expenses that we may incur to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive;\n\u2022\nsignificant security breaches of, technical difficulties with, or interruptions to, the delivery and use of our platform and products; \n\u2022\nour ability to comply with privacy laws and requirements, including the General Data Protection Regulation and California Consumer Privacy Act;\n\u2022\ncosts related to the acquisition of businesses, talent, technologies or intellectual property, including potentially significant amortization costs and possible write-downs; \n\u2022\ncredit or other difficulties confronting our channel partners;\n\u2022\nadverse litigation judgments, settlements of litigation and other disputes or other litigation-related or dispute-related costs;\n\u2022\nthe impact of new accounting pronouncements and associated system implementations;\n\u2022\nchanges in the legislative or regulatory environment;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nexpenses related to real estate, including our office leases, and other fixed expenses; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions in either domestic or international markets, including geopolitical uncertainty and instability.\nAny one or more of the factors above may result in significant fluctuations in our results of operations. You should not rely on our past results as an indicator of our future performance.\nThe variability and unpredictability of our quarterly results of operations or other operating metrics could result in our failure to meet our expectations or those of analysts that cover us or investors with respect to revenue or other metrics for a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons, the market price of our Class A common stock could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nOur ability to introduce new products and features is dependent on adequate research and development resources and our ability to successfully complete acquisitions.\u00a0If we do not adequately fund our research and development efforts or complete acquisitions successfully, we may not be able to compete effectively and our business and results of operations may be harmed.\nTo remain competitive, we must continue to develop new products, applications and enhancements to our existing platform. This is particularly true as we further expand and diversify our capabilities. Maintaining adequate research and development resources, such as the appropriate personnel and development technology, to meet the demands of the market is essential. If we elect not to or are unable to develop products internally, we may choose to expand into a certain market or strategy via an acquisition for which we could potentially pay too much or fail to successfully integrate into our operations. Further, many of our competitors expend a considerably greater amount of funds on their respective research and development programs, and those that do not may be acquired by larger companies that could allocate greater resources to our competitors\u2019 research and development programs. Our failure to maintain adequate research and development resources or to compete effectively with the research and development programs of our competitors would give an advantage to such competitors and may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n22\nFuture acquisitions, investments, partnerships or alliances could be difficult to identify and integrate, divert the attention of management personnel, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have in the past acquired, and we may in the future seek to acquire or invest in, businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our current platform, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated. In addition, we have limited experience in acquiring other businesses. If we acquire additional businesses, we may not be able to successfully integrate and retain the acquired personnel, integrate the acquired operations and technologies, adequately test and assimilate the internal control processes of the acquired business in accordance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. \nWe may not be able to find and identify desirable acquisition targets or we may not be successful in entering into an agreement with any particular target. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities, use of our available cash or the incurrence of debt, or in adverse tax consequences or unfavorable accounting treatment, which could harm our results of operations.\nIn addition, from time to time we invest in private growth stage companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives, and we may not realize a return on these investments. All of our venture investments are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of investment capital.\nAcquisitions and strategic transactions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\ndelays or reductions in customer purchases for both us and the acquired business; \n\u2022\ndisruption of partner and customer relationships;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees of the acquired company;\n\u2022\nclaims by and disputes with the acquired company\u2019s employees, customers, stockholders or third parties;\n\u2022\nunknown liabilities or risks associated with the acquired business, product or technology, such as contractual obligations, potential security vulnerabilities of the acquired company and its products and services, potential intellectual property infringement, costs arising from the acquired company\u2019s failure to comply with legal or regulatory requirements and litigation matters;\n\u2022\nacquired technologies or products may not comply with legal or regulatory requirements and may require us to make additional investments to make them compliant;\n\u2022\nacquired technologies or products may not be able to provide the same support service levels that we generally offer with our other products; \n\u2022\nacquired businesses, technologies or products could be viewed unfavorably by our partners, our customers, our stockholders or securities analysts;\n\u2022\nunforeseen integration or other expenses; and\n\u2022\nfuture impairment of goodwill or other acquired intangible assets. \nIn addition, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer. For further risks related to our acquisition of Auth0, please see below under \u201cRisks Related to the Acquisition of Auth0.\u201d\nBecause our long-term success depends, in part, on our ability to expand the sales of our products to customers located outside of the United States, our business will be susceptible to risks associated with international operations. \nWe currently have sales personnel outside the United States and maintain offices outside the United States in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and Europe, and we plan to expand our international operations. We also have added several offices outside the United States through our acquisition of Auth0.\n23\nOur international revenue was 16% and 20% of our total revenue in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, respectively. Any international expansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful. In addition, conducting international operations subjects us to new risks, some of which we have not generally faced in the United States. These risks include, among other things:\n\u2022\nhealth epidemics, such as COVID-19, influenza and other highly communicable diseases or viruses;\n\u2022\nmacroeconomic conditions and the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nunexpected costs and errors in the localization of our products, including translation into foreign languages and adaptation for local practices and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nlack of familiarity and burdens of complying with foreign laws, legal standards, privacy standards, regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local competitors or commercial parties;\n\u2022\ncosts and liabilities related to compliance with the numerous and ever-growing landscape of U.S. and international data privacy and cybersecurity regimes, many of which involve disparate standards and enforcement approaches;\n\u2022\ngreater risk that our foreign employees or partners will fail to comply with U.S. and foreign laws;\n\u2022\npractical difficulties of enforcing intellectual property rights in countries with fluctuating laws and standards and reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022\nrestrictive governmental actions focusing on cross-border trade, including taxes, trade laws, tariffs, import and export restrictions or quotas, barriers, sanctions, custom duties or other trade restrictions;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing systems integrators and technology partners;\n\u2022\ndiffering technology standards;\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing and staffing international operations and differing employer/employee relationships and local employment laws;\n\u2022\npolitical, economic and social instability, war, terrorist activities or armed conflict, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine;\n\u2022\nglobal economic uncertainty caused by global political events, including the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, and similar geopolitical developments;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in exchange rates that may increase the volatility of our foreign-based revenue and expense; and\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added tax (or other tax) systems and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings.\nAdditionally, operating in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources. We cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required in establishing operations in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability.\nWe have not engaged in currency hedging activities to limit risk of exchange rate fluctuations. Changes in exchange rates affect our costs and earnings, and may also affect the book value of our assets located outside the United States and the amount of our stockholders\u2019 equity.\nWe have limited experience in marketing, selling and supporting our platform abroad. Our limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future expansion efforts that we may undertake will not be successful. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations and are unable to do so successfully and in a timely manner, our business and results of operations will suffer.\n24\nIf we fail to adapt to rapid technological change, our ability to remain competitive could be impaired.\nThe industry in which we compete is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent introductions of new products and evolving industry standards. Our ability to attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers will depend in significant part on our ability to anticipate industry standards and trends and continue to enhance existing products or introduce or acquire new products on a timely basis to keep pace with technological developments. The success of any enhancement or new product depends on several factors, including the timely completion and market acceptance of the enhancement or new product. Any new product we develop or acquire might not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner and might not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue. If any of our competitors implements new technologies before we are able to implement them, those competitors may be able to provide more effective products than ours at lower prices. Any delay or failure in the introduction of new or enhanced products could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur financial results may fluctuate due to increasing variability in our sales cycles. \nWe plan our expenses based on certain assumptions about the length and variability of our sales cycle. These assumptions are based upon historical trends for sales cycles and conversion rates associated with our existing customers. As we continue to focus on sales to larger organizations and in light of the current COVID-19 environment, our sales cycles are lengthening in certain circumstances and becoming less predictable, which may harm our financial results. Other factors that may influence the length and variability of our sales cycle include, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe need to raise awareness about the uses and benefits of our platform, including our customer identity products;\n\u2022\nthe need to allay privacy, regulatory and security concerns;\n\u2022\nthe discretionary nature of purchasing and budget cycles and decisions;\n\u2022\nthe competitive nature of evaluation and purchasing processes;\n\u2022\nannouncements or planned introductions of new products, features or functionality by us or our competitors; and\n\u2022\noften lengthy purchasing approval processes.\nOur increasing focus on sales to larger organizations may further increase the variability of our financial results. If we are unable to close one or more of such expected significant transactions in a particular period, or if such an expected transaction is delayed until a subsequent period, our results of operations for that period, and for any future periods in which revenue from such transaction would otherwise have been recognized, may be harmed.\nOur growth depends, in part, on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties. \nTo grow our business, we anticipate that we will continue to depend on relationships with third parties, such as channel partners. Identifying partners, and negotiating and documenting relationships with them, requires significant time and resources. Our competitors may be effective in causing third parties to favor their products or services over subscriptions to our platform. In addition, acquisitions of such partners by our competitors could result in a decrease in the number of our current and potential customers, as these partners may no longer facilitate the adoption of our applications by potential customers. Further, some of our partners are or may become competitive with certain of our products and may elect to no longer integrate with our platform. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired, and our results of operations may suffer. Even if we are successful, we cannot ensure that these relationships will result in increased customer usage of our applications or increased revenue.\nFailure to effectively develop and expand our marketing and sales capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our products. \nOur ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our products will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our marketing and sales operations. We plan to continue expanding our direct sales force and engaging additional channel partners, both domestically and internationally. This expansion will require us to invest significant financial and other resources. Our business will be harmed if our \n25\nefforts do not generate a corresponding increase in revenue. We may not achieve anticipated revenue growth from expanding our direct sales force if we are unable to hire and develop talented direct sales personnel, if our new direct sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time or if we are unable to retain our existing direct sales personnel. We also may not achieve anticipated revenue growth from our\n \nchannel partners if we are unable to attract and retain additional motivated channel partners, if any existing or future channel partners fail to successfully market, resell, implement or support our products for their customers, or if they represent multiple providers and devote greater resources to market, resell, implement and support the products and solutions of these other providers. For example, some of our channel partners also sell or provide integration and administration services for our competitors\u2019 products, and if such channel partners devote greater resources to marketing, reselling and supporting competing products, this could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nVarious factors may cause our product implementations to be delayed, inefficient or otherwise unsuccessful. \nOur business depends upon the successful implementation of our products by our customers. Increasingly, we, as well as our customers, rely on our network of partners to deliver implementation services, and there may not be enough qualified implementation partners available to meet customer demand. Various factors may cause implementations to be delayed, inefficient or otherwise unsuccessful. For example, changes in the functional requirements of our customers, delays in timeline, or deviation from recommended best practices may occur during the course of an implementation project. As a result of these and other risks, we or our customers may incur significant implementation costs in connection with the purchase, implementation and enablement of our products. Some customer implementations may take longer than planned or fail to meet our customers\u2019 expectations, which may delay our ability to sell additional products or result in customers canceling or failing to renew their subscriptions before our products have been fully implemented. Unsuccessful, lengthy, or costly customer implementation and integration projects could result in claims from customers, harm to our reputation, and opportunities for competitors to displace our products, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nA portion of our revenues are generated by sales to government entities, which are subject to a number of challenges and risks. \nA portion of our sales are to partners that resell our services to government agencies, and we have made, and plan to continue to make, investments to support future sales opportunities in the government sector. The sale of our services to government agencies is tied to budget cycles, and there are government requirements and authorizations that we may be required to meet. Further, we may be subject to audits and investigations regarding our role as a subcontractor in government contracts, and violations could result in penalties and sanctions, including contract termination, refunding or forfeiting payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. Selling to these entities can be highly competitive, expensive and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense. Government entities often require contract terms that differ from our standard arrangements and impose additional compliance requirements, require increased attention to pricing practices, or are otherwise time consuming and expensive to satisfy. Government entities may also have statutory, contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our partners for convenience, for lack of funding or due to a default, and any such termination may adversely impact our future results of operations. If we represent that we meet certain standards or requirements and do not meet them, we could be subject to increased liability from our customers, investigation by regulators or termination rights. Even if we do meet them, the additional costs associated with providing our service to government entities could harm our margins. Moreover, changes in underlying regulatory requirements could be an impediment to our ability to efficiently provide our service to government customers and to grow or maintain our customer base. Any of these risks related to contracting with government entities could adversely impact our future sales and results of operations, or make them more difficult to predict\n. \n26\nIf we fail to enhance our brand cost-effectively, our ability to expand our customer base will be impaired and our business, results of operations and financial condition may suffer.\nWe believe that developing and maintaining awareness of our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future products and is an important element in attracting new customers. Furthermore, we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market increases. Successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful products at competitive prices. In the past, our efforts to build our brand have involved significant expenses. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand, we may fail to attract new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer.\nWe may not set optimal prices for our products. \nIn the past, we have at times adjusted our prices either for individual customers in connection with long-term agreements or for a particular product. We expect that we may need to change our pricing in future periods and potentially in response to COVID-19 pricing pressures. Further, as competitors introduce new products that compete with ours or reduce their prices, we may be unable to attract new customers or retain existing customers based on our historical pricing. As we expand internationally, we also must determine the appropriate price to enable us to compete effectively internationally. In addition, if our mix of products sold changes, then we may need to, or choose to, revise our pricing. As a result, we may be required or choose to reduce our prices or change our pricing model, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur failure to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in new technologies in the future could reduce our ability to compete successfully and harm our results of operations.\nWe may need to raise additional funds, and we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we raise additional equity or convertible debt financing, our security holders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests. If we engage in additional debt financing, we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios or restrict our ability to pay dividends or make acquisitions. If we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, or at all, we may not be able to, among other things:\n\u2022\ndevelop and enhance our products;\n\u2022\ncontinue to expand our product development, sales and marketing organizations;\n\u2022\nhire, train and retain employees;\n\u2022\nrespond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements; or\n\u2022\npursue acquisition opportunities.\nOur inability to do any of the foregoing could reduce our ability to compete successfully and harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to liability claims if we breach our contracts and our insurance may be inadequate to cover our losses.\nWe are subject to numerous obligations in our contracts with our customers and partners.\u00a0Despite the procedures, systems and internal controls we have implemented to comply with our contracts, we may breach these commitments, whether through a weakness in these procedures, systems and internal controls, negligence or the willful act of an employee or contractor. Our\u00a0insurance policies, including our errors and omissions insurance, may be inadequate to compensate us for the potentially significant losses that may result from claims arising from breaches of our contracts, disruptions in our service, including those caused by cybersecurity incidents, failures or disruptions to our infrastructure, catastrophic events and disasters or otherwise. In addition, such insurance may not be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Further, our insurance may not cover all \n27\nclaims made against us and defending a suit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management\u2019s attention.\nRisks Related to the Acquisition of Auth0\nThe ongoing integration of Auth0 may cause a disruption in our business.\nThe ongoing integration following the acquisition of Auth0 (the \u201cAcquisition\u201d) could cause disruptions to our business or business relationships, which could have an adverse impact on results of operations. Parties with which we have business relationships may experience uncertainty as to the future of such relationships and may delay or defer certain business decisions, seek alternative relationships with third parties or seek to alter their present business relationships with us. Parties with whom we otherwise may have sought to establish business relationships may seek alternative relationships with third parties.\nThe ongoing integration of Auth0 may place a significant burden on our management and internal resources. The diversion of management\u2019s attention away from day-to-day business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the integration process could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Acquisition. We may also incur unanticipated costs in the integration of Auth0\u2019s business with our business. The substantial majority of these costs will be non-recurring expenses relating to the Acquisition. We also could be subject to litigation related to the Acquisition, which could result in significant costs and expenses.\nWe may not realize potential benefits from the Acquisition because of difficulties related to integration, the achievement of synergies, and other challenges.\nPrior to the consummation of the Acquisition, we and Auth0 operated independently, and there can be no assurances that our businesses can be combined in a manner that allows for the achievement of substantial benefits. The ongoing integration process may require significant time and resources, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully as our ability to acquire and integrate larger or more complex companies, products or technologies in a successful manner is unproven. If we are not able to successfully integrate Auth0\u2019s businesses with ours or pursue our customer and product strategy successfully, the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition may not be realized fully or may take longer than expected to be realized. Further, it is possible that there could be a loss of our and/or Auth0\u2019s key employees and customers, disruption of either company\u2019s or both companies\u2019 ongoing businesses or unexpected issues, higher than expected costs and an overall post\u2011completion process that takes longer than originally anticipated. Specifically, the following issues, among others, must be addressed in combining Auth0\u2019s operations with ours in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition:\n\u2022\ncombining the companies\u2019 corporate functions;\n\u2022\ncombining Auth0\u2019s business with our business in a manner that permits us to achieve the synergies anticipated to result from the Acquisition, the failure of which would result in the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition not being realized in the timeframe currently anticipated or at all;\n\u2022\nmaintaining existing agreements with customers, distributors, providers, talent and vendors and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective customers, distributors, providers, talent and vendors;\n\u2022\ndetermining whether and how to address possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies;\n\u2022\nintegrating the companies\u2019 administrative and information technology infrastructure;\n\u2022\ndeveloping products and technology that allow value to be unlocked in the future; and\n\u2022\nevaluating and forecasting the financial impact of the Acquisition transaction.\nIn addition, at times the attention of certain members of our management and resources may be focused on integration of the businesses of the two companies and diverted from day\u2011to\u2011day business operations, which may disrupt our ongoing business and the business of the combined company.\n28\nWe may incur significant, non\u2011recurring costs in connection with the Acquisition and integrating the operations of Okta and Auth0, including costs to maintain employee morale and to retain key employees. Management cannot ensure that the elimination of duplicative costs or the realization of other efficiencies will offset the transaction and integration costs in the long term or at all.\nPurchase price accounting in connection with our Acquisition requires estimates that may be subject to change and could impact our consolidated financial statements and future results of operations and financial position.\nPursuant to the acquisition method of accounting, the purchase price we paid for Auth0 has been allocated to the underlying Auth0 tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair market values with any excess purchase price allocated to goodwill. The acquisition method of accounting is dependent upon certain valuations and other studies that are preliminary. Accordingly, the purchase price allocation as of the Acquisition date is preliminary. We currently anticipate that all the information needed to identify and measure values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be obtained and finalized during the one\u2011year measurement period following the date of completion of the Acquisition. Differences between these preliminary estimates and the final acquisition accounting may occur, and these differences could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and the combined company\u2019s future results of operations and financial position.\nAuth0 may have liabilities that are not known to us.\nAuth0 may have liabilities that we failed, or were unable, to discover, or that we underestimated, in the course of performing our due diligence investigations of Auth0\u2019s business and we, as the successor owner of such acquired company, might be responsible for those liabilities. Such potential liabilities could include employment-related obligations under applicable law or other benefits arrangements, legal or regulatory claims, tax liabilities, warranty or similar liabilities to customers, product liabilities, claims related to infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, and claims by or amounts owed to vendors or other third parties. We cannot assure you that the indemnification available to us under the Merger Agreement with respect to the Acquisition will be sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with Auth0\u2019s business or property that we assumed upon consummation of the Acquisition. We may learn additional information about Auth0 that materially adversely affects us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and liabilities related to compliance with applicable laws. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property, Infrastructure Technology, Data Privacy and Security\nIf there are interruptions or performance problems associated with our technology or infrastructure,\u00a0our existing customers may experience service outages, and our new customers may experience delays in the deployment of our platform. \nOur continued growth depends, in part, on the ability of our existing and potential customers to access our platform 24 hours a day, seven days a week, without interruption or degradation of performance. We may experience disruptions, data loss, outages and other performance problems with our infrastructure due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure and functionality changes, human or software errors, capacity constraints or security-related incidents. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems immediately or in short order. We may not be able to maintain the level of service uptime and performance required by our customers, especially during peak usage times and as\n \nour products become more complex and our user traffic increases. If our platform is unavailable or if our customers are unable to access our products or deploy them within a reasonable amount of time, or at all, our business would be harmed. Since our customers rely on our service to access and complete their work, any outage on our platform would impair the ability of our customers to perform their work, which would negatively impact our brand, reputation and customer satisfaction.\u00a0Moreover, we depend on services from various third parties to maintain our infrastructure and distribute our products via the internet. If a service provider fails to provide sufficient capacity to support our platform or otherwise experiences service outages, such failure could interrupt our customers\u2019 access to our service, which could adversely affect their perception of our platform's reliability and our revenues. Any disruptions in these services, including as a result of actions outside of our control, would significantly impact the continued performance of our products. In the future, these services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of these services could result in decreased functionality of our products until equivalent technology is either developed by us or, if available from another provider, is identified, obtained and \n29\nintegrated into our infrastructure. If we do not accurately predict our infrastructure capacity requirements, our customers could experience service shortfalls. We may also be unable to effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed, and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology.\nAny of the above circumstances or events may harm our reputation, cause customers to terminate their agreements with us, impair our ability to obtain subscription renewals from existing customers, impair our ability to grow our customer base, result in the expenditure of significant financial, technical and engineering resources, subject us to financial penalties and liabilities under our service level agreements, and otherwise harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAn application, data security or network incident may allow unauthorized access to our systems or data or our customers\u2019 data, disable access to our service, harm our reputation, create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results.\nIncreasingly, companies are subject to a wide variety of attacks on their systems and networks on an ongoing basis. In addition to threats from traditional computer \u201chackers,\u201d malicious code (such as malware, viruses, worms and ransomware), employee or contractor theft or misuse, password spraying, phishing and denial-of-service attacks, we and our third-party service providers now also face threats from sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors who engage in attacks (including advanced persistent threat intrusions) that add to the risks to our systems (including those hosted on AWS or other cloud services), internal networks, our customers\u2019 systems and the information that they store and process. For example, like other companies, we have experienced numerous cybersecurity attacks and have had to expend increasing amounts of human and financial capital to respond. We expect that these cybersecurity attacks will continue and that the scope and sophistication of these efforts may increase in future periods. Despite significant efforts to create security barriers to such threats, it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate these risks. As a well-known provider of identity and security solutions, we pose an attractive target for such attacks. The security measures we have integrated into our internal systems and platform, which are designed to detect unauthorized activity and prevent or minimize security breaches, may not function as expected or may not be sufficient to protect our internal networks and platform against certain attacks. In addition, techniques used to sabotage or to obtain unauthorized access to networks in which data is stored or through which data is transmitted change frequently, become more complex over time and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. As a result, we and our third-party service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures quickly enough to prevent either an electronic intrusion into our systems or services or a compromise of customer data, employee data or other protected information.\nOur customers\u2019 use of Okta to access business systems and store data concerning, among others, their employees, contractors, partners and customers is essential to their use of our platform, which stores, transmits and processes customers\u2019 proprietary information and personal data. If a breach of customer data on our platform were to occur, as a result of\u00a0third-party\u00a0action, technology limitations, employee or contractor error, malfeasance or otherwise, and the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our customers\u2019 data or systems was disrupted, we could incur significant liability to our customers and to individuals or businesses whose information was being stored by our customers, and our platform may be perceived as less desirable, which could negatively affect our business and damage our reputation. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we, our third-party service providers and our customers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. Further, because we do not control our third-party service providers, or the processing of data by our third-party service providers, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of measures they take to protect customer information and prevent data loss.\nIn addition, security breaches impacting our platform could result in a risk of loss or unauthorized disclosure of this information, or the denial of access to this information, which, in turn, could lead to enforcement actions, litigation, regulatory or governmental audits, investigations and possible liability, and increased requests by individuals regarding their personal data. Security breaches could also damage our relationships with and ability to attract customers and partners, and trigger service availability, indemnification and other contractual obligations. Security incidents may also cause us to incur significant investigation, mitigation, remediation, notification and other expenses. Furthermore, as a well-known provider of identity and security solutions, any such breach, including a breach of our customers\u2019 systems, could compromise systems secured by our products, creating system disruptions or slowdowns and exploiting security vulnerabilities of our or our customers\u2019 systems, and the information stored on our or our customers\u2019 systems could be accessed, publicly disclosed, altered, lost or stolen, which could subject us \n30\nto liability and cause us financial harm. For example, in December 2021, a third party reported a remote code execution vulnerability in the Java logging library known as \u201clog4j\u201d that affected many systems worldwide. We have reviewed the use of this library within our software product portfolio and in our IT environment and have taken steps to mitigate the vulnerability. There is no guarantee that our preventative and mitigation actions with respect to this vulnerability and others like it will fully eliminate the risk of a malicious compromise of our or our customers\u2019 systems.\nWhile we maintain cybersecurity insurance, our insurance may be insufficient to cover all liabilities incurred in these incidents, and any incidents may result in loss of, or increased costs of, our cybersecurity insurance.\n \nThese breaches, or any perceived breach, of our systems, our customers\u2019 systems, or other systems or networks secured by our products, whether or not any such breach is due to a vulnerability in our platform, may also undermine confidence in our platform or our industry and result in damage to our reputation and brand, negative publicity, loss of ISVs and other channel partners, customers and sales, increased costs to remedy any problem, costly litigation and other liability. In addition, a breach of the security measures of one of our key ISVs or other channel partners could result in the exfiltration of confidential corporate information or other data that may provide additional avenues of attack, and if a high profile security breach occurs with respect to a comparable cloud technology provider, our customers and potential customers may lose trust in the security of the cloud business model generally, which could adversely impact our ability to retain existing customers or attract new ones, potentially causing a negative impact on our business. Any of these negative outcomes could adversely impact market acceptance of our products and could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThird parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, contractors, customers or our customers\u2019 users into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information or otherwise compromise the security of our internal networks, electronic systems and/or physical facilities in order to gain access to our data or our customers\u2019 data, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure, a loss of confidence in the security of our platform, interruptions or malfunctions in our operations, account lock outs, and, ultimately, harm to our future business prospects and revenue. We may be required to expend significant capital and financial resources to protect against such threats or to alleviate problems caused by breaches in security.\nAny actual or perceived failure by us to comply with the privacy or security provisions of our privacy policy,\n \nour contracts and/or legal or regulatory requirements could result in proceedings, actions or penalties against us.\nOur customers\u2019 storage and use of data concerning, among others, their employees, contractors, partners and customers is essential to their use of our platform. We have implemented various features intended to enable our customers to better comply with applicable privacy and security requirements in their collection and use of data within our online service, but these features do not ensure their compliance and may not be effective against all potential privacy or related regulatory concerns.\nMany jurisdictions have enacted or are considering enacting or revising privacy and/or data security legislation, including laws and regulations applying to the collection, use, storage, transfer, disclosure and/or processing of personal data. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws and regulations that are applicable to the operations of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it. These privacy and data security related laws and regulations are evolving and may result in increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. In addition, we are subject to certain contractual obligations regarding the collection, use, storage, transfer, disclosure and/or processing of personal data. Although we are working to comply with those federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations and other legal obligations that apply to us, those laws, regulations, standards and obligations are evolving and may be modified, interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, and may conflict with one another, other requirements or legal obligations, our practices or the features of our platform. In addition, some of our customers rely on our authorization under FedRAMP to help satisfy their own legal and regulatory compliance requirements which, in addition to state or international regulations, may require us to undertake additional actions and expense to ensure compliance.\nWe also expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations, self-regulatory and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the United States, China, the European Union and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) took effect on January 1, 2020, which broadly defines personal information and gives California residents expanded privacy rights and protections and provides for civil penalties for violations and a private right of action for data breaches. In addition, \n31\non November 3, 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d) into law. The CPRA will take substantial effect on January 1, 2023 with enforcement scheduled for July 1, 2023 and will significantly modify the CCPA and create a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA. Since the CPRA passed, in March 2021, Virginia enacted the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (\u201cCDPA\u201d) and, in June 2021, Colorado enacted the Colorado Privacy Act (\u201cCPA\u201d), both of which are comprehensive privacy statutes that share similarities with the CCPA and CPRA. Some observers have noted the CCPA, CPRA, CDPA and CPA mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States, including a potential federal privacy law, all of which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business. Additionally, in August 2021, the National People\u2019s Congress of the People's Republic of China adopted the Personal Information Protection Law (\u201cPIPL\u201d), which took effect on November 1, 2021. The PIPL, which introduces a legal framework similar to the GDPR (as defined and further described below), marks the introduction of a comprehensive system for the protection of personal information in China. We cannot yet determine the impact that the PIPL may have on our business; however, we may incur substantial expense in complying with any new obligations, we could be subject to significant fines if we are found to not comply with the PIPL, and we may be required to make significant changes in our business operations and product and services development, all of which may adversely affect our revenues and our business overall.\nFuture laws, regulations, standards and other obligations, and changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations, standards and other obligations could impair our or our customers\u2019 ability to collect, use or disclose information relating to consumers, which could decrease demand for our applications, restrict our business operations, or increase our costs and impair our ability to maintain and grow our customer base and increase our revenue. Such laws and regulations may require companies to implement privacy and security policies, permit users to exercise various data rights, inform individuals of security breaches that affect their personal data, and, in some cases, obtain individuals\u2019 consent to use personal data for certain purposes. If we, or the third parties on which we rely, fail to comply with federal, state and international data privacy laws and regulations our ability to successfully operate our business and pursue our business goals could be harmed.\nWith respect to cybersecurity in the United States, we are closely monitoring the development of rules and guidance pursuant to various executive orders that may apply to us, including, for example, pursuant to Executive Order 14028 for \u201ccritical software.\u201d While the rules and guidance coming from the Order are still being developed, we could be categorized as a provider of critical software, which may increase our compliance costs and delay or prevent our ability to execute contracts with customers, including in particular with government entities.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us to comply with federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations, compliance frameworks that Okta has contractually committed to comply with, or any actual or suspected privacy or security incident, even if unfounded, whether or not resulting in unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release or transfer of personal data or other data, may result in enforcement actions and prosecutions, private litigation, fines, penalties and censure, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, or adverse publicity and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. \nWe publicly post our privacy policies and practices concerning our processing, use and disclosure of the personal data provided to us by our website visitors and by our customers, and other individuals with whom we interact. Our publication of our privacy policies and other statements we publish that provide promises and assurances about privacy and security can subject us to potential state and federal action if they are found to be unfair, deceptive or misrepresentative of our practices.\nIf our platform is perceived to cause, or is otherwise unfavorably associated with, violations of privacy or data security requirements, it may subject us or our customers to public criticism and potential legal liability. Existing and potential privacy laws and regulations concerning privacy and data security and increasing sensitivity of consumers to unauthorized processing of personal data may create negative public reactions to technologies, products and services such as ours. Public concerns regarding personal data processing, privacy and security may cause some of our customers\u2019 end users to be less likely to visit their websites or otherwise interact with them. If enough end users choose not to visit our customers\u2019 websites or otherwise interact with them, our customers could stop using our platform. This, in turn, may reduce the value of our service, and slow or eliminate the growth of our business, or cause our business to contract.\nWe may face particular privacy, data security and data protection risks in Europe due to stringent data protection and privacy laws, including the European General Data Protection Regulation, and increased scrutiny over EU-U.S. data transfers.\n32\nWe are subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (\u201cGDPR\u201d) that took effect on May 25, 2018, and, as a result of the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union, as of January 1, 2021, the UK General Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Act 2018 (\u201cUK Data Protection Laws\u201d). The GDPR and UK Data Protection Laws have enhanced data protection obligations for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal data is to be used, limitations on retention of information, mandatory data breach notification requirements and onerous new obligations on services providers. Non-compliance with the GDPR can trigger fines of up to \u20ac20 million, or 4% of total worldwide annual revenue, whichever is higher. The UK Data Protection Laws mirror the fines under the GDPR. Given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, complying with its requirements has caused us to expend significant resources and such expenditures are likely to continue into the near future as we respond to new interpretations and enforcement actions following the effective date of the regulation and as we continue to negotiate data processing agreements with our customers and business partners. Separate EU laws and regulations (and member states\u2019 implementations of them) govern the protection of consumers and of electronic communications and these are also evolving. A draft of the new ePrivacy Regulation extends the strict opt-in marketing rules with limited exceptions to business-to-business communications, alters rules on third-party cookies, web beacons and similar technology and significantly increases penalties. We cannot yet determine the impact that such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. Such laws and regulations are often subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. We may incur substantial expense in complying with any new obligations and we may be required to make significant changes in our business operations and product and services development, all of which may adversely affect our revenues and our business overall.\nIn addition, the GDPR restricts transfers outside of the EU to third countries deemed to lack adequate privacy protections (such as the United States), unless an appropriate safeguard specified by the GDPR is implemented, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses (\u201cSCCs\u201d) approved by the European Commission and, until July 16, 2020, the Privacy Shield for EU-U.S. data transfers. With regard to transfers to the United States of personal data from our employees and European customers and users, we rely upon the SCCs. On July 16, 2020, in what is known as the \u201cSchrems II\u201d decision, the Court of Justice of the European Union (\u201cCJEU\u201d) invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (\u201cPrivacy Shield\u201d) under which personal data could be transferred from the EEA to U.S. entities who had self-certified under the Privacy Shield scheme. While the CJEU upheld the adequacy of the SCCs (a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism, and potential alternative to the Privacy Shield), it made clear that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances. Use of the SCCs must now be assessed on a case-by-case basis taking into account the legal regime applicable in the destination country, in particular applicable surveillance laws and rights of individuals and additional measures and/or contractual provisions may need to be put in place. The European Commission has now issued new SCCs that account for the CJEU\u2019s \u201cSchrems II\u201d decision. Although we believe we continue to satisfy regulatory requirements through our use of SCCs, these latest developments may require major changes to our data transfer policy, including the need to conduct legal, technical, and security assessments for each data transfer from the EEA to a country outside of the EEA. This means that we may be unsuccessful in maintaining legitimate means for our transfer and receipt of personal data from the EEA. We may, in addition to other impacts, experience additional costs associated with increased compliance burdens, and we and our customers face the potential for regulators in the EEA to apply different standards to the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the United States, and to block, or require ad hoc verification of measures taken with respect to, certain data flows from the EEA to the United States. We also anticipate being required to engage in new contract negotiations with third parties that aid in processing data on our behalf, and entering into the new SCCs. We may experience reluctance or refusal by current or prospective European customers to use our products, and we may find it necessary or desirable to make further changes to our handling of personal data of EEA residents. There are few viable alternatives to the SCCs, and the law in this area remains dynamic. These recent developments will require us to review and may require us to amend the legal mechanisms by which we make and/or receive personal data transfers to/in the United States. \nThe regulatory environment applicable to the handling of EEA residents' personal data, and our actions taken in response, may cause us to assume additional liabilities or incur additional costs and could result in our business, operating results and financial condition being harmed. We and our customers may face a risk of enforcement actions by data protection authorities in the EEA relating to personal data transfers to us and by us from the EEA. Any such enforcement actions could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, distract management and technical personnel and negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe also continue to see jurisdictions imposing data localization laws, which require personal information, or certain subcategories of personal information to be stored in the jurisdiction of origin. These regulations may deter \n33\ncustomers from using cloud-based services such as ours, and may inhibit our ability to expand into those markets or prohibit us from continuing to offer services in those markets without significant additional costs.\nWe and our customers are at risk of enforcement actions taken by certain EU data protection authorities until such point in time that we may be able to ensure that all transfers of personal data to us in the United States from the EU are conducted in compliance with all applicable regulatory obligations, the guidance of data protection authorities and evolving best practices. Any investigation or charges by EU data protection authorities could have a negative effect on our existing business and on our ability to attract and retain new customers. We may find it necessary to establish systems to maintain EU personal data within the EU, which may involve substantial expense and may cause us to need to divert resources from other aspects of our business, all of which may adversely affect our business.\nWe function as a HIPAA Business Associate for certain of our customers and, as such, are subject to strict privacy and data security requirements. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, we could be subject to significant liability, all of which can adversely affect our business as well as our ability to attract and retain new customers. \nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (\u201cHITECH\u201d), and their respective implementing regulations under HIPAA, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA\u2019s security standards directly applicable to business associates. We function as a business associate for certain of our customers that are HIPAA covered entities and service providers, and in that context we are regulated as a business associate for the purposes of HIPAA. The HIPAA-covered entities and service providers to which we provide services require us to enter into HIPAA-compliant business associate agreements with them. These agreements impose stringent data security obligations on us. If we are unable to comply with our obligations as a HIPAA business associate or under the terms of the business associate agreements we have executed, we could face substantial civil and even criminal liability as well as contractual liability under the applicable business associate agreement, all of which can have an adverse impact on our business and generate negative publicity, which, in turn, can have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain new customers. Modifying the already stringent penalty structure that was present under HIPAA prior to HITECH, HITECH created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from HIPAA and each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect.\nIn addition, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services recently proposed modifications to the HIPAA privacy regulations (\u201cPrivacy Rule\u201d), including certain changes designed to strengthen individuals\u2019 right to access their own health information, improve information sharing for care coordination and case management, and reduce administrative burdens on HIPAA covered entities, while continuing to protect individuals\u2019 health information privacy interests. The proposed rulemaking has not yet been finalized. We will continue to monitor whether any final modifications to the Privacy Rule may obligate us to change our practices. Significant changes to HIPAA, including interpretation and application of HIPAA, could negatively impact our business.\nWe provide service level commitments under our customer contracts. If we fail to meet these contractual commitments, we could be obligated to provide credits for future service, or face contract termination with refunds of prepaid amounts related to unused subscriptions, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. \nOur customer agreements contain service level commitments, under which we guarantee specified availability of our platform. Any failure of or disruption to our infrastructure could make our platform unavailable to our customers. If we are unable to meet the stated service level commitments to our customers or suffer extended periods of unavailability of our platform, we may be contractually obligated to provide affected customers with service credits for future subscriptions. Our revenue, other results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we suffer unscheduled downtime that exceeds the service level commitments under our agreements with our customers, and any extended service outages could adversely affect our business and reputation as customers may elect not to renew and we could lose future sales.\n34\nIf we are unable to ensure that our products integrate or interoperate with a variety of operating systems and software applications that are developed by others, our platform may become less competitive and our results of operations may be harmed. \nThe number of people who access the internet through mobile devices and access cloud-based software applications through mobile devices, including smartphones and handheld tablets or laptop computers, has increased significantly in the past several years and is expected to continue to increase. While we have created mobile applications and mobile versions of our products, if these mobile applications and products do not perform well, our business may suffer.\u00a0We are also dependent on third-party application stores that may prevent us from timely updating our current products or uploading new products. In addition, our products interoperate with servers, mobile devices and software applications predominantly through the use of protocols, many of which are created and maintained by third parties.\u00a0As a result, we depend on the interoperability of our products with such third-party services, mobile devices and mobile operating systems, as well as cloud-enabled hardware, software, networking, browsers, database technologies and protocols that we do not control. Any changes in such technologies that degrade the functionality of our products or give preferential treatment to competitive services could adversely affect adoption and usage of our platform.\u00a0Also, we may not be successful in developing or maintaining relationships with key participants in the mobile industry or in developing products that operate effectively with a range of operating systems, networks, devices, browsers, protocols and standards.\u00a0In addition, we may face different fraud, security and regulatory risks from transactions sent from mobile devices than we do from personal computers.\u00a0If we are unable to effectively anticipate and manage these risks, or if it is difficult for our customers to access and use our platform, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be harmed.\nOur success also depends on the willingness of third-party developers and technology providers to build applications and provide integrations that are complementary to our service. Without the development of these applications and integrations, both current and potential customers may not find our service sufficiently attractive, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer.\nInterruptions or delays in the services provided by third-party data centers or internet service providers could impair the delivery of our platform and our business could suffer. \nWe rely on a number of third-party service providers to operate our services, any of which, if it encountered interruptions or delays, could negatively affect our platform, damage our reputation, expose us to liability, cause us to lose customers or otherwise harm our business. For example, we host our platform using AWS data centers and other third-party cloud infrastructure services. All of our products use resources operated by us in these locations. Our operations depend on protecting the virtual cloud infrastructure hosted in AWS or other cloud services by maintaining its configuration, architecture and interconnection specifications, as well as the information stored in these virtual data centers and which third-party internet service providers transmit. Although we have disaster recovery plans that use multiple virtual data center locations, any incident affecting their infrastructure that may be caused by fire, flood, severe storm, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failures, unauthorized intrusion, computer viruses and disabling devices, natural disasters, war, criminal act, military actions, terrorist attacks and other similar events beyond our control could negatively affect our platform. A prolonged third-party service disruption affecting our platform for any of the foregoing reasons could be detrimental to our business. We may also incur significant costs for using alternative equipment or taking other actions in preparation for, or in reaction to, events that damage the third-party services we use.\nOur cloud infrastructure services enable us to order and reserve server capacity in varying amounts and sizes distributed across multiple regions. These cloud infrastructure services provide us with computing and storage capacity pursuant to agreements which may be terminated under specified circumstances.\nOur platform is accessed by a large number of customers, often at the same time. As we continue to expand the number of our customers and products available to our customers, we may not be able to scale our technology to accommodate the increased capacity requirements, which may result in interruptions or delays in service. In addition, the failure of third-party virtual data centers, or third-party internet service providers, or other third-party service providers whose services are integrated with our platform, to meet our capacity requirements could result in interruptions or delays in access to our platform or impede our ability to scale our operations. In the event that our third-party service agreements are terminated, or there is a lapse of service, interruption of internet service provider connectivity or damage to such facilities, we could experience interruptions in access to our platform as well as delays and additional expense in arranging new facilities and services.\n35\nOur success depends, in part, on the integrity and scalability of our systems and infrastructures. System interruption and the lack of integration, redundancy and scalability in these systems and infrastructures may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. \nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the integrity of our systems and infrastructure, including websites, information and related systems. System interruption and a lack of integration and redundancy in our information systems and infrastructure may adversely affect our ability to operate websites, process and fulfill transactions, respond to customer inquiries and generally maintain cost-efficient operations. We may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all systems or data unavailable or prevent us from efficiently providing access to our platform. We also rely on third-party computer systems, broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with providing access to our platform generally. Any interruptions, outages or delays in our systems and infrastructure, our business and/or third parties, or deterioration in the performance of these systems and infrastructure, could impair our ability to provide access to our platform. Fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, other natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer, broadband or other communications systems and infrastructure at any time. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from providing access to our platform. While we have backup systems for certain aspects of these operations, disaster recovery planning by its nature cannot be sufficient for all eventualities. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption. If any of these events were to occur, it could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on software and services from other parties. Defects in or the loss of access to software or services from third parties could increase our costs and adversely affect the quality of our products. \nWe rely on technologies from third parties to operate critical functions of our business, including cloud infrastructure services and customer relationship management services. Our business would be disrupted if any of the third-party software or services we use, or functional equivalents, were unavailable due to extended outages or interruptions or because they are no longer available on commercially reasonable terms or prices. In each case, we would be required to either seek licenses to software or services from other parties and redesign our products to function with such software or services or develop substitutes ourselves, which would result in increased costs and could result in delays in our product launches and the release of new product offerings until equivalent technology can be identified, licensed or developed, and integrated into our products. Furthermore, we might be forced to limit the features available in our current or future products. These delays and feature limitations, if they occur, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nReal or perceived errors, failures, vulnerabilities or bugs in our products, including deployment complexity,\u00a0could harm our business and results of operations.\nErrors, failures, vulnerabilities or bugs may occur in our products, especially when updates are deployed or new products are rolled out. Our platform is often used in connection with large-scale\n \ncomputing environments with different operating systems, system management software, equipment and networking configurations, which may cause errors or failures of products, or other aspects of the computing environment into which our products are deployed. In addition, deployment of our products into complicated, large-scale computing environments may expose errors, failures, vulnerabilities or bugs in our products. Any such errors, failures, vulnerabilities or bugs may not be found until after they are deployed to our customers. Real or perceived errors, failures, vulnerabilities or bugs in our products, or delays in or difficulties implementing our product releases, could result in negative publicity, loss of customer data, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, a decrease in customer satisfaction or adoption rates, loss of competitive position, or claims by customers for losses sustained by them, all of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n36\nIf we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights, our competitive position could be impaired and we may lose valuable assets, generate less revenue and incur costly litigation to protect our rights. \nOur success is dependent, in part, upon protecting our proprietary information and technology. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate. We will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our products and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products that compete with ours. Some contract provisions protecting against unauthorized use, copying, transfer and disclosure of our products may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries. Further, the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries may be inadequate. To the extent we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our products and proprietary information may increase. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our technology and intellectual property.\nWe rely in part on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and other confidential information to maintain our competitive position.\u00a0Although we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with the parties with whom we have strategic relationships and business alliances, no assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our products and proprietary information. Further, these agreements do not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products.\nTo protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets. Such litigation could be costly, time consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, could delay further sales or the implementation of our products, impair the functionality of our products, delay introductions of new products, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our products, or injure our reputation. In addition, we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop and market new products, and we cannot ensure that we can license that technology on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and our inability to license this technology could harm our ability to compete.\nOur results of operations may be harmed if we are subject to an infringement claim or a claim that results in a significant damage award.\nThere is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity in our industry, and we expect that software companies will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. In addition, the patent portfolios of many of our competitors are larger than ours, and this disparity may increase the risk that our competitors may sue us for patent infringement and may limit our ability to counterclaim for patent infringement or settle through patent cross-licenses. Other companies have claimed in the past, and may claim in the future, that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights. A claim may also be made relating to technology that we acquire or license from third parties. Further, we may be unaware of the intellectual property rights of others that may cover some or all of our technology.\nAny claim of infringement, regardless of its merit or our defenses, could:\n\u2022\nrequire costly litigation to resolve and/or the payment of substantial damages, ongoing royalty payments or other amounts to settle such disputes;\n\u2022\nrequire significant management time and attention;\n\u2022\ncause us to enter into unfavorable royalty or license agreements, if such arrangements are available at all;\n37\n\u2022\nrequire us to discontinue the sale of some or all of our products, remove or reduce features or functionality of our products or comply with other unfavorable terms;\n\u2022\nrequire us to indemnify our customers or third-party service providers; and/or\n\u2022\nrequire us to expend additional development resources to redesign our products.\nAny one or more of the above could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe use open source software in our products, which could negatively affect our ability to offer our products and subject us to litigation or other actions.\nWe use open source software in our products and expect to use more open source software in the future. From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products. However, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our products. In addition, if we were to combine our proprietary software products with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain of the open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public. This would allow our competitors to create similar products with less development effort and time. If we inappropriately use open source software, or if the license terms for open source software that we use change, we may be required to re-engineer our products, incur additional costs, discontinue the sale of some or all of our products or take other remedial actions.\nIn addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or assurance of title or controls on origin of the software. In addition, many of the risks associated with usage of open source software, such as the lack of warranties or assurances of title, cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. We have established processes to help alleviate these risks, including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source software, but we cannot be sure that all of our use of open source software is in a manner that is consistent with our current policies and procedures, or will not subject us to liability.\nIndemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses. \nOur agreements with customers and other third parties may include indemnification or other provisions under which we agree to indemnify or otherwise be liable to them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement, damages caused by us to property\n \nor persons, or other liabilities relating to or arising from the use of our platform or other acts or omissions. The term of these contractual provisions often survives termination or expiration of the applicable agreement. As we continue to grow, the possibility of infringement claims and other intellectual property rights claims against us may increase. For any intellectual property rights indemnification claim against us or our customers, we will incur significant legal expenses and may have to pay damages, settlement fees, license fees and/or stop using technology found to be in violation of the third party\u2019s rights. Large indemnity payments could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\u00a0We may also have to seek a license for the infringing or allegedly infringing technology. Such license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and may significantly increase our operating expenses or may require us to restrict our business activities and limit our ability to deliver certain products. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative\u00a0non-infringing\u00a0technology, which could require significant effort and expense and/or cause us to alter our platform, which could negatively affect our business.\nFrom time to time, customers require us to indemnify or otherwise be liable to them for breach of confidentiality, violation of applicable law or failure to implement adequate security measures with respect to their data stored, transmitted, or accessed using our platform. Although we normally contractually limit our liability with respect to such obligations, the existence of such a dispute may have adverse effects on our customer relationship and reputation and we may still incur substantial liability related to them.\n38\nAny assertions by a third party, whether or not successful, with respect to such indemnification obligations could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation, expensive remediation and licenses, divert management attention and financial resources, harm our relationship with that customer and other current and prospective customers, reduce demand for our platform, and harm our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Legal, Accounting and Tax Matters\nBecause we generally recognize revenue from our subscriptions and support services over the term of the relevant service period, a decrease in sales during a reporting period may not be immediately reflected in our results of operations for that period. \nWe generally recognize revenue from subscriptions and related support services revenue ratably over the relevant service period. Net new revenue from new subscriptions, upsells and renewals entered into during a period can generally be expected to generate revenue for the duration of the service period. As a result, most of the revenue we report in each period is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscriptions and support services contracts entered into during previous periods. Consequently, a decrease in new or renewed subscriptions in any single reporting period will have a limited impact on our revenue for that period. In addition, our ability to adjust our cost structure in the event of a decrease in new or renewed subscriptions may be limited.\nFurther, a decline in new subscriptions or renewals in a given period may not be fully reflected in our revenue for that period, but will negatively affect our revenue in future periods. Accordingly, the effect\n \nof significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services, and changes in our rate of renewals, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers is generally recognized over the applicable service period. Additionally, due to the complexity of certain of our customer contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, \nRevenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\n, will depend on contract-specific terms and may result in greater variability in revenue from period to period.\nIn addition, a decrease in new subscriptions or renewals in a reporting period may not have an immediate impact on billings for that period.\nWe may face exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nToday, a vast majority of our customer contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars. Over time, however, an increasing portion of our international customer contracts may be denominated in local currencies. In addition, the majority of our international costs are denominated in local currencies. As a result, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may affect our results of operations when translated into U.S. dollars. We do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. However, in the future, we may use derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. Moreover, the use of hedging instruments may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery and similar laws, and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal penalties or significant fines and harm our business and reputation. \nWe are subject to anti-corruption and anti-bribery and similar laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 and other anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees and agents from promising, authorizing, making or offering improper payments or other benefits to government officials and others in the private sector. As we increase our international sales and business, our risks under these laws may increase.\nIn addition, we use channel partners to sell our products and conduct business on our behalf abroad. We or such partners may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-\n39\nowned or affiliated entities and under certain circumstances we could be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of such partners, and our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. We have implemented an anti-corruption compliance program but cannot ensure that all our employees and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible.\nNoncompliance with the FCPA, other applicable anti-corruption laws, or anti-money laundering laws could subject us to investigations, whistleblower complaints, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, and other enforcement actions. Any violation of these laws could result in disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, adverse media coverage, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts and other consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to governmental export controls and economic sanctions laws that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws.\nOur business activities are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export controls and trade and economic sanctions laws, including the U.S. Commerce Department\u2019s Export Administration Regulations and economic and trade sanctions regulations maintained by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control. The U.S. export control laws and U.S. economic sanctions laws include prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons and entities and also require authorization for the export of encryption items.\u00a0In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our service or could limit our customers\u2019 ability to implement our service in those countries.\u00a0If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export privileges and monetary penalties. Obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular transaction may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed, and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Although we take precautions to prevent our products from being provided in violation of such laws, our products may have been in the past, and could in the future be, provided inadvertently in violation of such laws, despite the precautions we take. This could result in negative consequences to us, including government investigations, penalties and harm to our reputation.\nOur international operations may give rise to potentially adverse tax consequences. \nWe are expanding our international operations and staff to better support our growth into the international markets. Our corporate structure and associated transfer pricing policies anticipate future growth into the international markets. The amount of taxes we pay in different jurisdictions may depend on the application of the tax laws of the various jurisdictions, including the United States, to our international business activities, changes in tax rates, new or revised tax laws or interpretations of existing tax laws and policies and our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for pricing intercompany transactions, which are generally required to be computed on an arm\u2019s-length basis pursuant to intercompany arrangements or disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a challenge or disagreement were to occur, and our position was not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability of our operations. Our financial statements could fail to reflect adequate reserves to cover such a contingency.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations in the various tax jurisdictions we are subject to that are applied adversely to us or our customers could increase the costs of our products and harm our business. \nNew income, sales, use, value-added or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time. Those enactments could harm our domestic and international business operations, and our business and financial performance. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. These events could require us or our customers to pay additional tax amounts on a prospective or retroactive basis, as well as require us or our customers to pay fines and/or penalties and interest for past amounts deemed to be due. If we raise our prices to offset the costs of these changes, existing and potential future customers may elect not to purchase our products in the future. Additionally, \n40\nnew, changed, modified or newly interpreted or applied tax laws could increase our customers\u2019 and our compliance, operating and other costs, as well as the costs of our products. Further, these events could decrease the capital we have available to operate our business. Any or all of these events could harm our business and financial performance. For example, various legislative and regulatory actions and proposals, such as in the United States, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the EU, have increasingly focused on future tax reform and contemplate changes to long-standing tax principles, which could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.\nAs a multinational organization, we may be subject to taxation in certain jurisdictions around the world with increasingly complex tax laws, the application of which can be uncertain. The amount of taxes we pay in these jurisdictions could increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents, which could harm our liquidity and results of operations. In addition, the authorities in these jurisdictions could review our tax returns and impose additional tax, interest and penalties, and the authorities could claim that various withholding requirements apply to us or our subsidiaries or assert that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us or our subsidiaries, any of which could harm us and our results of operations.\nOur business may be subject to additional obligations to collect and remit sales tax and other taxes, and we may be subject to tax liability for past sales. Any successful action by state, foreign or other authorities to collect additional or past sales tax could harm our business. \nState, foreign and local taxing jurisdictions have differing rules and regulations governing sales, use and other indirect taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. In particular, the applicability of sales and value-added taxes to our platform in various jurisdictions is unclear. It is possible that we could face tax audits and that our liability for these taxes could exceed our estimates as tax authorities could still assert that we are obligated to collect additional amounts as taxes from our customers and remit those taxes to those authorities. We could also be subject to audits in states and international jurisdictions for which we have not accrued tax liabilities. A successful assertion that we should be collecting additional sales or other taxes on our service in jurisdictions where we have not historically done so and do not accrue for such taxes could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, discourage customers from purchasing our products or otherwise harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe file sales tax returns in certain states within the United States as required by law and certain customer contracts for a portion of the products that we provide. We do not collect sales or other similar taxes in other states and many of such states do not apply sales or similar taxes to the vast majority of the products that we provide. However, one or more states or foreign authorities could seek to impose additional sales, use or other tax collection and record-keeping obligations on us or may determine that such taxes should have, but have not been, paid by us. Liability for past taxes may also include substantial interest and penalty charges. Any successful action by state, foreign or other authorities to compel us to collect and remit sales tax, use tax or other taxes, either retroactively, prospectively or both, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to use our U.S. net operating loss carry-forwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. \nUnder Section\u00a0382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carry-forwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits and distributed interest deduction carryover, to offset its post-change income may be limited.\u00a0We have experienced ownership changes in the past and any such ownership change in the future could result in increased future tax liability. In addition, we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carry-forwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.\nOn March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) which included temporary relief from the net operating loss limitations imposed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2021, and made certain technical corrections to applying the net operating loss utilization limitations for tax years beginning after January 1, 2021.    \n41\nOur ability to use our net operating losses is conditioned upon generating future U.S. federal taxable income. Since we do not know whether or when we will generate the U.S. federal taxable income necessary to use our remaining net operating losses, these net operating loss carryforwards generated prior to our tax year ended January 31, 2018 could expire unused.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired. \nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight.\u00a0If any of these new or improved controls and systems do not perform as expected, we may experience material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our controls.\nOur controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to maintain effective controls could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our periodic reports that are filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the Nasdaq. We are required to provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually. Our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and results of operations and could cause a decline in the price of our Class A common stock.\nChanges in existing financial accounting standards or practices, or taxation rules or practices, may harm our results of operations. \nChanges in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices, new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules, or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practice could harm our results of operations or the manner in which we conduct our business. Further, such changes could potentially affect our reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective.\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. Adoption of such new standards and any difficulties in implementation of changes in accounting principles, including the ability to modify our accounting systems, could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could result in regulatory discipline and harm investors\u2019 confidence in us.\n42\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could be adversely affected. \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with\u00a0GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to those related to the valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets arising from business combinations, revenue recognition, period of benefit for deferred commissions, incremental borrowing rates for operating leases, effective interest rates for convertible notes, valuation of deferred income taxes and valuation of certain equity awards assumed. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe stock price of our Class A common stock may be volatile or may decline.\nPrior to our IPO, there was no public market for shares of our Class\u00a0A common stock. The market prices of the securities of other newly public companies have historically been highly volatile, and our stock price has been volatile since our IPO. The market price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\noverall performance of the equity markets and/or publicly-listed technology companies;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue or other financial or operating metrics;\n\u2022\nchanges in the financial projections we provide to the public or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022\nfailure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates and/or recommendations by any securities analysts who follow our company;\n\u2022\nour failure to meet the estimates or the expectations of securities analysts or investors;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nsignificant security breaches, technical difficulties or interruptions of our service;\n\u2022\nthe economy as a whole and market conditions in our industry;\n\u2022\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, or responses to these events; and\n\u2022\nsales of additional shares of our Class A common stock by us, our directors, our officers or our stockholders.\nIn addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. Stock prices of many companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to \n43\nbecome involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and harm our business.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our capital stock prior to the completion of our IPO, including our directors, executive officers, and their affiliates, who held in the aggregate 42.6% of the voting power of our capital stock as of January\u00a031, 2022. This will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval.\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of January\u00a031, 2022, our directors, executive officers and their affiliates held in the aggregate 42.6% of the voting power of our capital stock. Because of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively could continue to control nearly a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and be able to effectively control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval until April 12, 2027, the date that is the ten year anniversary of the closing of our IPO. This concentrated control may limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents,\n \nand any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval. In addition, this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.\nFuture transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who have retained their shares.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock in the public markets, or the perception that sales might occur, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline. \nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock into the public market, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders, or the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nIn addition, we have options outstanding that, if fully exercised, would result in the issuance of shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. We also have restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) outstanding that, if vested and settled, would result in the issuance of shares of Class A common stock. All of the shares of Class A and Class\u00a0B common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options and vesting of RSUs and the shares reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans, are registered for public resale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d). Accordingly, these shares will be able to be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to applicable vesting requirements.\nFurthermore, a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock is reserved for issuance upon the exercise of the Notes (as defined below) and the Warrants (as defined below) issued at the time of the issuance of the 2023 Notes (as defined below). If we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation on the Notes solely in shares of our Class A common stock upon conversion of the notes, we will be required to deliver the shares of our Class A common stock, together with cash for any fractional share, on the second business day following the relevant conversion date.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, the price of our Class A common stock and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research on our company, the trading price for our Class A common stock would be negatively affected. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our Class A common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our Class A common stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us on a regular basis, demand for our Class A common stock could decrease, which might cause our Class A common stock price and trading volume to decline.\n44\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the operation of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their Class A common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current board of directors, and limit the market price of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022\nprovide that our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\npermit the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly-created directorships;\n\u2022\nrequire super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;\n\u2022\nprovide that only the Chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief Executive Officer, or a majority of our board of directors are authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide for a dual class common stock structure in which holders of our Class B common stock have the ability to effectively control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nMoreover, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations, and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for:\n\u2022\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u2022\nany action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws; or\n45\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Outstanding Convertible Notes\nServicing our debt may require a significant amount of cash.\u00a0We may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness.\nSince February 2018, we have issued convertible notes due in 2023 (\u201c2023 Notes\u201d), 2025 (\u201c2025 Notes\u201d) and 2026 (\u201c2026 Notes\u201d and together with the 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes, the \u201cNotes\u201d). Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance any future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. In addition, any of our future debt agreements may contain restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of our debt.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary for cash settlement upon conversion of the Notes or to repurchase the Notes for cash upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion of the Notes or to repurchase the Notes.\nHolders of the Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indentures governing their respective Notes) at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.\u00a0Upon conversion of the Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our Class A common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Notes being converted.\u00a0We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Notes surrendered or Notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture governing such notes or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Notes as required by such indenture would constitute a default under such indenture. A default under the indenture governing the Notes or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon conversions.\nIn addition, our indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have other important consequences.\u00a0For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general U.S. and worldwide economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\n\u2022\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt; \n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund acquisitions, for working capital and for other general corporate purposes; and\n46\n\u2022\nmake an acquisition of our company less attractive or more difficult.\nAny of these factors could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to our business and our ability to service or repay our indebtedness would increase.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of the Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes, as applicable, at any time during specified periods at their option.\u00a0If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our Class A common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. As disclosed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements, the conditional conversion features of the 2023 Notes were triggered as of January\u00a031, 2022, and the 2023 Notes are currently convertible at the option of the holders, in whole or in part, between February\u00a01, 2022 and April\u00a030, 2022. Whether the 2023 Notes will be convertible following such fiscal quarter will depend on the continued satisfaction of this condition or another conversion condition in the future. The conditional conversion features of the 2025 Notes were triggered as of January 31, 2021 and the 2025 Notes were convertible at the option of the holders between February 1, 2021 and April 30, 2021; however, as of January\u00a031, 2022, the conditions allowing holders of the 2025 Notes to convert were not met. From the date of issuance through January\u00a031, 2022, the conditions allowing holders of the 2026 Notes to convert were not met.\nIn addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital. The 2023 Notes were classified as current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of\u00a0January\u00a031, 2022.\nTransactions relating to our Notes may affect the value of our Class A common stock.\n \nThe conversion of some or all of the Notes would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering shares of our Class A common stock upon any conversion of such Notes. Our Notes may become in the future convertible at the option of their holders under certain circumstances. If holders of our Notes elect to convert their notes, we may settle our conversion obligation by delivering to them a significant number of shares of our Class A common stock, which would cause dilution to our existing stockholders.\nIn addition, in connection with the issuance of the 2023 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedges (\u201cNote Hedges\u201d) with certain financial institutions (the \u201c2023 Notes Option Counterparties\u201d). We also entered into warrant transactions with the 2023 Notes Option Counterparties pursuant to which we sold warrants for the purchase of our Class A common stock (\u201cWarrants\u201d). The Note Hedges are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our Class A common stock upon any conversion or settlement of the 2023 Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2023 Notes, as the case may be. The Warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price per share of our Class A common stock exceeds the strike price of any Warrants unless, subject to the terms of the Warrant transactions, we elect to cash settle the Warrants. Through  January\u00a031, 2022, Note Hedges corresponding to approximately 6.8 million shares have been terminated or settled. As of January\u00a031, 2022, Note Hedges giving us the option to purchase approximately 0.4\u00a0million shares (subject to adjustment) remained outstanding. Through January\u00a031, 2022, we have terminated Warrants corresponding to approximately 6.1 million shares. As of January\u00a031, 2022, Warrants to acquire up to approximately 1.0 million shares (subject to adjustment) remained outstanding.\nIn addition, in connection with the issuance of the 2025 Notes and 2026 Notes, we entered into capped call transactions (\u201cCapped Calls\u201d) with certain financial institutions (the 2025 Notes and 2026 Notes Capped Call Counterparties and together with the 2023 Notes Option Counterparties, the \u201cOption Counterparties\u201d). The Capped Calls are generally expected to reduce potential dilution to our Class A common stock upon any conversion or settlement of the 2025 Notes and 2026 Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2025 Notes and 2026 Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap.\n47\nFrom time to time, the Option Counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our Class A common stock and/or purchasing or selling our Class A common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Notes. This activity could cause a decrease in the market price of our Class A common stock.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results. \nUnder FASB Accounting Standards Codification 470-20,\u00a0\nDebt with Conversion and Other Options\n (\u201cASC 470-20\u201d), an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. ASC 470-20 requires the value of the conversion options of the Notes, representing the equity component, to be recorded as additional paid-in capital within stockholders\u2019 equity in our consolidated balance sheet and as a discount to the Notes, which reduces their initial carrying value. The carrying value of the Notes, net of the applicable discount recorded, will be accreted up to the principal amount of the Notes, as the case may be, from the issuance date until maturity, which will result in non-cash charges to interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, we will report lower net income or higher net loss in our financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current period\u2019s accretion of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our Class A common stock and the respective trading price of the Notes.\nAccounting standards in the future will result in changes to the current ASC 470-20 accounting model. The FASB issued an accounting standards update that eliminates the liability and equity component separation model for convertible debt instruments with a cash conversion feature. Among other potential impacts, this change is expected to reduce reported interest expense, increase reported net income or lower net loss and result in a reclassification of certain balance sheet amounts from stockholders' equity to liabilities as it relates to the Notes.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe depend on our executive officers and other key employees, and the loss of one or more of these employees or an inability to attract and retain other highly skilled employees could harm our business.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key employees. We rely on our leadership team in the areas of research and development, operations, security, marketing, sales, customer support, general and administrative functions, and on individual contributors in our research and development and operations functions. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. For example, our former Chief Financial Officer stepped down from his role in June 2021, and our current Chief Financial Officer served on an interim basis from June 2021 until his permanent appointment in January 2022. Such changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business.\u00a0We do not have employment agreements with our executive officers or other key personnel that require them to continue to work for us for any specified period and they could terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees, and any failure to have in place and execute an effective succession plan for key executives, could harm our business.\u00a0Changes in our executive management team may also cause disruptions in, and harm to, our business.\nIn addition, to execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for these personnel in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters is located, and in other locations where we maintain offices, is intense, especially for engineers experienced in designing and developing software and SaaS applications and experienced sales professionals. We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications, and may not be able to fill positions in the desired regions, or at all. Our efforts to attract new personnel may be compounded by intensified restriction on travel (including during the COVID-19 pandemic), changes to immigration policy or the availability of work visas. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees or we have breached their legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources. In addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines, it may harm our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be harmed.\n48\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our business.\nNatural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could harm our business. We have a large employee presence in San Francisco, California and the west coast of the United States contains active earthquake and wildfire zones which have the potential to disrupt our business. For example, in the fall of 2019 and 2020, PG&E shut off power to certain cities in the San Francisco Bay Area in order to reduce the risk of wildfires and this resulted in many of our employees being unable to work remotely. In the event of a major earthquake, hurricane or catastrophic event such as fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, vandalism, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack or health epidemic (including COVID-19), we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our application development, lengthy interruptions in our products, breaches of data security and loss of critical data, all of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the insurance we maintain may be insufficient to cover our losses resulting from disasters, cyber-attacks or other business interruptions, and any incidents may result in loss of, or increased costs of, such insurance.", "item7": ">Item 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\u00a0In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d under Part I, Item 1A\u00a0in this Annual Report on Form\u00a010-K. Our fiscal year ends January 31.\nOverview\nOkta is the leading independent identity provider. The Okta Identity Cloud is powered by our category-defining platform that enables our customers to securely connect the right people to the right technologies and services at the right time. Every day, thousands of organizations and millions of people use Okta to securely access a wide range of cloud, mobile and web applications, on-premises servers, application program interfaces, IT infrastructure providers and services from a multitude of devices. Developers leverage our platform to securely and efficiently embed identity into the software they build, allowing them to focus on their core mission. Employees and contractors sign into the Okta Identity Cloud to seamlessly and securely access the applications they need to do their most important work. Organizations use our platform to collaborate with their partners, and to provide their customers with more modern and secure experiences online and via mobile devices. Given the growth trends in the number of applications and cloud adoption, and the movement to remote workforces, identity is becoming the most critical layer of an organization\u2019s security. Our approach to identity allows our customers to simplify and efficiently scale their security infrastructures across internal IT systems and external customer facing applications.\nAs of January\u00a031, 2022, more than 15,000 customers across nearly every industry used the Okta Identity Cloud to secure and manage identities around the world. Our customers consist of leading global organizations ranging from the largest enterprises, to small and medium-sized businesses, universities, non-profits and government agencies. We also partner with leading application, IT infrastructure and security vendors through our Okta Integration Network. As of January\u00a031, 2022, we had over 7,000 integrations with these cloud, mobile and web applications and IT infrastructure and security vendors. \nWe employ a Software-as-a-Service (\"SaaS\") business model, and generate revenue primarily by selling multi-year subscriptions to our cloud-based offerings. We focus on acquiring and retaining our customers and increasing their spending with us through expanding the number of users who access the Okta Identity Cloud and up-selling additional products. We sell our products directly through our field and inside sales teams, as well as indirectly through our network of channel partners, including resellers, system integrators and other distribution partners. Our subscription fees include the use of our service and our technical support and management of our platform. We base subscription fees primarily on the products used and the number of users on our platform. We typically invoice customers in advance in annual installments for subscriptions to our platform.\nImpact of COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our future operational and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of COVID-19 and variants of concern, related public health measures, including vaccine mandates, the manufacture, distribution, efficacy and public acceptance of treatments and vaccines, and their impact on the macroeconomy, our current and prospective customers, employees and vendors. None of these impacts can be predicted with certainty.\nOur revenue is relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model, which constituted approximately 96% of total revenue for the year ended January\u00a031, 2022. Future growth may be impacted by longer sales cycles, which we have experienced, which in turn, could result in delays in deals closing, creating near-term headwinds for cash flow, remaining performance obligations (\u201cRPO\u201d) and billings growth as well as potential future impacts on revenue growth and other key metrics on a trailing basis. While we see risks associated with more highly impacted companies and industries, we are also seeing new interest from other organizations, driven by rapidly \n53\nchanging work and business environments. As workforces have transitioned to fully remote and hybrid work models, Zero Trust has become an increasingly important security model and identity an increasingly critical service. \nWe believe we will be able to continue to deliver our cloud-based platform and support to our customers, without compromising our employees\u2019 safety. For most of fiscal 2021, we established mandatory work-from-home procedures for our global office locations, and our employees had the necessary tools and technology to remain connected and productive. In addition, in fiscal 2021 we shifted our customer, employee and industry events, including our annual user conference to virtual-only formats, resulting in cost savings. We further experienced cost savings driven by reductions in employee-related expenses as our sales and marketing activities shifted primarily to an online-only sales format and our employees shifted to work-from-home procedures. In fiscal 2022, as the administration of vaccines increased, we reopened our offices to partial capacity, allowing our employees to voluntarily return and resumed some in-person sales and marketing activities. In fiscal 2023, we are shifting to hybrid in-person and virtual sales formats and experiences for future annual user conferences, and we expect our future costs to increase.\nSee Risk Factors for further discussion of the potential impact of COVID-19 and its related public health measures on our business.\nAcquisition of Auth0\nOn May\u00a03, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Auth0, Inc (\"Auth0\"). The acquisition date fair value, net of acquired cash and subject to final adjustments, was approximately $5,671.0 million, including approximately 19.2 million shares of our Class A common stock valued at $5,175.6 million, $257.0 million in cash, and assumed equity awards with an initial fair market value of $238.4 million. In addition, we issued unvested restricted stock valued at $332.1 million and assumed unvested equity and restricted cash awards valued at $430.2 million, which are subject to future vesting and will be recorded as expense over the period the services are provided. Approximately 5% of the total consideration was held back by us to secure the indemnification obligations of the Auth0 securityholders arising during the twelve months following the closing. The estimated transaction value of approximately $6,500.0 million includes restricted stock and assumed equity and restricted cash awards subject to future vesting and was based on the fixed conversion stock price specified in the Merger Agreement. Further, the estimated transaction value excludes the impact of cash acquired and other customary closing purchase price adjustments. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual  Report on Form 10-K.\nFinancial Information and Segments\nWe operate our business as one reportable segment. Our revenue has grown significantly. For the years ended January 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, our revenue was $1,300.2 million, $835.4 million and $586.1 million, respectively, representing a growth rate of 56% and 43%, respectively. For the years ended January 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we generated net losses of $848.4 million, $266.3 million and $208.9 million, respectively. Our accumulated deficit as of January\u00a031, 2022 was $1,815.9 million.\n54\nKey Business Metrics\u00a0\nWe review a number of operating and financial metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.\n\u00a0\nAs of January\u00a031,\n2022\n2021\n2020\n\u00a0\n(dollars in thousands)\nCustomers with annual contract value (\"ACV\") above $100,000 \n3,100\u00a0\n1,950\u00a0\n1,467\u00a0\nDollar-based net retention rate for the trailing 12 months ended\n124\u00a0\n%\n121\u00a0\n%\n119\u00a0\n%\nCurrent remaining performance obligations\n$\n1,350,534\u00a0\n$\n841,797\u00a0\n$\n592,309\u00a0\nRemaining performance obligations\n$\n2,694,262\u00a0\n$\n1,796,949\u00a0\n$\n1,209,659\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYear Ended January\u00a031,\n\u00a0\n2022\n2021\n2020\n\u00a0\n(in thousands)\nCalculated billings\n$\n1,718,289\u00a0\n$\n975,994\u00a0\n$\n703,558\u00a0\nTotal Customers and Number of Customers with Annual Contract Value Above $100,000\nAs of January\u00a031, 2022, we had over 15,000 customers on our platform. We believe that our ability to increase the number of customers on our platform is an indicator of our market penetration, the growth of our business, and our potential future business opportunities. Increasing awareness of our platform and capabilities, coupled with the mainstream adoption of cloud technology, has expanded the diversity of our customer base to include organizations of all sizes across all industries. Over time, larger customers have constituted a greater share of our total revenue, which has contributed to an increase in average revenue per customer. The number of customers who have greater than $100,000 in ACV with us was 3,100, 1,950 and 1,467 as of January\u00a031, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We expect this trend to continue as larger enterprises recognize the value of our platform and replace their legacy identity access management infrastructure. We define a customer as a separate and distinct buying entity, such as a company, an educational or government institution, or a distinct business unit of a large company that has an active contract with us or one of our partners to access our platform. For purposes of determining our customer count, we do not include customers that use our platform under self-service arrangements only.\nDollar-Based Net Retention Rate \nOur ability to generate revenue is dependent upon our ability to maintain our relationships with our customers and to increase their utilization of our platform. We believe we can achieve these goals by focusing on delivering value and functionality that enables us to both retain our existing customers and expand the number of users and products used within an existing customer. We assess our performance in this area by measuring our Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate. Our Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate measures our ability to increase revenue across our existing customer base through expansion of users and products associated with a customer as offset by churn and contraction in the number of users and/or products associated with a customer. \nOur Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate is based upon our ACV which is calculated based on the terms of that customer\u2019s contract and represents the total contracted annual subscription amount as of that period end. We calculate our Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate as of a period end by starting with the ACV from all customers as of twelve months prior to such period end (\"Prior Period ACV\"). We then calculate the ACV from these same customers as of the current period end (\"Current Period ACV\"). Current Period ACV includes any upsells and is net of contraction or churn over the trailing twelve months but excludes ACV from new customers in the current period. We then divide the Current Period ACV by the Prior Period ACV to arrive at our Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate. Our Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate is inclusive of ACV from self-service customers. \nOur strong Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate is primarily attributable to gross retention, an expansion of users and upselling additional products within our existing customers. Larger enterprises often implement a limited initial deployment of our platform before increasing their deployment on a broader scale. \n55\nRemaining Performance Obligations (RPO)\nRPO represent all future, non-cancelable, contracted revenue under our subscription contracts with customers that has not yet been recognized, inclusive of deferred revenue that has been invoiced and non-cancelable amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. Current RPO represents the portion of RPO expected to be recognized during the next 12 months. RPO fluctuates due to a number of factors, including the timing, duration and dollar amount of customer contracts.\nCalculated Billings \nCalculated Billings represent our total revenue plus the change in deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue, and less the change in unbilled receivables, net of acquired unbilled receivables, in the period.\u00a0Calculated Billings in any particular period reflect sales to new customers plus subscription renewals and upsells to existing customers, and represent amounts invoiced for subscription, support and professional services. We typically invoice customers in advance in annual installments for subscriptions to our platform. \nCalculated Billings increased 76% in the year ended January\u00a031, 2022 over the year ended January\u00a031, 2021. We implemented operational changes to our billings process in the year ended January\u00a031, 2022 pursuant to which we billed customers earlier than we would have under our historical billing practices. These changes had a favorable effect on billings in the year ended January\u00a031, 2022. Absent the impact of the billings process changes, Calculated Billings would have grown 60% year-over-year in the year ended January\u00a031, 2022. As our Calculated Billings continue to grow in absolute terms, we expect our Calculated Billings growth rate to trend down over time. See the section titled \u201cNon-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for additional information and a reconciliation of Calculated Billings to total revenue. \nComponents of Results of Operations \nRevenue \nSubscription Revenue.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Subscription revenue primarily consists of fees for access to and usage of our cloud-based platform and related support. Subscription revenue is driven primarily by the number of customers, the number of users per customer and the products used. We typically invoice customers in advance in annual installments for subscriptions to our platform. \nProfessional Services and Other\n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Professional services revenue includes fees from assisting customers in implementing and optimizing the use of our products. These services include application configuration, system integration and training services. \nWe generally invoice customers as the work is performed for time-and-materials arrangements, and up front for fixed fee arrangements. All professional services revenue is recognized as the services are performed. \nOverhead Allocation and Employee Compensation Costs \nWe allocate shared costs, such as facilities costs (including rent, utilities and depreciation on assets shared by all departments), certain information technology costs and recruiting costs to all departments based on headcount. As such, allocated shared costs are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Employee compensation costs include salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation for each cost of revenue and operating expense category, sales commissions for sales and marketing and any compensation related taxes. \nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin \nCost of Subscription\n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cost of subscription primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our services and providing support. These expenses include employee-related costs associated with our cloud-based infrastructure and our customer support organization, third-party hosting fees, software and maintenance costs, outside services associated with the delivery of our subscription services, amortization expense associated with capitalized internal-use software and acquired developed technology and allocated overhead. \nWe intend to continue to invest additional resources in our platform infrastructure and our platform support organizations. As we continue to invest in technology innovation, we anticipate that capitalized internal-use software \n56\ncosts and related amortization may increase. We expect our investment in technology to expand the capability of our platform enabling us to improve our gross margin over time. The level and timing of investment in these areas could affect our cost of subscription revenue in the future. \nCost of Professional Services and Other\n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cost of professional services consists primarily of employee-related costs for our professional services delivery team, travel-related costs, allocated overhead and costs of outside services associated with supplementing our professional services delivery team. The cost of providing professional services has historically been higher than the associated revenue we generate. \nGross Margin\n.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue. Our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period as a result of the timing and amount of investments to expand our hosting capacity, our continued efforts to build platform support and professional services teams, increased stock-based compensation expenses, as well as the amortization of costs associated with capitalized internal-use software and acquired intangible assets.   \nOperating Expenses \nResearch and Development.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Research and development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation costs and allocated overhead. We believe that continued investment in our platform is important for our growth. We expect our research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as our business grows. \nSales and Marketing.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee compensation costs, costs of general marketing and promotional activities, travel-related expenses, amortization expense associated with acquired customer relationships (including unbilled and unrecognized contracts yet to be fulfilled) and trade names and allocated overhead. Commissions earned by our sales force that are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we have determined to be\u00a0generally five\u00a0years. We expect our sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest operating expense category for the foreseeable future as we expand our sales and marketing efforts and as we return to in-person sales formats and experiences for future annual user conferences. In the short-term, our sales and marketing expenses may increase as a percentage of our total revenue, however, over time, we expect this percentage to decrease as our total revenue grows. \nGeneral and Administrative.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee compensation costs for finance, accounting, legal, information technology and human resources personnel. In addition, general and administrative expenses include acquisition and integration-related costs, non-personnel costs, such as legal, accounting and other professional fees, charitable contributions, and all other supporting corporate expenses, such as information technology, not allocated to other departments. We expect our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as our business grows. \nInterest and Other, Net \nInterest and other, net consists of interest expense, which primarily includes amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and contractual interest expense for our 2023 Notes, convertible notes due in 2025 (\"2025 Notes\") and convertible notes due in 2026 (\"2026 Notes\", together with the 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes, the \"Notes\"), interest income from our investment holdings, gains and losses from our strategic investments and loss on early extinguishment and conversion of debt. \nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes \nOur provision for (benefit from) income taxes consists of federal and state income taxes in the United States and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions where we operate. The primary difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate relates to the net operating losses in jurisdictions with a valuation allowance against related deferred tax assets.\n57\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented in dollars:\n\u00a0\nYear\u00a0Ended\u00a0January\u00a031,\n\u00a0\n2022\n2021\n2020\n\u00a0\n(in thousands)\nRevenue\nSubscription\n$\n1,249,210\u00a0\n$\n796,613\u00a0\n$\n552,688\u00a0\nProfessional services and other\n50,991\u00a0\n38,811\u00a0\n33,379\u00a0\nTotal revenue\n1,300,201\u00a0\n835,424\u00a0\n586,067\u00a0\nCost of revenue\nSubscription\n(1)\n329,131\u00a0\n170,095\u00a0\n116,445\u00a0\nProfessional services and other\n(1)\n67,274\u00a0\n47,586\u00a0\n42,937\u00a0\nTotal cost of revenue\n396,405\u00a0\n217,681\u00a0\n159,382\u00a0\nGross profit\n903,796\u00a0\n617,743\u00a0\n426,685\u00a0\nOperating expenses\nResearch and development\n(1)\n469,259\u00a0\n222,826\u00a0\n159,269\u00a0\nSales and marketing\n(1)\n770,326\u00a0\n427,350\u00a0\n340,356\u00a0\nGeneral and administrative\n(1)\n431,314\u00a0\n171,726\u00a0\n112,892\u00a0\nTotal operating expenses\n1,670,899\u00a0\n821,902\u00a0\n612,517\u00a0\nOperating loss\n(767,103)\n(204,159)\n(185,832)\nInterest expense\n(92,182)\n(72,660)\n(27,017)\nInterest income and other, net\n9,768\u00a0\n12,891\u00a0\n17,089\u00a0\nLoss on early extinguishment and conversion of debt\n(179)\n(2,263)\n(14,572)\nInterest and other, net\n(82,593)\n(62,032)\n(24,500)\nLoss before provision for (benefit from) income taxes\n(849,696)\n(266,191)\n(210,332)\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\n(1,285)\n141\u00a0\n(1,419)\nNet loss\n$\n(848,411)\n$\n(266,332)\n$\n(208,913)\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIncludes stock-based compensation expense as follows:\n\u00a0\nYear Ended January 31,\n\u00a0\n2022\n2021\n2020\n\u00a0\n(in thousands)\nCost of subscription revenue\n$\n49,091\u00a0\n$\n21,895\u00a0\n$\n12,923\u00a0\nCost of professional services and other revenue\n12,324\u00a0\n8,083\u00a0\n7,164\u00a0\nResearch and development\n192,712\u00a0\n63,270\u00a0\n37,683\u00a0\nSales and marketing\n135,916\u00a0\n53,802\u00a0\n38,077\u00a0\nGeneral and administrative\n175,437\u00a0\n49,131\u00a0\n30,777\u00a0\nTotal stock-based compensation expense\n$\n565,480\u00a0\n$\n196,181\u00a0\n$\n126,624\u00a0\n58\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented as a percentage of our total revenue:\n\u00a0\nYear Ended January 31,\n\u00a0\n2022\n2021\n2020\nRevenue\n\u00a0\nSubscription\n96\u00a0\n%\n95\u00a0\n%\n94\u00a0\n%\nProfessional services and other\n4\u00a0\n5\u00a0\n6\u00a0\nTotal revenue\n100\u00a0\n100\u00a0\n100\u00a0\nCost of revenue\nSubscription\n25\u00a0\n20\u00a0\n20\u00a0\nProfessional services and other\n5\u00a0\n6\u00a0\n7\u00a0\nTotal cost of revenue\n30\u00a0\n26\u00a0\n27\u00a0\nGross profit\n70\u00a0\n74\u00a0\n73\u00a0\nOperating expenses\nResearch and development\n36\u00a0\n27\u00a0\n27\u00a0\nSales and marketing\n59\u00a0\n51\u00a0\n58\u00a0\nGeneral and administrative\n34\u00a0\n20\u00a0\n20\u00a0\nTotal operating expenses\n129\u00a0\n98\u00a0\n105\u00a0\nOperating loss\n(59)\n(24)\n(32)\nInterest expense\n(7)\n(9)\n(5)\nInterest income and other, net\n1\u00a0\n1\u00a0\n3\u00a0\nLoss on early extinguishment and conversion of debt\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n(2)\nInterest and other, net\n(6)\n(8)\n(4)\nLoss before provision for (benefit from) income taxes\n(65)\n(32)\n(36)\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\nNet loss\n(65)\n%\n(32)\n%\n(36)\n%\n59\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended January\u00a031, 2022 compared to the year ended January\u00a031, 2021 is presented below.

The increase was primarily due to the addition of new customers, an increase in users and sales of additional products to existing customers, and the inclusion of Auth0 revenue from the acquisition date of May\u00a03, 2021,\nProfessional services and other revenue increased by $12.2 million, or 31%, for the year ended January 31, 2022 compared to the year ended January 31, 2021. The increase in professional services revenue was primarily related to an increase in implementation and other services associated with growth in the number of new customers purchasing our subscription services, as well as the inclusion of Auth0 revenue from the acquisition date.\nThe business combination with Auth0 contributed approximately $139.7 million in total revenue for the period from the acquisition date. \nCost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\n\u00a0\nYear Ended January 31,\n\u00a0\n2022\n2021\n$ Change\n%\u00a0Change\n \n\u00a0\n(dollars in thousands)\nCost of revenue:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSubscription\n$\n329,131\u00a0\n$\n170,095\u00a0\n$\n159,036\u00a0\n93\u00a0\n%\nProfessional services and other\n67,274\u00a0\n47,586\u00a0\n19,688\u00a0\n41\u00a0\nTotal cost of revenue\n$\n396,405\u00a0\n$\n217,681\u00a0\n$\n178,724\u00a0\n82\u00a0\n%\nGross profit\n$\n903,796\u00a0\n$\n617,743\u00a0\n$\n286,053\u00a0\n46\u00a0\n%\nGross margin:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSubscription\n74\u00a0\n%\n79\u00a0\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nProfessional services and other\n(32)\n(23)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTotal gross margin\n70\u00a0\n%\n74\u00a0\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCost of subscription revenue increased by $159.0 million, or 93%, for the year ended January 31, 2022 compared to the year ended January 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase of $77.5 million in employee compensation costs related to higher headcount to support the growth in our subscription services, including the Auth0 acquisition, an increase in amortization of acquired developed technology of $28.0 million primarily in connection with the Auth0 acquisition, an increase of $26.6 million in third-party hosting costs as we expanded capacity to support our growth and an increase of $11.8 million in software license costs.\n60\nOur gross margin for subscription revenue decreased to 74% from 79% during the year ended January 31, 2022, compared to the year ended January 31, 2021 primarily due to the inclusion of Auth0 revenue, which carries a higher relative cost and lower gross margin as well as an increase in amortization of acquired developed technology primarily in connection with the Auth0 acquisition. While our gross margins for subscription revenue may fluctuate in the near-term as we invest in our growth, we expect our subscription revenue gross margin to improve over the long-term as we achieve additional economies of scale. \nCost of professional services and other revenue increased by $19.7 million, or 41%, for the year ended January 31, 2022, compared to the year ended January 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase of $15.5 million in employee compensation costs related to higher headcount, including the Auth0 acquisition. \nOur gross margin for professional services and other revenue decreased to (32)% during the year ended January 31, 2022 from (23)% during the year ended January 31, 2021 and includes Auth0.\nOperating Expenses \nResearch and Development Expenses\n\u00a0\nYear Ended January 31,\n\u00a0\n2022\n2021\n$ Change\n%\u00a0Change\n \u00a0\n\u00a0\n(dollars in thousands)\nResearch and development\n$\n469,259\u00a0\n$\n222,826\u00a0\n$\n246,433\u00a0\n111\u00a0\n%\nPercentage of revenue\n36\u00a0\n%\n27\u00a0\n%\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nResearch and development expenses increased $246.4 million, or 111%, for the year ended January 31, 2022 compared to the year ended January 31, 2021.

The increase in employee compensation costs includes $33.8 million in one-time stock-based compensation expense related to accelerated vesting of equity awards for certain Auth0 employees at transaction close and $36.5 million in stock-based compensation expense related to the revesting agreements from our Auth0 acquisition in the year ended January 31, 2022.\nInterest and Other, Net\n\u00a0\nYear Ended January 31,\n\u00a0\n2022\n2021\n$ Change\n%\u00a0Change\n \u00a0\n\u00a0\n(dollars in thousands)\nInterest expense\n$\n(92,182)\n$\n(72,660)\n$\n(19,522)\n27\u00a0\n%\nInterest income and other, net\n9,768\u00a0\n12,891\u00a0\n(3,123)\n(24)\nLoss on early extinguishment and conversion of debt\n(179)\n(2,263)\n2,084\u00a0\n(92)\nInterest and other, net\n$\n(82,593)\n$\n(62,032)\nInterest expense increased $19.5 million, or 27%, for the year ended January 31, 2022 compared to the year ended January 31, 2021, due primarily to an increase of $20.5 million for the 2026 Notes that were issued in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, partially offset by a decrease of $2.6 million for the 2023 Notes, due to the partial repurchase of the 2023 Notes in June 2020 (\"Second Partial Repurchase of 2023 Notes\") and other conversion activity. \nInterest income and other, net decreased $3.1 million, or (24)%, for the year ended January 31, 2022 compared to the year ended January 31, 2021, primarily due to a decrease of $8.4 million in interest income resulting from lower interest rates and an increase of $2.9 million in foreign currency exchange losses, partially offset by an $8.2 million change in net realized gains and unrealized adjustments in the carrying value of our strategic investments.\nLoss on early extinguishment and conversion of debt decreased $2.1 million, or (92)%, for the year ended January 31, 2022 compared to the year ended January 31, 2021 due to the Second Partial Repurchase of 2023 Notes which occurred in the year ended January 31, 2021 but not in the year ended January 31, 2022.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures \nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we believe the following\u00a0non-GAAP\u00a0measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance\n. \nWe use the below referenced non-GAAP financial information, collectively, to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively with GAAP financial measures, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance, and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses \n62\nthat are required by GAAP to be recorded in our financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by our management about which expenses are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit and Non-GAAP Gross Margin \nWe define Non-GAAP gross profit and Non-GAAP gross margin as GAAP gross profit and GAAP gross margin, adjusted for stock-based compensation expense included in cost of revenue, amortization of acquired intangibles and acquisition and integration-related expenses.\nYear Ended January 31,\n2022\n2021\n2020\n(dollars in thousands)\nGross profit\n$\n903,796\u00a0\n$\n617,743\u00a0\n$\n426,685\u00a0\nAdd:\nStock-based compensation expense included in cost of revenue\n61,415\u00a0\n29,978\u00a0\n20,087\u00a0\nAmortization of acquired intangibles\n34,391\u00a0\n6,373\u00a0\n5,488\u00a0\nAcquisition and integration-related expenses\n(1)\n1,889\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\nNon-GAAP gross profit\n$\n1,001,491\u00a0\n$\n654,094\u00a0\n$\n452,260\u00a0\nGross margin\n70\u00a0\n%\n74\u00a0\n%\n73\u00a0\n%\nNon-GAAP gross margin\n77\u00a0\n%\n78\u00a0\n%\n77\u00a0\n%\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAcquisition and integration-related expenses include transaction costs and other non-recurring incremental costs incurred through the one-year anniversary of transaction close.\nNon-GAAP Operating Income (Loss) and Non-GAAP Operating Margin \nWe define Non-GAAP operating income (loss) and Non-GAAP operating margin as GAAP operating loss and GAAP operating margin, adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, non-cash charitable contributions, amortization of acquired intangibles and acquisition and integration-related expenses.\nYear Ended January 31,\n2022\n2021\n2020\n(dollars in thousands)\nOperating loss\n$\n(767,103)\n$\n(204,159)\n$\n(185,832)\nAdd:\nStock-based compensation expense\n565,480\u00a0\n196,181\u00a0\n126,624\u00a0\nNon-cash charitable contributions\n7,238\u00a0\n9,292\u00a0\n1,746\u00a0\nAmortization of acquired intangibles\n64,000\u00a0\n6,373\u00a0\n5,488\u00a0\nAcquisition and integration-related expenses\n(1)\n56,667\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n3,449\u00a0\nNon-GAAP operating income (loss)\n$\n(73,718)\n$\n7,687\u00a0\n$\n(48,525)\nOperating margin\n(59)\n%\n(24)\n%\n(32)\n%\nNon-GAAP operating margin\n(6)\n%\n1\u00a0\n%\n(8)\n%\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAcquisition and integration-related expenses include transaction costs and other non-recurring incremental costs incurred through the one-year anniversary of transaction close.\nNon-GAAP Net Income (Loss), Non-GAAP Net Margin and Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) Per Share, Basic and Diluted\nWe define Non-GAAP net income (loss) and Non-GAAP net margin as GAAP net loss and GAAP net margin, adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, non-cash charitable contributions, amortization of acquired intangibles, acquisition and integration-related expenses, amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs and loss on early extinguishment and conversion of debt.\n63\nWe define Non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic, as Non-GAAP net income (loss) divided by GAAP weighted-average shares used to compute net loss per share, basic and diluted.\nWe define Non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, diluted, as Non-GAAP net income (loss) divided by GAAP weighted-average shares used to compute net loss per share, basic and diluted adjusted for the potentially dilutive effect of (i) employee equity incentive plans, excluding the impact of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, and (ii) convertible senior notes outstanding and related warrants.

Our cash equivalents and investments consisted primarily of U.S. treasury securities, corporate debt securities and money market funds. Historically, we have generated significant operating losses and both positive and negative cash flows from operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit and consolidated statements of cash flows. We expect to continue to incur operating losses and cash flows from operations that may fluctuate between positive and negative amounts for the foreseeable future. \nIn February 2018, we completed our private offering of the 2023 Notes due on February\u00a015, 2023 and received aggregate proceeds of\u00a0$345.0 million, before deducting costs of issuance of\u00a0$10.0 million. The interest rate on the 2023 Notes is fixed at 0.25%\u00a0per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2018. In connection with the issuance of the 2023 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedges (\"Note Hedges\") with respect to our Class\u00a0A common stock. We used an aggregate amount of\u00a0$80.0 million\u00a0of the net proceeds from the sale of the 2023 Notes to purchase the Note Hedges. The cost of the Note Hedges was partially offset by proceeds of\u00a0$52.4 million\u00a0from the sale of warrants to purchase shares of our Class A common stock (\"Warrants\") in connection with the issuance of the 2023 Notes.\n65\nIn September 2019, we completed our private offering of the 2025 Notes due on September\u00a01, 2025 and received aggregate proceeds of $1,060.0 million, before deducting issuance costs of approximately $19.3 million. The interest rate on the 2025 Notes is fixed at 0.125% per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on March 1, 2020. In connection with the 2025 Notes, we entered into capped call transactions (\"2025 Capped Calls\") with respect to our Class A common stock. We used an aggregate amount of $74.1 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the 2025 Notes to purchase the 2025 Capped Calls.\nConcurrent with the private offering of the 2025 Notes, we repurchased $224.4 million principal amount of the 2023 Notes in privately-negotiated transactions for aggregate consideration of $604.8 million, including approximately $224.4 million in cash and approximately 3.0 million shares of Class A common stock. We also terminated a portion of our existing Note Hedges and Warrants in amounts corresponding to the principal amount of the partial repurchase of the 2023 Notes in September 2019 (\"First Partial Repurchase of 2023 Notes\", and together with the Second Partial Repurchase of 2023 Notes, the \"2023 Notes Partial Repurchases\") for net proceeds of $47.2 million.\nIn June 2020, we completed our private offering of the 2026 Notes due on June\u00a015, 2026 and received aggregate proceeds of $1,150.0 million, before deducting issuance costs of approximately $15.2 million. The interest rate on the 2026 Notes is fixed at 0.375% per year and is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2020. In connection with the 2026 Notes, we entered into capped call transactions (\"2026 Capped Calls\") with respect to our Class A common stock. We used an aggregate amount of $134.0 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the 2026 Notes to purchase the 2026 Capped Calls.\nConcurrent with the private offering of the 2026 Notes, we repurchased $69.9 million principal amount of the 2023 Notes in privately-negotiated transactions for aggregate consideration of $260.5 million, including approximately 1.4\u00a0million shares of Class A common stock and $0.2 million in cash. We also terminated a portion of our existing Note Hedges and Warrants in amounts corresponding to the principal amount of the Second Partial Repurchase of 2023 Notes for net proceeds of $19.6 million.\nThrough January\u00a031, 2022, we converted and settled approximately $33.4 million principal amount of 2023 Notes (not in connection with the 2023 Notes Partial Repurchases) and exercised and net-share-settled Note Hedges corresponding to approximately $33.4 million principal amount of 2023 Notes. In connection with these transactions, we issued approximately 0.7 million shares of Class A common stock and received approximately 0.5 million shares of Class A common stock, accompanied by immaterial cash payments. Subsequent to January\u00a031, 2022, the Company received conversion requests for approximately $2.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes.\nOn May 3, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Auth0. In connection with this acquisition, consideration included cash of $149.6 million, net of cash acquired of $107.4 million, and approximately 19.2 million shares of our common stock with an estimated fair value of $5,175.6 million. In addition, we assumed outstanding employee equity awards with vested fair value of $238.4 million. Our consolidated results of operations include the results of operations for Auth0 for the period from May 3, 2021 through January\u00a031, 2022.\nOn August 2, 2021, we completed the acquisition of atSpoke, providing total cash consideration, net of cash acquired of $79.0 million. Of this amount, $13.4 million of consideration was held back as partial security for any adjustments and indemnification obligations and will be paid within 18 months of the closing date. \nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, our investments and cash provided by sales of our products and services will be sufficient to meet our short-term and long-term projected working capital and capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our subscription growth rate, subscription renewal activity, billing frequency, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the expansion of our international operations, the introduction of new and enhanced product offerings, the continuing market adoption of our platform, and the costs associated with integration of acquired businesses. We continue to assess our capital structure and evaluate the merits of deploying available cash. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in new technologies this could reduce our ability to compete successfully and harm our results of operations.\n66\nA significant majority of our customers pay in advance for annual subscriptions. Therefore, a substantial source of our cash is from our deferred revenue, which is included on our consolidated balance sheet as a liability. Deferred revenue consists of the unearned portion of billed fees for our subscriptions, which is recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. As of January\u00a031, 2022, we had deferred revenue of $996.2 million, of which $973.3 million was recorded as a current liability and is expected to be recorded as revenue in the next 12 months, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nCash Flows \nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated: \n\u00a0\nYear Ended January 31,\n\u00a0\n2022\n2021\n2020\n\u00a0\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n104,119\u00a0\n$\n127,962\u00a0\n$\n55,603\u00a0\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(366,812)\n(1,305,146)\n(688,041)\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n89,066\u00a0\n1,091,598\u00a0\n853,385\u00a0\nEffects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n(2,347)\n2,263\u00a0\n(209)\nNet (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n(175,974)\n$\n(83,323)\n$\n220,738\u00a0\nOperating Activities \nOur largest source of operating cash is cash collections from our customers for subscription and professional services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee-related expenditures, marketing expenses and third-party hosting costs. In recent periods, we have supplemented working capital requirements through net proceeds from the issuance of the 2023, 2025 and 2026 Notes in February 2018, September 2019 and June 2020, respectively.\nDuring the year ended January 31, 2022, cash provided by operating activities was $104.1 million primarily due to our net loss of $848.4 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $811.4 million and net cash inflows of $141.1 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation, depreciation, amortization and accretion of property and equipment, intangible assets and short-term investments, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and amortization of deferred commissions. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities related to a $416.4 million increase in deferred revenue, a $78.5 million increase in accrued compensation, accrued other expenses and accounts payable, and a $22.9 million decrease in operating lease right-of-use assets, partially offset by a $174.8 million increase in accounts receivable, a $170.6 million increase in deferred commissions, a $24.5 million decrease in operating lease liabilities and a $6.8 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets.\nDuring the year ended January 31, 2021, cash provided by operating activities was $128.0 million primarily due to our net loss of $266.3 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $357.0 million and net cash inflows of $37.3 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, amortization of deferred commissions,  depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets, non-cash charitable contributions, loss on early extinguishment and conversion of debt and deferred income taxes. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities related to a $142.1 million increase in deferred revenue, a $53.8 million increase in accounts payable, accrued compensation and accrued other expenses and a $19.1 million decrease in operating lease right-of-use assets, partially offset by a $81.0 million increase in deferred commissions, a $66.4 million increase in accounts receivable, a $17.2 million decrease in operating lease liabilities and a $13.2 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets.\nInvesting Activities \nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended January 31, 2022 of $366.8 million was primarily attributable to purchases of investments of $1,846.7 million, payments of $215.2 million, net of cash acquired, in connection with our Auth0 and atSpoke acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment of $12.3 million to support additional office space and headcount and the capitalization of internal-use software costs of $4.3 million \n67\nassociated with the development of additional features and functionality for our platform. These activities were partially offset by proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments of $1,711.8 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended January 31, 2021 of $1,305.1 million was primarily attributable to the purchases of investments of $2,029.0 million, purchases of property and equipment of $13.1 million to support additional office space and headcount and the capitalization of internal-use software costs of $4.2 million associated with the development of additional features and functionality for our platform. These activities were offset by proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments of $741.3 million.\nFinancing Activities \nCash provided by financing activities during the\u00a0year ended January 31, 2022\u00a0of\u00a0$89.1 million\u00a0was primarily attributable to proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $53.5 million, and proceeds from employee purchases under our employee stock purchase plan (\"ESPP\") of $35.6 million.\nCash provided by financing activities during the\u00a0year ended January 31, 2021\u00a0of\u00a0$1,091.6 million\u00a0was primarily attributable to the issuance of the 2026 Notes for proceeds of\u00a0$1,134.8 million, net of issuance costs and proceeds from the termination of Note Hedges of $195.0 million, offset by payments for termination of Warrants of $175.4 million and the purchase of the 2026 Capped Calls of $134.0 million. Other items impacting cash provided by financing activities include proceeds from the exercise of stock options of\u00a0$45.6 million\u00a0and proceeds from our ESPP of\u00a0$25.9 million.\nObligations and Other Commitments \nOur principal commitments consist of obligations under our convertible senior notes, operating leases for office space, data center hosting facilities, and other sales and marketing obligations. Our obligations under our convertible senior notes are described in the \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" section of Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Information regarding our non-cancellable lease and other purchase commitments as of January\u00a031, 2022 can be found in Notes 10 and 11 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIndemnification Agreements \nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements of varying scope and terms pursuant to which we agree to indemnify customers, vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the breach of such agreements, services to be provided by us or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain officers and employees that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers or employees. No demands have been made upon us to provide indemnification under such agreements and there are no claims that we are aware of that could have a material effect on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, or consolidated statements of cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations would be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss below. \nRevenue Recognition \nWe derive revenue from subscription fees (which include support fees) and professional services fees. We sell subscriptions to our platform through arrangements that are generally one to five years in length. Our arrangements are generally non-cancellable and non-refundable. Furthermore, if a customer reduces the contracted \n68\nusage or service level, the customer has no right of refund. Our subscription arrangements do not provide customers with the right to take possession of the software supporting the platform and, as a result, are accounted for as service arrangements. This revenue recognition policy is consistent for sales generated directly with customers and sales generated indirectly through channel partners. \nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps: \n\u2022\nIdentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u2022\nIdentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u2022\nDetermination of the transaction price;\n\u2022\nAllocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u2022\nRecognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nSubscription Revenue \nSubscription revenue, which includes support, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable contractual term of the arrangement, generally beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer.\nProfessional Services Revenue \nOur professional services principally consist of customer-specific requests for application integrations, user interface enhancements and other customer specific requests. Revenue for our professional services is recognized as services are performed in proportion with their pattern of transfer. \nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nSome of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative stand-alone selling price (\"SSP\") basis.\u00a0We determine SSP based on observable prices, if available, for those related services when sold separately. When such observable prices are not available, we determine SSP based on overarching pricing objectives and strategies, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including customer size, volume purchased, market and industry conditions, product-specific factors and historical sales of the deliverables.\nBusiness Combinations\nWhen we acquire a business, the purchase price is allocated to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to intangible assets. These estimates can include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nfuture expected cash flows from subscription contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies;\n\u2022\nperson hours required in recreating certain acquired technologies;\n\u2022\nhistorical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;\n\u2022\nroyalty rates applied to acquired developed technology platforms and other intangible assets;\n\u2022\nobsolescence curves and other useful life assumptions, such as the period of time and intended use of acquired intangible assets in our product offerings;\n\u2022\ndiscount rates; \n\u2022\nuncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances; and\n69\n\u2022\nfair value of assumed equity awards.\nThese estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. We continue to collect information and reevaluate these estimates and assumptions quarterly and record any adjustments to our preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations.\nGoodwill on our consolidated balance sheets totaled $5,401.3 million and $48.0 million as of January\u00a031, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually on November 1 or more frequently if certain indicators are present. Based on the annual assessment, no indicator of impairment was noted and as such no impairment charge was recorded during the years ended January 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nWe account for the issuance of convertible senior notes in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Subtopic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (\"ASC 470-20\"). Pursuant to ASC 470-20, as our Notes have a net settlement feature and may be settled wholly or partially in cash upon conversion, we are required to separately account for the liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument. The carrying amount of the liability component is computed by estimating the fair value of a similar liability without the conversion option using income and market based approaches. For the income-based approach, we use a convertible bond pricing model that includes several assumptions such as volatility, the risk-free rate, and observable trading activity for our existing Notes. For the market-based approach, we observe the price of derivative instruments purchased in conjunction with our convertible senior note issuances or we evaluate issuances of convertible debt securities by other companies with similar credit risk ratings at the time of issuance. The amount of the equity component is then calculated by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the principal amount of the instrument. This difference represents a debt discount that is amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the Notes using an effective interest rate method. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the issuance costs related to the Notes, the allocation of issuance costs incurred between the liability and equity components were based on their relative values.\nSimilarly, in accordance with ASC 470-20, transactions involving contemporaneous exchanges of cash between the same debtor and creditor in connection with the issuance of a new debt obligation and satisfaction of an existing debt obligation by the debtor should be evaluated as a modification or an exchange transaction depending on whether the exchange is determined to have substantially different terms. When the exchange is deemed to have substantially different terms due to a significant difference between the value of the conversion option immediately prior to and after the exchange, the transaction is accounted for as a debt extinguishment. Pursuant to ASC 470-20, total consideration for the satisfaction of an existing debt obligation is separated into liability and equity components by estimating the fair value of a similar liability without a conversion option and assigning the residual value to the equity component. The effective interest rate used to estimate the fair value of the liability component is based on the income and market based approaches used to determine the effective interest rate of the new debt obligation, adjusted for the remaining tenor of the extinguished debt. The difference between the fair value and the amortized carrying value of the extinguished debt, net of the proportionate amounts of unamortized debt discount and remaining unamortized debt issuance costs, is recorded as a gain or loss on extinguishment.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies \u2014 Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\" and \" \u2014 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\u201d for more information.\n70", "item7a": ">Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk \nForeign Currency Exchange Risk \nThe functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are the respective local currencies. Most of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore our revenue is not currently subject to significant foreign currency risk. Our operating expenses are denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located, which are primarily in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. Our consolidated results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk or other derivative financial instruments. During the years ended January 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. \nInterest Rate Risk \nWe had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $2,501.8 million as of January\u00a031, 2022, of which $2,393.9 million was invested in U.S. treasury securities, corporate debt securities and money market funds. Our cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital and general corporate purposes, including potential future acquisition activity. Our short-term investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.\nOur cash equivalents and our investment portfolio are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of our expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classify our short-term investments as \u201cavailable for sale,\u201d no gains are recognized due to changes in interest rates. As losses due to changes in interest rates are generally not considered to be credit related changes, no losses in such securities are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless we intend to sell, it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell, we sell prior to maturity, or we otherwise determine that all or a portion of the decline in fair value are due to credit related factors. \nAs of January\u00a031, 2022, a hypothetical 10% relative change in interest rates would not have had a material impact on the value of our cash equivalents or investment portfolio. Fluctuations in the value of our cash equivalents and investment portfolio caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities prior to maturity. \nConvertible Senior Notes\nIn February 2018, we issued\u00a0the 2023 Notes due February\u00a015, 2023 with a principal amount of\u00a0$345.0 million, of which $224.4 million and $69.9 million were repurchased in September 2019 and June 2020, respectively. Concurrently with the issuance of the 2023 Notes, we entered into separate Note Hedges and Warrant transactions, a portion of which were terminated in September 2019 and June 2020 in connection with the 2023 Notes Partial Repurchases. The Note Hedges were completed to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the 2023 Notes. Additionally, through January\u00a031, 2022, we received and completed requests to convert approximately $33.4 million principal amount of 2023 Notes (not in connection with the 2023 Notes Partial Repurchases) and exercised and net-share-settled Note Hedges corresponding to approximately $33.4 million principal amount of 2023 Notes. Subsequent to January\u00a031, 2022, the Company received conversion requests for approximately $2.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes.\nIn September 2019, we issued the 2025 Notes due September\u00a01, 2025 with a principal amount of $1,060.0 million. Concurrently with the issuance of the 2025 Notes, we entered into separate capped call transactions. The 2025 Capped Calls were completed to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the 2025 Notes.\nIn June 2020, we issued the 2026 Notes due June\u00a015, 2026 with a principal amount of $1,150.0 million. Concurrently with the issuance of the 2026 Notes, we entered into separate capped call transactions. The 2026 Capped Calls were completed to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the 2026 Notes.\nThe 2023 Notes, 2025 Notes and 2026 Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 0.25%, 0.125% and 0.375%, respectively; accordingly, we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the Notes. However, the fair value of the Notes is exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of the fixed interest rate of the \n71\nNotes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of the Notes fluctuates when the market price of our common stock fluctuates. The fair value was determined based on the quoted bid price of the Notes in an over-the-counter market on the last trading day of the reporting period.
