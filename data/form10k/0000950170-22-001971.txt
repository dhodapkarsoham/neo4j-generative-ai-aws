Variable rate loans bear interest at a rate that may be determined by the larger of the floor or the reference to either LIBOR (\"L\"), SOFR (\"S\") or alternate base rate (commonly based on the U.S. Prime Rate (\"P\"), unless otherwise noted) at the borrower\u2019s option, which reset periodically based on the terms of the credit agreement. L and S loans are typically indexed to 12 month, 6 month, 3 month, 2 month, 1 month or 1 week L or S rates. As of December 31, 2021, rates for the 12 month, 6 month, 3 month, 2 month, 1 month and 1 week L are 0.58%, 0.34%, 0.21%, 0.15%, 0.10% and 0.08%, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, 3 month S was 0.05%, P was 3.25%, and Canadian Prime rate (\"CDN P\") was 2.45%.

See Note 3 \u201cSignificant Agreements and Related Party Transactions\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n^^\n\n\nAs defined in the Investment Company Act, the investment is deemed to be a \u201ccontrolled affiliated person\u201d of the Company because the Company owns, either directly or indirectly, 25% or more of the portfolio company\u2019s outstanding voting securities or has the power to exercise control over management or policies of such portfolio company. See Note 3 \u201cSignificant Agreements and Related Party Transactions\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n^^^\n\n\nThe investment is otherwise deemed to be an \u201caffiliated person\u201d of the Company.

The Company may not acquire any non-qualifying asset unless, at the time of acquisition, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the Company\u2019s total assets. As of December 31, 2021 the aggregate fair value of these securities is $154,694 or 4.36% of the Company\u2019s total assets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\nRepresent co-investments made with the Company\u2019s affiliates in accordance with the terms of the exemptive relief received from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. See Note 3 \u201cSignificant Agreements and Related Party Transactions\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3)\n\n\nThe fair value of the investment was determined using significant unobservable inputs. See Note 5 \u201cFair Value Measurement\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(4)\n\n\nPosition or portion thereof is an unfunded loan commitment, and no interest is being earned on the unfunded portion. The unfunded loan commitment may be subject to a commitment termination date that may expire prior to the maturity date stated. The negative cost, if applicable, is the result of the capitalized discount being greater than the principal amount outstanding on the loan. The negative fair value, if applicable, is the result of the capitalized discount on the loan. See Note 8 \"Commitments and Contingencies\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(5)\n\n\nThe investment is on non-accrual status.

Variable rate loans bear interest at a rate that may be determined by the larger of the floor or the reference to either LIBOR (\"L\") or alternate base rate (commonly based on the Prime Rate (\"P\")), at the borrower\u2019s option, which reset periodically based on the terms of the credit agreement. L loans are typically indexed to 12 month, 6 month, 3 month, 2 month, 1 month or 1 week L rates. As of December 31, 2020, rates for the 12 month, 6 month, 3 month, 2 month, 1 month and 1 week L are 0.34%, 0.26%, 0.24%, 0.19%, 0.14% and 0.10%. As of December 31, 2020, P was 3.25%.

The Company may not acquire any non-qualifying asset unless, at the time of acquisition, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the Company\u2019s total assets. As of December 31, 2020 the aggregate fair value of these securities is $96,067 or 2.90% of the Company\u2019s total assets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2)\n\n\nRepresent co-investments made with the Company\u2019s affiliates in accordance with the terms of the exemptive relief received from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The unfunded loan commitment may be subject to a commitment termination date that may expire prior to the maturity date stated. The negative cost, if applicable, is the result of the capitalized discount being greater than the principal amount outstanding on the loan. The negative fair value, if applicable, is the result of the capitalized discount on the loan. See Note 8 \"Commitments and Contingencies\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(4)\n\n\nThe fair value of the investment was determined using significant unobservable inputs.

(the \u201cCompany,\u201d which term refers to either Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. or Goldman Sachs BDC, Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context may require) was initially established as Goldman Sachs Liberty Harbor Capital, LLC, a single member Delaware limited liability company (\u201cSMLLC\u201d), on September 26, 2012 and commenced operations on November 15, 2012 with The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (\u201cGroup Inc.\u201d) as its sole member. On March 29, 2013, the Company elected to be regulated as a business development company (\u201cBDC\u201d) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d). Effective April 1, 2013, the Company converted from a SMLLC to a Delaware corporation. In addition, the Company has elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (\u201cRIC\u201d) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2013.\n \n\n\nThe Company\u2019s investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation primarily through direct originations of secured debt, including first lien debt, unitranche loans, including last-out portions of such loans, and second lien debt, and unsecured debt, including mezzanine debt, as well as through select equity investments.\n \n\n\nGoldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. (\u201cGSAM\u201d), a Delaware limited partnership and an affiliate of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (including its predecessors, \u201cGS & Co.\u201d), is the investment adviser (the \u201cInvestment Adviser\u201d) of the Company. The term \u201cGoldman Sachs\u201d refers to Group Inc., together with GS & Co., GSAM and its other subsidiaries.\n \n\n\nOn March 23, 2015, the Company completed its initial public offering and the Company\u2019s common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \u201cGSBD.\u201d\n \n\n\nThe Company has formed wholly owned subsidiaries, which are structured as Delaware limited liability companies, to hold certain equity or equity-like investments in portfolio companies.\n \n\n\nThe Merger with Goldman Sachs Middle Market Lending Corp.\n\n\nOn October 12, 2020, the Company completed its merger (the \u201cMerger\u201d) with Goldman Sachs Middle Market Lending Corp. (\u201cGS MMLC\u201d) pursuant to the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d), dated as of June 11, 2020.  In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of GS MMLC common stock was converted into the right to receive, for each share of GS MMLC common stock, that number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (\u201cCommon Stock\u201d), with a net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d) equal to the NAV per share of GS MMLC common stock, in each case calculated as of October 9, 2020.  As a result of the Merger, the Company issued an aggregate of 61,037,311 shares of Common Stock to former GS MMLC stockholders. For further information, see Note 13 \u201cMerger with GS MMLC.\u201d\n \n\n\n2.\tSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n \n\n\nBasis of Presentation\n \n\n\nThe Company\u2019s functional currency is U.S. dollars (\u201cUSD\u201d) and these consolidated financial statements have been prepared in that currency. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and pursuant to Regulation S-X. This requires the Company to make certain estimates and assumptions that may affect the amounts reported on the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These consolidated financial statements reflect normal and recurring adjustments that in the opinion of the Company are necessary for the fair statement of the results for the periods presented. Actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions included on the consolidated financial statements.\n \n\n\nCertain prior period information has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The reclassification has no effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial position or the consolidated results of operations as previously reported.\n\n\nAs an investment company, the Company applies the accounting and reporting guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 946,\n Financial Services \u2013 Investment Companies\n (\u201cASC 946\u201d) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d)\n.\n \n\n\nBasis of Consolidation\n \n\n\nAs provided under ASC 946, the Company will not consolidate its investment in a company other than an investment company subsidiary or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to the Company. Accordingly, the Company consolidated the financial position and results of operations of its wholly owned subsidiaries, BDC Blocker I, LLC (formerly known as My-On BDC Blocker, LLC), GSBD Blocker II, LLC, GSBD Wine I, LLC, GSBD Blocker III, LLC, GSBD Blocker IV, LLC, GSBD Blocker V, LLC, MMLC Blocker I, LLC, MMLC Blocker II, LLC, MMLC Wine I, LLC, and MMLC Blocker III, LLC. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\n \n\n\n98\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nRevenue Recognition\n \n\n\nThe Company records its investment transactions on a trade date basis, which is the date when the Company assumes the risks for gains and losses related to that instrument. Realized gains and losses are based on the specific identification method.\n \n\n\nInterest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on an accrual basis. Discounts and premiums to par value on investments purchased are accreted and amortized into interest income over the life of the respective investment using the effective interest method. Loan origination fees, original issue discount (\u201cOID\u201d) and market discounts or premiums are capitalized and amortized into interest income using the effective interest method or straight-line method, as applicable. Exit fees that are receivable upon repayment of a loan or debt security are amortized into interest income over the life of the respective investment. Upon prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment premiums, unamortized upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts are recorded as interest income, for which the Company has earned the following:\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2019\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrepayment premiums\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,224\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,822\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,925\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccelerated amortization of upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n54,467\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n9,494\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,573\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFees received from portfolio companies (directors\u2019 fees, consulting fees, administrative fees, tax advisory fees and other similar compensation) are paid to the Company, unless, to the extent required by applicable law or exemptive relief, if any, therefrom, the Company only receives its allocable portion of such fees when invested in the same portfolio company as another account managed by the Investment Adviser.\n \n\n\nDividend income on preferred equity investments is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies and on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Interest and dividend income are presented net of withholding tax, if any.\n \n\n\nCertain investments may have contractual payment-in-kind (\u201cPIK\u201d) interest or dividends. PIK represents accrued interest or accumulated dividends that are added to the principal amount or shares (if equity) of the investment on the respective interest or dividend payment dates rather than being paid in cash and generally becomes due at maturity or upon the investment being called by the issuer. PIK is recorded as interest or dividend income, as applicable. If at any point the Company believes PIK is not expected to be realized, the investment generating PIK will be placed on non-accrual status. When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued, uncapitalized interest or dividends are generally reversed through interest or dividend income.\n \n\n\nCertain structuring fees, amendment fees, syndication fees and commitment fees are recorded as other income when earned. Administrative agent fees received by the Company are recorded as other income when the services are rendered over time.\n \n\n\nNon-Accrual Investments\n \n\n\nInvestments are placed on non-accrual status when it is probable that principal, interest or dividends will not be collected according to the contractual terms. Accrued interest or dividends generally are reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Interest or dividend payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management\u2019s judgment. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest or dividends are paid and, in management\u2019s judgment, principal and interest or dividend payments are likely to remain current. The Company may make exceptions to this treatment if an investment has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had certain investments held in portfolio companies on non-accrual status, which represented 2.5% and 1.8% of the total investments (excluding investments in money market funds, if any) at amortized cost and at fair value. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had certain investments held in four portfolio companies on non-accrual status, which represented 0.7% and 0.3% of the total investments (excluding investments in money market funds, if any) at amortized cost and at fair value.\n \n\n\n99\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nInvestments\n \n\n\nThe Company carries its investments in accordance with ASC Topic 820, \nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures\n (\u201cASC 820\u201d), issued by the FASB, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is generally based on quoted market prices provided by independent pricing services, broker or dealer quotations or alternative price sources. In the absence of quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations or alternative price sources, investments are measured at fair value as determined by the board of directors (the \u201cBoard of Directors\u201d) within the meaning of the Investment Company Act.\n \n\n\nDue to the inherent uncertainties of valuation, certain estimated fair values may differ significantly from the values that would have been realized had a ready market for these investments existed, and these differences could be material. See Note 5 \u201cFair Value Measurement\u201d.\n \n\n\nThe Company generally invests in illiquid securities, including debt and equity investments, of middle-market companies. The Board of Directors has delegated to the Investment Adviser day-to-day responsibility for implementing and maintaining internal controls and procedures related to the valuation of the Company\u2019s portfolio investments. Under valuation procedures adopted by the Board of Directors, market quotations are generally used to assess the value of the investments for which market quotations are readily available. The Investment Adviser obtains these market quotations from independent pricing services or at the bid prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers, if available; otherwise from a principal market maker or a primary market dealer. To assess the continuing appropriateness of pricing sources and methodologies, the Investment Adviser regularly performs price verification procedures and issues challenges as necessary to independent pricing services or brokers, and any differences are reviewed in accordance with the valuation procedures. If the Board of Directors or Investment Adviser has a bona fide reason to believe any such market quotation does not reflect the fair value of an investment, it may independently value such investment in accordance with valuation procedures for investments for which market quotations are not readily available.\n \n\n\nWith respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or for which market quotations are deemed not reflective of the fair value, the valuation procedures adopted by the Board of Directors contemplate a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\n \n\n\n(1)\nThe quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser responsible for the portfolio investment; \n\n\n(2)\nThe Board of Directors also engages independent valuation firms (the \u201cIndependent Valuation Advisors\u201d) to provide independent valuations of the investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of an investment. The Independent Valuation Advisors independently value such investments using quantitative and qualitative information provided by the investment professionals of the Investment Adviser and the portfolio companies as well as any market quotations obtained from independent pricing services, brokers, dealers or market dealers. The Independent Valuation Advisors also provide analyses to support their valuation methodology and calculations. The Independent Valuation Advisors provide an opinion on a final range of values on such investments to the Board of Directors or the Audit Committee. The Independent Valuation Advisors define fair value in accordance with ASC 820 and utilize valuation approaches including the market approach, the income approach or both. A portion of the portfolio is reviewed on a quarterly basis, and all investments in the portfolio for which market quotations are not readily available, or are readily available, but deemed not reflective of the fair value of an investment, are reviewed at least annually by an Independent Valuation Advisor; \n\n\n(3)\nThe Independent Valuation Advisors\u2019 preliminary valuations are reviewed by the Investment Adviser and the Valuation Oversight Group (\u201cVOG\u201d), a team that is part of the Controllers Department within the Finance Division of Goldman Sachs. The Independent Valuation Advisors\u2019 valuation ranges are compared to the Investment Adviser\u2019s valuations to ensure the Investment Adviser\u2019s valuations are reasonable. VOG presents the valuations to the Asset Management Private Investment Valuation and Side Pocket Working Group of the Asset Management Valuation Committee, which is comprised of representatives from GSAM who are independent of the investment decision making process; \n\n\n(4)\nThe Asset Management Valuation Committee ratifies fair valuations and makes recommendations to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors; \n\n\n(5)\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors reviews valuation information provided by the Asset Management Division Valuation Committee, the Investment Adviser and the Independent Valuation Advisors. The Audit Committee then assesses such valuation recommendations; and \n\n\n(6)\nThe Board of Directors discusses the valuations and, within the meaning of the Investment Company Act, determines the fair value of the investments in good faith, based on the inputs of the Investment Adviser, the Independent Valuation Advisors and the Audit Committee. \n\n\nMoney Market Funds\n \n\n\nInvestments in money market funds are valued at NAV per share. See Note 3 \u201cSignificant Agreements and Related Party Transactions.\u201d\n \n\n\n100\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nCash\n \n\n\nCash consists of deposits held at a custodian bank. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company held an aggregate cash balance of $33,764 and $32,137. Foreign currency of $2,614 and $1,831 (acquisition cost of $2,760 and $1,765) is included in cash as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\n \n\n\nForeign Currency Translation\n \n\n\nAmounts denominated in foreign currencies are translated into USD on the following basis: (i) investments and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into USD based upon currency exchange rates effective on the last business day of the period; and (ii) purchases and sales of investments, borrowings and repayments of such borrowings, income, and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into USD based upon currency exchange rates prevailing on the transaction dates.\n \n\n\nThe Company does not isolate the portion of the results of operations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from fluctuations arising from changes in market prices of securities held. Such fluctuations are included within the net realized and unrealized gains or losses on investments. Fluctuations arising from the translation of non-investment assets and liabilities are included with the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on foreign currency translations on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n \n\n\nForeign security and currency translations may involve certain considerations and risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. companies and U.S. government securities. These risks include, but are not limited to, currency fluctuations and revaluations and future adverse political, social and economic developments, which could cause investments in foreign markets to be less liquid and prices more volatile than those of comparable U.S. companies or U.S. government securities.\n \n\n\nDerivatives\n \n\n\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the Company\u2019s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies. In a foreign currency forward contract, the Company agrees to receive or deliver a fixed quantity of one currency for another, at a pre-determined price at a future date. Forward foreign currency contracts are marked-to-market at the applicable forward rate. Unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on foreign currency forward contracts are recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities by counterparty on a net basis, not taking into account collateral posted which is recorded separately, if applicable. Notional amounts of foreign currency forward contract assets and liabilities are presented separately on the Consolidated Schedules of Investments. Purchases and settlements of foreign currency forward contracts having the same settlement date and counterparty are generally settled net and any realized gains or losses are recognized on the settlement date. The Company does not utilize hedge accounting and as such, the Company recognizes its derivatives at fair value with changes in the net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on foreign currency forward contracts recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n \n\n\nIncome Taxes\n \n\n\nThe Company recognizes tax positions in its consolidated financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. A position that meets this standard is measured at the largest amount of benefit that will more likely than not be realized upon settlement. The Company reports any interest expense related to income tax matters in income tax expense, and any income tax penalties under expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n \n\n\nThe Company\u2019s tax positions have been reviewed based on applicable statutes of limitation for tax assessments, which may vary by jurisdiction, and based on such review, the Company has concluded that no additional provision for income tax is required on the consolidated financial statements. The Company is subject to potential examination by certain taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. The Company\u2019s tax positions are subject to ongoing interpretation of laws and regulations by taxing authorities.\n \n\n\nThe Company has elected to be treated as a RIC commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2013. So long as the Company maintains its status as a RIC, it will generally not be required to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on any ordinary income or capital gains that it distributes at least annually to its stockholders as dividends. As a result, any U.S. federal income tax liability related to income earned and distributed by the Company represents obligations of the Company\u2019s stockholders and will not be reflected on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.\n \n\n\nTo maintain its tax treatment as a RIC, the Company must meet specified source-of-income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to its stockholders for each taxable year at least 90% of its investment company taxable income (generally, its net ordinary income plus the excess of its realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction). In order for the Company not to be subject to U.S. federal excise taxes, it must distribute annually an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98% of its net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (ii) 98.2% of its capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year and (iii) any net ordinary income and capital gains in excess of capital losses for preceding years that were not distributed during such years. The Company, at its discretion, may carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year dividends and pay a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on this income. If the Company chooses to do so, this generally would increase expenses and reduce the amount available to be distributed to stockholders. The Company will accrue excise tax on estimated undistributed taxable income as required. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 the Company accrued excise taxes of $1,254, $1,443 and $1,815. As of December 31, 2021, $1,356 of accrued excise taxes remained payable.\n \n\n\n101\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nCertain of the Company\u2019s consolidated subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal and state corporate-level income taxes. Income tax expense, if any, is included under the income category for which it applies on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n \n\n\nDistributions\n \n\n\nDistributions from net investment income and net realized capital gains are determined in accordance with U.S. federal income tax regulations, which may differ from those amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company may pay distributions in excess of its taxable net investment income. This excess would be a tax-free return of capital in the period and reduce the stockholder\u2019s tax basis in its shares. These book/tax differences are either temporary or permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are permanent they are charged or credited to paid-in capital in excess of par or distributable earnings, as appropriate, in the period that the differences arise. Temporary and permanent differences are primarily attributable to differences in the tax treatment of certain loans and the tax characterization of income and non-deductible expenses. These differences are generally determined in conjunction with the preparation of the Company\u2019s annual RIC tax return. Distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The amount to be paid out as a distribution is determined by the Board of Directors each quarter and is generally based upon the earnings estimated by the Investment Adviser. The Company may pay distributions to its stockholders in a year in excess of its net ordinary income and capital gains for that year and, accordingly, a portion of such distributions may constitute a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company intends to timely distribute to its stockholders substantially all of its annual taxable income for each year, except that the Company may retain certain net capital gains for reinvestment and may carry forward taxable income for distribution in the following year and pay any applicable tax. The specific tax characteristics of the Company\u2019s distributions will be reported to stockholders after the end of the calendar year. All distributions will be subject to available funds, and no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to declare such distributions in future periods.\n \n\n\nThe Company has a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of all cash distributions declared by the Board of Directors unless a stockholder elects to \u201copt out\u201d of the plan. As a result, if the Board of Directors declares a cash distribution, then the stockholders who have not \u201copted out\u201d of the dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution. Stockholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will generally be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions and, for this purpose, stockholders receiving distributions in the form of stock will generally be treated as receiving distributions equal to the fair market value of the stock received through the plan; however, since their cash distributions will be reinvested, those stockholders will not receive cash with which to pay any applicable taxes. Due to regulatory considerations, Group Inc. has opted out of the dividend reinvestment plan, and GS & Co. has opted out of the dividend reinvestment plan in respect of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock acquired through any 10b5-1 plan the Company may adopt.\n \n\n\nDeferred Financing and Debt Issuance Costs\n \n\n\nDeferred financing and debt issuance costs consist of fees and expenses paid in connection with the closing of and amendments to the Company\u2019s senior secured revolving credit agreement (as amended, the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d) with Truist Bank, as administrative agent, and Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, the offering of the Company\u2019s 4.50% Convertible Notes due 2022 (the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d), the offering of the Company\u2019s 3.75% Notes due 2025 (the \u201c2025 Notes\u201d), and the offering of the Company\u2019s 2.875% Notes due 2026 (the \u201c2026 Notes\u201d). The aforementioned costs are amortized using the straight-line method over each instrument\u2019s term. Deferred financing costs related to the Revolving Credit Facility are presented separately as an asset on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. Deferred debt issuance costs related to the Convertible Notes, the 2025 Notes, and the 2026 Notes are presented net against the outstanding debt balance on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3.\tSIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\n \n\n\nInvestment Management Agreement\n \n\n\nThe Company has entered into an investment management agreement (the \u201cInvestment Management Agreement\u201d) with the Investment Adviser, pursuant to which the Investment Adviser manages the Company\u2019s investment program and related activities.\n \n\n\nManagement Fee\n \n\n\nThe Company pays the Investment Adviser a management fee (the \u201cManagement Fee\u201d), accrued and payable quarterly in arrears. The Management Fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.00% (0.25% per quarter) of the average value of the Company\u2019s gross assets (excluding cash or cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts) at the end of each of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. The Management Fee for any partial quarter will be appropriately prorated.\n \n\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, Management Fees amounted to $32,611, $16,846 and $14,696 and the Investment Adviser voluntarily agreed to waive $500, $3,806 and $0 of Management Fees. As of December 31, 2021, $8,370 remained payable.\n \n\n\n102\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nIncentive Fee\n \n\n\nThe incentive fee (the \u201cIncentive Fee\u201d) consists of two components that are determined independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. The Incentive Fee is calculated as follows:\n \n\n\nA portion of the Incentive Fee is based on income and a portion is based on capital gains, each as described below. The Investment Adviser is entitled to receive the Incentive Fee based on income if Ordinary Income (as defined below) exceeds a quarterly \u201churdle rate\u201d of 1.75%. For this purpose, the hurdle is computed by reference to the Company\u2019s NAV and does not take into account changes in the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\n \n\n\nThe Incentive Fee based on income is determined and paid quarterly in arrears at the end of each calendar quarter by reference to the Company\u2019s aggregate net investment income, as adjusted as described below, from the calendar quarter then ending and the eleven preceding calendar quarters (such period the \u201cTrailing Twelve Quarters\u201d). The Incentive Fee based on capital gains is determined and paid annually in arrears at the end of each calendar year by reference to an \u201cAnnual Period,\u201d which means the period beginning on January 1 of each calendar year and ending on December 31 of such calendar year or, in the case of the first and last year, the appropriate portion thereof.\n \n\n\nThe hurdle amount for the Incentive Fee based on income is determined on a quarterly basis and is equal to 1.75% multiplied by the Company\u2019s NAV at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. The hurdle amount is calculated after making appropriate adjustments for subscriptions (which includes all of the Company\u2019s issuances of shares of its common stock, including issuances pursuant to its dividend reinvestment plan) and distributions that occurred during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. The Incentive Fee for any partial period will be appropriately prorated.\n \n\n\ni. Quarterly Incentive Fee Based on Income\n \n\n\nFor the portion of the Incentive Fee based on income, the Company pays the Investment Adviser a quarterly Incentive Fee based on the amount by which (A) aggregate net investment income (\u201cOrdinary Income\u201d) in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters exceeds (B) the hurdle amount for such Trailing Twelve Quarters. The amount of the excess of (A) over (B) described in this paragraph for such Trailing Twelve Quarters is referred to as the \u201cExcess Income Amount\u201d. Ordinary Income is net of all fees and expenses, including the Management Fee but excluding any Incentive Fee.\n \n\n\nThe Incentive Fee based on income for each quarter is determined as follows:\n \n\n\n\u2022\nNo Incentive Fee based on income is payable to the Investment Adviser for any calendar quarter for which there is no Excess Income Amount; \n\n\n\u2022\n100% of the Ordinary Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle amount, but is less than or equal to an amount, referred to as the \u201cCatch-up Amount,\u201d determined as the sum of 2.1875% multiplied by the Company\u2019s NAV at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters is included in the calculation of the Incentive Fee based on income; and \n\n\n\u2022\n20% of the Ordinary Income that exceeds the Catch-up Amount is included in the calculation of the Incentive Fee based on income. \n\n\nThe amount of the Incentive Fee based on income that is paid to the Investment Adviser for a particular quarter equals the excess of the Incentive Fee so calculated minus the aggregate Incentive Fees based on income that were paid in respect of the first eleven calendar quarters (or the portion thereof) included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters but not in excess of the Incentive Fee Cap (as described below).\n \n\n\nThe Incentive Fee based on income that is paid to the Investment Adviser for a particular quarter is subject to a cap (the \u201cIncentive Fee Cap\u201d). The Incentive Fee Cap for any quarter is an amount equal to (a) 20% of the Cumulative Net Return (as defined below) during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters minus (b) the aggregate Incentive Fees based on income that were paid in respect of the first eleven calendar quarters (or the portion thereof) included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters.\n \n\n\n\u201cCumulative Net Return\u201d means (x) the Ordinary Income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters minus (y) any Net Capital Loss, if any, in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value, the Company pays no Incentive Fee based on income to the Investment Adviser for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is a positive value but is less than the Incentive Fee based on income that is payable to the Investment Adviser for such quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, the Company pays an Incentive Fee based on income to the Investment Adviser equal to the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is equal to or greater than the Incentive Fee based on income that is payable to the Investment Adviser for such quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, the Company pays an Incentive Fee based on income to the Investment Adviser equal to the Incentive Fee calculated as described above for such quarter without regard to the Incentive Fee Cap.\n \n\n\n103\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u201cNet Capital Loss\u201d in respect of a particular period means the difference, if positive, between (i) aggregate capital losses, whether realized or unrealized, in such period and (ii) aggregate capital gains, whether realized or unrealized, in such period.\n \n\n\nii. Annual Incentive Fee Based on Capital Gains\n \n\n\nThe portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains is calculated on an annual basis. For each Annual Period, the Company pays the Investment Adviser an amount equal to (A) 20% of the difference, if positive, of the sum of the Company\u2019s aggregate realized capital gains, if any, computed net of the Company\u2019s aggregate realized capital losses, if any, and the Company\u2019s aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, in each case from April 1, 2013 until the end of such Annual Period minus (B) the cumulative amount of Incentive Fees based on capital gains previously paid to the Investment Adviser from April 1, 2013. For the avoidance of doubt, unrealized capital appreciation is excluded from the calculation in clause (A) above.\n \n\n\nThe Company accrues, but does not pay, a portion of the Incentive Fee based on capital gains with respect to net unrealized appreciation. Under GAAP, the Company is required to accrue an Incentive Fee based on capital gains that includes net realized capital gains and losses and net unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation on investments held at the end of each period. In calculating the accrual for the Incentive Fee based on capital gains, the Company considers the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, since an Incentive Fee based on capital gains would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee payable under the Investment Management Agreement. This accrual is calculated using the aggregate cumulative realized capital gains and losses and aggregate cumulative unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then the Company records a capital gains incentive fee equal to 20% of such amount, minus the aggregate amount of actual Incentive Fees based on capital gains paid in all prior periods. If such amount is negative, then there is no accrual for such period. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future.\n \n\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, Incentive Fees based on income amounted to $40,697, $35,845 and $9,220. As of December 31, 2021, $760 remained payable. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not accrue or pay any Incentive Fees based on capital gains.\n\n\nIn connection with the Merger, GSAM has agreed to waive a portion of its Incentive Fee based on income to the extent incurred, for a period of nine quarters, commencing with the quarter ended December 31, 2019 and through and including the quarter ending December 31, 2021, otherwise payable by the Company under the Investment Management Agreement by and between the Company and GSAM, as applicable, for each such quarter in an amount sufficient to ensure that the Company\u2019s net investment income per weighted share outstanding for such quarter is at least $0.48 per share. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, GSAM waived $4,544 and $23,070 of Incentive Fees. Additionally, GSAM voluntarily agreed to waive $26,534 and $10,110 of Incentive Fees for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\n \nattributable to the purchase discount resulting from the Merger.\n\n\nAdministration and Custodian Fees\n \n\n\nThe Company has entered into an administration agreement with State Street Bank and Trust Company (the \u201cAdministrator\u201d) under which the Administrator provides various accounting and administrative services to the Company. The Company pays the Administrator fees for its services as it determines to be commercially reasonable in its sole discretion. The Company also reimburses the Administrator for all reasonable expenses. To the extent that the Administrator outsources any of its functions, the Administrator pays any compensation associated with such functions. The Administrator also serves as the Company\u2019s custodian (the \u201cCustodian\u201d).\n \n\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company incurred expenses for services provided by the Administrator and the Custodian of $1,954, $1,151 and $957. As of December 31, 2021, $488 remained payable.\n\n\nTransfer Agent Fees\n \n\n\nThe Company has entered into a transfer agency and services agreement pursuant to which Computershare Trust Company, N.A. serves as the Company\u2019s transfer agent (the \u201cTransfer Agent\u201d), dividend agent and registrar. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company incurred expenses for services provided by the Transfer Agent of $38, $25 and $14. As of December 31, 2021, $1 remained payable.\n\n\nCommon Stock Repurchase Plans\n \n\n\nIn February 2019, the Board of Directors approved a 10b5-1 stock repurchase plan (the \u201c2019 10b5-1 Plan\u201d), which provided for the Company to repurchase up to $25,000 of shares of its common stock if the stock traded below the most recently announced NAV per share, subject to limitations. The 2019 10b5-1 Plan took effect on March 18, 2019, was temporarily suspended on December 9, 2019 and expired on March 18, 2020. The Company did not repurchase any of its common stock pursuant to the 2019 10b5-1 Plan or otherwise.\n\n\nIn November 2020, the Board of Directors authorized the adoption of a new common stock repurchase plan (the \u201c2020 10b5-1 Plan\u201d), which provided for the Company to repurchase up to $75,000 of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock if the stock traded below the most recently announced quarter-end NAV per share, subject to limitations.

As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, there were $585 and $12 included within Accrued expenses and other liabilities paid by the Investment Adviser and its affiliates on behalf of the Company.\n \n\n\nCo-investment Activity\n \n\n\nIn certain circumstances, negotiated co-investments by the Company and other funds managed by the Investment Adviser may be made only pursuant to an order from the SEC permitting the Company to do so. On January 4, 2017, the SEC granted GS PMMC and GS MMLC (which was merged with GS BDC on October 12, 2020) and us exemptive relief to co-invest with other funds managed by the GSAM Credit Alternatives investment team in a manner consistent with our investment objectives, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. Additionally, if our Investment Adviser forms other funds in the future (such as GS PMMC II and GS MMLC II), we and such other funds may co-invest on a concurrent basis with such other affiliates, subject to compliance with the exemptive relief, applicable regulations and regulatory guidance, as well as applicable allocation procedures. The GSAM Credit Alternatives Team is comprised of investment professionals dedicated to the Company\u2019s investment strategy and other funds that share a similar investment strategy with the Company, who are responsible for identifying investment opportunities, conducting research and due diligence on prospective investments, negotiating and structuring the Company\u2019s investments and monitoring and servicing the Company\u2019s investments, together with investment professionals who are primarily focused on investment strategies in syndicated, liquid credit. Under the terms of the Exemptive Relief, a \u201crequired majority\u201d (as defined in Section 57(o) of the Investment Company Act) of the Company\u2019s independent directors must make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair to the Company and the Company\u2019s stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of the Company or its stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of the Company\u2019s stockholders and is consistent with the then-current investment objectives and strategies of the Company. As a result of the Exemptive Relief, there could be significant overlap in the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and the investment portfolios of the aforementioned funds and/or other funds established by the GSAM Credit Alternatives Team that could avail themselves of the Exemptive Relief.\n \n\n\n4.\tINVESTMENTS\n \n\n\nThe Company\u2019s investments (excluding investments in money

received to sell an asset or would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (i.e., the exit price).\n\n\nThe fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The levels used for classifying investments are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\n \n\n\nBasis of Fair Value Measurement\n \n\n\nLevel 1 \u2013 Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices available in active markets for identical instruments as of the reporting date. The types of financial instruments included in Level 1 include unrestricted securities, including equities and derivatives, listed in active markets.\n \n\n\nLevel 2 \u2013 Inputs to the valuation methodology are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. The types of financial instruments in this category include less liquid and restricted securities listed in active markets, securities traded in other than active markets, government and agency securities and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on observable inputs.\n \n\n\nLevel 3 \u2013 Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to overall fair value measurement. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. Financial instruments that are included in this category include investments in privately held entities and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on unobservable inputs.\n \n\n\nA financial instrument\u2019s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Note 2 \u201cSignificant Accounting Policies\u201d should be read in conjunction with the information outlined below.\n \n\n\nThe table below presents the valuation techniques and the nature of significant inputs generally used in determining the fair value of Level 2 and Level 3 Instruments.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 2 Instruments\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nValuation Techniques and Significant Inputs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquity and Fixed Income\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe types of instruments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active but are valued based on quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency include commercial paper, most government agency obligations, most corporate debt securities, certain mortgage-backed securities, certain bank loans, less liquid publicly listed equities, certain state and municipal obligations, certain money market instruments and certain loan commitments.\n \n\u00a0\nValuations of Level 2 Equity and Fixed Income instruments can be verified to quoted prices, broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Consideration is given to the nature of the quotations (e.g. indicative or firm) and the relationship of recent market activity to the prices provided from alternative pricing sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerivative Contracts\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOTC derivatives (both centrally cleared and bilateral) are valued using market transactions and other market evidence whenever possible, including market-based inputs to models, calibration to market-clearing transactions, broker or dealer quotations, or other alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Where models are used, the selection of a particular model to value an OTC derivative depends upon the contractual terms of, and specific risks inherent in, the instrument, as well as the availability of pricing information in the market. The Company generally uses similar models to value similar instruments. Valuation models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, voluntary and involuntary prepayment rates, loss severity rates and correlations of such inputs. For OTC derivatives that trade in liquid markets, model inputs can generally be verified and model selection does not involve significant management judgment. OTC derivatives are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy when significant inputs are corroborated by market evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n108\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 3 Instruments\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nValuation Techniques and Significant Inputs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBank Loans, Corporate Debt, and Other Debt\nObligations\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nValuations are generally based on discounted cash flow techniques, for which the significant inputs are the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, market yields and recovery assumptions. The significant inputs are generally determined based on relative value analyses, which incorporate comparisons both to credit default swaps that reference the same underlying credit risk and to other debt instruments for the same issuer for which observable prices or broker quotes are available. Other valuation methodologies are used as appropriate including market comparables, transactions in similar instruments and recovery/liquidation analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquity\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRecent third-party investments or pending transactions are considered to be the best evidence for any change in fair value. When these are not available, the following valuation methodologies are used, as appropriate and available (i) Transactions in similar instruments; (ii) Discounted cash flow techniques; (iii) Third party appraisals; and (iv) Industry multiples and public comparables.\nEvidence includes recent or pending reorganizations (for example, merger proposals, tender offers and debt restructurings) and significant changes in financial metrics, including (i) Current financial performance as compared to projected performance; (ii) Capitalization rates and multiples; and (iii) Market yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe tables below present the ranges of significant unobservable inputs used to value the Company\u2019s Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. These ranges represent the significant unobservable inputs that were used in the valuation of each type of instrument, but they do not represent a range of values for any one instrument. For example, the lowest yield in 1st Lien/Senior Secured Debt is appropriate for valuing that specific debt investment, but may not be appropriate for valuing any other debt investments in this asset class. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs presented below do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of the Company\u2019s Level 3 assets.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 3 Instruments\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFair Value\n(1)(2)\n\n\nValuation Techniques\n(3)\n\n\nSignificant Unobservable\nInputs\n\n\nRange of Significant\nUnobservable Inputs\n(4)\n\n\nWeighted\nAverage\n(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBank Loans, Corporate Debt, and Other Debt Obligations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1st Lien/Senior Secured Debt\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02,271,598\n \n\n\nDiscounted cash flows\n\n\nDiscount Rate\n\n\n7.1% -

Borrowings denominated in non-USD bear interest of LIBOR plus a margin of either 2.00%, 1.875% or 1.75% (subject to the conditions applicable to borrowings denominated in USD that bear interest based on LIBOR) plus, in the case of borrowings denominated in Pound Sterling (GBP) only, an additional 0.1193% credit adjustment spread. With respect to borrowings denominated in USD, the Company may elect either LIBOR, or an alternative base rate at the time of borrowing, and such borrowings may be converted from one benchmark to another at any time, subject to certain conditions. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears. The Company pays a fee of 0.375% per annum on committed but undrawn amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility, payable quarterly in arrears. Any amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility will mature, and all accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable, on August 13, 2026.\n \n\n\n111\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nThe Revolving Credit Facility may be guaranteed by certain of the Company\u2019s domestic subsidiaries, including any that are formed or acquired by the Company in the future.

The Additional Convertible Notes have identical terms, are fungible with and are part of the Initial Convertible Notes.\n \n\n\nThe Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, National Association, as Trustee (as successor to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d)). The Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing on April 1, 2017. The Convertible Notes will mature on April 1, 2022, unless repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. In certain circumstances, the Convertible Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of the Company\u2019s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, based on a conversion rate of 41.1666 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock per one thousand dollars principal amount of Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $24.29 per share of common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments and the other terms of the indenture governing the Convertible Notes. The conversion price of $24.29 is approximately 9.1% above the $22.26 per share closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock on September 27, 2016 and 15.7% above the $20.99 per share closing price of our common stock on June 26, 2018. The Company will not have the right to redeem the Convertible Notes prior to maturity.\n\n\nHolders were permitted to convert their notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding October 1, 2021 only under the following: (1) during any calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of the Company\u2019s common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the \u201cmeasurement period\u201d) in which the trading price per one thousand dollars principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company\u2019s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after October 1, 2021, until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any of the foregoing circumstances.\n \n\n\nThe Convertible Notes are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 470-20, \nDebt with Conversion and Other Options\n. Upon conversion of any of the Convertible Notes, the Company intends to pay the outstanding principal amount in cash and, to the extent that the conversion value exceeds the principal amount, has the option to pay the excess amount in cash or shares of the Company\u2019s common stock (or a combination of cash and shares), subject to the requirements of the indenture governing the Convertible Notes. The Company has determined that the embedded conversion options in the Convertible Notes are not required to be separately accounted for as derivatives under ASC Topic 815,\n \n\n\n112\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nDerivatives and Hedging.\n At the time of issuance, the values of the debt and equity components of the Initial Convertible Notes and Additional Convertible Notes were approximately 99.4% and 0.6%, and 97.9% and 2.1%.\n \n\n\nThe OID equal to the equity component of the Convertible Notes was recorded in \u201cpaid-in capital in excess of par\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.

Master Agreement (\u201cISDA Master Agreement\u201d) or a similar agreement with its derivative counterparties. An ISDA Master Agreement is a bilateral agreement between the Company and a counterparty that governs OTC derivatives, including foreign currency forward contracts, and typically contains, among other things, collateral posting terms and netting provisions in the event of a default and/or termination event. The provisions of the ISDA Master Agreement typically permit a single net payment in the event of a default (close-out netting) or similar event, including the bankruptcy or insolvency of the counterparty.\n \n\n\nFor financial reporting purposes, cash collateral that has been pledged to cover obligations of the Company and cash collateral received from the counterparty, if any, is included on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as due to/due from broker. The Company minimizes counterparty credit risk by only entering into agreements with counterparties that they believe to be of good standing and by monitoring the financial stability of those counterparties.\n \n\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company\u2019s average USD notional exposure to foreign currency forward contracts was $2,829 and $3,435.\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s net exposure to foreign currency forward contracts by counterparty that are subject to ISDA Master Agreements or similar agreements presented on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities was as follows:\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGross Amount of\nAssets\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGross Amount of\n(Liabilities)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNet Amount of Assets or\n(Liabilities)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCollateral (Received)\nPledged\n\u00a0(1)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNet Amounts \n(2)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 31, 2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBank of America, N.A.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n100\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n100\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n100\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 31, 2020\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBank of America, N.A.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n(355\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n(355\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n(355\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(1)\nAmount excludes excess cash collateral paid. \n\n\n(2)\nNet amount represents the net amount due (to) from counterparty in the event of a default based on the contractual setoff rights under the agreement.

Any exposure to the Company under these arrangements could involve future claims that may be made against the Company. Currently, no such claims exist or are expected to arise and, accordingly, the Company has not accrued any liability in connection with such indemnifications.\n \n\n\n116\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n9.\tNET ASSETS\n \n\n\nEquity Issuances\n \n\n\nOn October 12, 2020, in connection with the Merger, the Company issued an aggregate of 61,037,311 shares of Common Stock to former GS MMLC stockholders. There were no equity issuances of the Company\u2019s common stock during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2019.\n \n\n\nDistributions\n \n\n\nThe Company has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of all cash distributions declared by the Board of Directors, unless a stockholder elects to \u201copt out\u201d of the plan. As a result, if the Board of Directors declares a cash distribution, then the stockholders who have not \u201copted out\u201d of the dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution. The shares distributed by the Transfer Agent in the Company\u2019s dividend reinvestment plan are either through (i) newly issued shares or (ii) acquired by the Transfer Agent through the purchase of outstanding shares on the open market. If, on the payment date for any distribution, the most recently computed NAV per share as of the dividend payment date is equal to or less than the closing market price plus estimated per share fees, the Transfer Agent will invest the distribution amount in newly issued shares. Otherwise, the Transfer Agent will invest the dividend amount in shares acquired by purchasing shares on the open market. The following table summarizes the distributions declared on shares of the Company\u2019s common stock and shares distributed pursuant to the dividend reinvestment plan to stockholders who had not opted out of the dividend reinvestment plan:\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate Declared\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRecord Date\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPayment

ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Company\u2019s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Based on its analysis of its tax position for all open tax years (the current and prior years, as applicable), the Company has concluded that it does not have any uncertain tax positions that met the recognition or measurement criteria of ASC 740. Such open tax years remain subject to examination and adjustment by tax authorities.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n118\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n12.\tFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n

MERGER WITH GS MMLC\n\n\nOn October 12, 2020, the Company completed its merger with GS MMLC pursuant to the Merger Agreement, dated as of June 11, 2020. The Company was the accounting survivor of the Merger.  At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of GS MMLC common stock was converted into the right to receive, for each share of GS MMLC common stock, that number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, with a NAV equal to the NAV per share of GS MMLC common stock, in each case calculated as of October 9, 2020. As a result, the Company issued an aggregate of 61,037,311 shares of Common Stock to the former GS MMLC stockholders.\n \n\n\nThe Merger was accounted for as an asset acquisition in accordance with ASC 805-50, Business Combinations\u2014Related Issues. The consideration paid to GS MMLC\u2019s stockholders was less than the aggregate fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which resulted in a purchase discount (the \u201cpurchase discount\u201d). The purchase discount was allocated to the cost of GS MMLC investments acquired by the Company on a pro-rata basis based on their relative fair values as of the closing date. Immediately following the Merger with GS MMLC, the investments were marked to their respective fair values and, as a result, the purchase discount allocated to the cost basis of the investments acquired was immediately recognized as unrealized appreciation on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.  The purchase discount allocated to the loan investments acquired will amortize over the life of each respective loan through interest income with a corresponding adjustment recorded as unrealized depreciation on such loans acquired through their ultimate disposition. The purchase discount allocated to equity investments acquired will not amortize over the life of such investments through interest income and, assuming no subsequent change to the fair value of the equity investments acquired and disposition of such equity investments at fair value, the Company will recognize a realized gain with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation on disposition of such equity investments acquired.  The Merger was considered a tax-free reorganization and the Company has elected to carry forward the historical cost basis of the GS MMLC investments for tax purposes.\n\n\n119\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nThe following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of the Merger:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon stock issued by the Company\n(1)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n866,201\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal purchase price\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n866,201\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssets acquired:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestments, at fair value (amortized cost of $1,741,300)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,691,263\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash and cash equivalents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n177,576\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther assets\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n18,986\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal assets acquired\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,887,825\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiabilities assumed:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebt\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n843,701\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution payable\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n75,000\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther liabilities\n(2)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n18,963\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal liabilities assumed\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n937,664\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet assets acquired\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n950,161\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal purchase discount\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n(83,960\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(1)\nBased on the market price at closing of $15.26, adjusted for a discount to reflect the impact of transfer restrictions applicable to the shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock issued to GS MMLC stockholders pursuant to the terms of the Merger, and the 61,037,311 shares of common stock issued by the Company. \n\n\n(2)\nIncludes $4,159 of management fees and $6,672 of incentive fees accrued by GS MMLC pursuant to an investment management agreement between GS MMLC and Investment Adviser, which was terminated upon the closing of the Merger.

CONTRO\nLS AND PROCEDURES\n \n\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.\n As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2021. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\n \n\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\n There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n \n\n\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\n Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in \nInternal Control\u2014Integrated Framework\n (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021.\n \n\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n \n\n\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.\n \n\n\nITEM 9B.

You should carefully consider these risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this report, before you decide whether to make an investment in our securities. The risks set forth below are not the only risks we face, and we may face other risks that we have not yet identified, which we do not currently deem material or which are not yet predictable. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such case, our NAV and the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\n\n\nSummary Risk Factors\n\n\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. The following is a summary of certain of the principal risks that should be carefully considered before investing in our securities:\n\n\nMarket Developments and General Business Environment\n \n\n\n\u2022\nPolitical, social and economic uncertainty, including uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic, creates and exacerbates risks.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe capital markets are currently in a period of disruption and economic uncertainty. Such market conditions have materially and adversely affected debt and equity capital markets, which have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our business and operations.\n\n\nLegal and Regulatory\n\n\n\u2022\nOur operation as a BDC imposes numerous constraints on us and significantly reduces our operating flexibility. In addition, if we fail to maintain our status as a BDC, we might be regulated as a closed-end investment company, which would subject us to additional regulatory restrictions.\n\n\n\u2022\nWe will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on all of our income if we are unable to maintain our qualification for tax treatment as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\n\n\n\u2022\nRegulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital. These constraints may hinder our Investment Adviser\u2019s ability to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities and to achieve our investment objective.\n\n\n\u2022\nWe incur significant costs as a result of being subject to the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act. \n\n\n\u2022\nEfforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act involve significant expenditures, and noncompliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may adversely affect us and the market price of our securities.\n\n\n\u2022\nChanges in laws or regulations governing our operations or the operations of our portfolio companies, changes in the interpretation thereof or newly enacted laws or regulations, or any failure by us or our portfolio companies to comply with these laws or regulations, could require changes to certain of our or our portfolio companies\u2019 business practices, negatively impact our or our portfolio companies\u2019 operations, cash flows or financial condition, impose additional costs on us or our portfolio companies or otherwise adversely affect our business or the business of our portfolio companies.\n\n\n\u2022\nWe cannot predict how new tax legislation will affect us, our investments, or our stockholders, and any such legislation could adversely affect our business.\n\n\n\u2022\nOur ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates is restricted.\n\n\n\u2022\nOur activities may be limited as a result of potentially being deemed to be controlled by a bank holding company.\n\n\n\u2022\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission rules may have a negative impact on us and our Investment Adviser.\n\n\n\u2022\nOur ability to enter into transactions involving derivatives and financial commitment transactions may be limited.\n\n\n\u2022\nCertain investors are limited in their ability to make significant investments in us.\n\n\nCompetition\n\n\n\u2022\nWe are dependent upon management personnel of our Investment Adviser for our future success.\n\n\n\u2022\nWe operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities.\n\n\nOperational\n\n\n\u2022\nWe are dependent on information systems, and systems failures, as well as operating failures, could significantly disrupt our business, which may, in turn, negatively affect our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. \n\n\n\u2022\nTerrorist attacks, acts of war, global health emergencies or natural disasters may impact the businesses in which we invest and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\n\n27\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u2022\nCybersecurity risks and cyber incidents may adversely affect our business or the business of our portfolio companies by causing a disruption to our operations or the operations of our portfolio companies, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information or the confidential information of our portfolio companies and/or damage to our business relationships or the business relationships of our portfolio companies, all of which could negatively impact the business, financial condition and operating results of us or our portfolio companies.\n\n\nOur Business and Structure\n\n\n\u2022\nGlobal economic, political and market conditions may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our revenue growth and profitability.\n\n\n\u2022\nOur Investment Adviser, its principals, investment professionals and employees and the members of its BDC Investment Committee have certain conflicts of interest.\n\n\n\u2022\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 financial and other interests may incentivize Goldman Sachs to favor other Accounts.\n\n\n\u2022\nOur financial condition and results of operations depend on our Investment Adviser\u2019s ability to manage our future growth effectively.\n\n\n\u2022\nOur ability to grow depends on our ability to raise additional capital.\n\n\n\u2022\nWe borrow money, which may magnify the potential for gain or loss and may increase the risk of investing in us.\n\n\n\u2022\nOur Investment Adviser will be paid the Management Fee even if the value of stockholders' investments declines and our Investment Adviser\u2019s Incentive Fee may create incentives for it to make certain kinds of investments.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe Incentive Fee based on income takes into account our past performance.\n\n\n\u2022\nPotential conflicts of interest with other businesses of Goldman Sachs could impact our investment returns.\n\n\n\u2022\nGoldman Sachs has influence, and may continue to exert influence, over our management and affairs and over most votes requiring stockholder approval.\n\n\n\u2022\nOur Board of Directors may change our investment objective, operating policies and strategies without prior notice or stockholder approval.\n\n\n\u2022\nOur Investment Adviser can resign on 60 days\u2019 notice. We may not be able to find a suitable replacement within that time, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations.\n\n\n\u2022\nOur Investment Adviser\u2019s responsibilities and its liability to us are limited under the Investment Management Agreement, which may lead our Investment Adviser to act in a riskier manner on our behalf than it would when acting for its own account.\n\n\n\u2022\nWe may experience fluctuations in our quarterly results.\n\n\n\u2022\nWe are exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates.\n\n\nOur Portfolio Company Investments\n\n\n\u2022\nOur investments are very risky and highly speculative.\n\n\n\u2022\nInvesting in middle-market companies involves a number of significant risks.\n\n\n\u2022\nMany of our portfolio securities may not have a readily available market price, and we value these securities at fair value as determined in good faith under procedures adopted by our Board of Directors, which valuation is inherently subjective and may not reflect what we may actually realize for the sale of the investment.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business.\n\n\n\u2022\nOur portfolio may be focused in a limited number of portfolio companies, which will subject us to a risk of significant loss if any of these companies default on their obligations under any of their debt instruments or if there is a downturn in a particular industry.\n\n\n\u2022\nWe may not be in a position to exercise control over our portfolio companies or to prevent decisions by management of our portfolio companies that could decrease the value of our investments.\n\n\n\u2022\nWe may be subject to risks associated with investments in real estate loans.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe effect of global climate change may impact the operations of our portfolio companies.\n\n\n\u2022\nOur failure to make follow-on investments in our portfolio companies could impair the value of our portfolio.\n\n\n\u2022\nOur portfolio companies may prepay loans, which may reduce stated yields in the future if the capital returned cannot be invested in transactions with equal or greater expected yields.\n\n\n\u2022\nInflation may adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of our Portfolio Companies.\n\n\n\u2022\nInvestments in common and preferred equity securities, many of which are illiquid with no readily available market, involve a substantial degree of risk.\n\n\n\u2022\nBy originating loans to companies that are experiencing significant financial or business difficulties, we may be exposed to distressed lending risks.\n\n\n\u2022\nWe may be exposed to special risks associated with bankruptcy cases.\n\n\n\u2022\nDeclines in market prices and liquidity in the corporate debt markets can result in significant net unrealized depreciation of our portfolio, which in turn would affect our results of operations.\n\n\n\u2022\nEconomic recessions or downturns could impair our portfolio companies and harm our operating results.\n\n\n\u2022\nOur portfolio companies may have incurred or issued, or may in the future incur or issue, debt or equity securities that rank equally with, or senior to, our investments in such companies, which could have an adverse effect on us in any liquidation of the portfolio company.\n\n\n28\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u2022\nOur portfolio companies may be highly leveraged.\n\n\n\u2022\nOur investments in non-U.S. companies may involve significant risks in addition to the risks inherent in U.S. investments.\n\n\n\u2022\nWe may expose ourselves to risks if we engage in hedging transactions.\n\n\n\u2022\nWe may form one or more CLOs, which may subject us to certain structured financing risks.\n\n\nOur Securities\n\n\n\u2022\nInvesting in our securities involves an above average degree of risk.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe market price of our securities may fluctuate significantly.\n\n\n\u2022\nShares of closed-end investment companies, including BDCs, frequently trade at a discount to their NAV per share.\n\n\n\u2022\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\n\n\n\u2022\nOur stockholders may experience dilution upon the conversion of our Convertible Notes.\n\n\n\u2022\nOur stockholders will experience dilution in their ownership percentage if they opt out of our dividend reinvestment plan.\n\n\n\u2022\nOur stockholders that do not opt out of our dividend reinvestment plan should generally expect to have current tax liabilities without receiving cash to pay such liabilities.\n\n\n\u2022\nWe may in the future determine to issue preferred stock, which could adversely affect the market value of our common stock.\n\n\n\u2022\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d), as well as other aspects of our structure, including the substantial ownership interest of Group Inc., could deter takeover attempts and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\n\n\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to pay you distributions on our common stock or preferred stock, our distributions to you may not grow over time and a portion of our distributions to you may be a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe tax treatment of a non-U.S. stockholder in its jurisdiction of tax residence will depend entirely on the laws of such jurisdiction, and may vary considerably from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\n\n\n\u2022\nWe may have difficulty paying our required distributions if we recognize taxable income before or without receiving cash representing such income.\n\n\n\u2022\nOur stockholders may receive shares of our common stock or preferred stock as distributions, which could result in adverse tax consequences to them.\n\n\n\u2022\nIf we are not treated as a \u201cpublicly offered regulated investment company,\u201d as defined in the Code, U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts or estates will be taxed as though they received a distribution of some of our expenses.\n\n\n\u2022\nNon-U.S. stockholders may be subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax on dividends we pay.\n\n\n\u2022\nPurchases of our common stock pursuant to any 10b5-1 plan or otherwise may result in the price of our common stock being higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market.\n\n\n\u2022\nPurchases of our common stock by us under any 10b5-1 plan or otherwise may result in dilution to our NAV per share.\n\n\n\u2022\nTo the extent OID and PIK interest constitute a portion of our income, we will be exposed to typical risks associated with such income being required to be included in taxable and accounting income prior to receipt of cash representing such income.\n\n\n\u2022\nTerms relating to redemption may materially adversely affect your return on any debt securities that we may issue.\n\n\n\u2022\nOur credit ratings may not reflect all risks of an investment in our debt securities.\n\n\n\u2022\nHolders of any preferred stock we might issue would have the right to elect members of the board of directors and class voting rights on certain matters.\n\n\n\u2022\nThere is a risk that investors in our equity securities may not receive distributions or that our distributions may not grow over time and that investors in our debt securities may not receive all of the interest income to which they are entitled.\n\n\nMarket Developments and General Business Environment\n\n\nPolitical, social and economic uncertainty, including uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic, creates and exacerbates risks.\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created disruptions in supply chains and economic activity, contributed to labor difficulties and is having a particularly adverse impact on transportation, hospitality, tourism, entertainment and other industries, which may in the future adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will negatively affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations will depend on future developments, including the emergence of new variants of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of vaccines and treatments over the long term and against new variants, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\n\n\nWhile financial markets have rebounded from the significant declines that occurred early in the pandemic and global economic conditions generally improved in 2021, certain of the circumstances that arose or became more pronounced after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic persisted in 2021, including (i) relatively weak consumer confidence; (ii) low levels of the federal funds rate and yields on U.S. Treasury securities which, at times, were near zero; (iii) ongoing heightened credit risk with regard to industries that have been most severely impacted by the pandemic, including, at times, oil and gas, gaming and lodging, and airlines; (iv) higher cyber security, information security and operational risks; and (v) interruptions in the supply chain that have adversely affected many businesses and have contributed to higher rates of inflation.\n\n\n29\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nDepending on the duration and severity of the pandemic going forward, as well as the effects of the pandemic on consumer and corporate confidence, the conditions noted above could continue for an extended period and other adverse developments may occur or reoccur, including (i) the decline in value and performance of us and our portfolio companies', (ii) the ability of our borrowers to continue to meet loan covenants or repay loans provided by us on a timely basis or at all, which may require us to restructure our investments or write down the value of our investments, (iii) our ability to comply with the covenants and other terms of our debt obligations and to repay such obligations, on a timely basis or at all, (iv) our ability to comply with certain regulatory requirements, such as asset coverage requirements under the 1940 Act, (v) our ability maintain our distributions at their current level or to pay them at all or (vi) our ability to source, manage and divest investments and achieve our investment objectives, all of which could result in significant losses to us. We will also be negatively affected if the operations and effectiveness of any of our portfolio companies (or any of the key personnel or service providers of the foregoing) is compromised or if necessary or beneficial systems and processes are disrupted. See \u201c\u2014The capital markets are currently in a period of disruption and economic uncertainty. Such market conditions have materially and adversely affected debt and equity capital markets, which have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our business and operations.\u201d\n \n\n\nGovernmental authorities worldwide have taken increased measures to stabilize the markets and support economic growth. The continued success of these measures is unknown and they may not be sufficient to address future market dislocations or avert severe and prolonged reductions in economic activity.\n\n\nIn addition, disruptions in the capital markets caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have increased the spread between the yields realized on risk-free and higher risk securities, resulting in illiquidity in parts of the capital markets. These and future market disruptions and/or illiquidity can be expected to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Unfavorable economic conditions also would be expected to increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. These events could limit our investment originations, limit our ability to grow and have a material negative impact on our and our portfolio companies\u2019 operating results and the fair values of our debt and equity investments.\n\n\nThe capital markets are currently in a period of disruption and economic uncertainty. Such market conditions have materially and adversely affected debt and equity capital markets, which have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our business and operations.\n\n\nThe U.S. capital markets have experienced extreme disruption since the global outbreak of COVID-19. Such disruptions have been evidenced by volatility in global stock markets as a result of, among other things, uncertainty regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and the fluctuating price of commodities such as oil. Despite actions of the U.S. federal government and foreign governments, these events have contributed to worsening general economic conditions that are materially and adversely impacting broader financial and credit markets and reducing the availability of debt and equity capital for the market as a whole. These conditions could continue for a prolonged period of time or worsen in the future.\n \n\n\nSignificant changes or volatility in the capital markets may negatively affect, the valuations of our investments. While most of our investments are not publicly traded, applicable accounting standards require us to assume as part of our valuation process that our investments are sold in a principal market to market participants (even if we plan to hold an investment to maturity). Our valuations, and particularly valuations of private investments and private companies, are inherently uncertain, fluctuate over short periods of time and are often based on estimates, comparisons and qualitative evaluations of private information that may not reflect the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response thereto. Any public health emergency, including the COVID-19 pandemic or an outbreak of other existing or new epidemic diseases, or the threat thereof, and the resulting financial and economic market uncertainty could have a significant adverse impact on us and the fair value of our investments and our portfolio companies.\n\n\nSignificant changes in the capital markets, such as the disruption in economic activity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, have limited and could continue to limit our investment originations, limit our ability to grow and have a material negative impact on our and our portfolio companies\u2019 operating results and the fair values of our debt and equity investments. Additionally, the recent disruption in economic activity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on the potential for liquidity events involving our investments. The illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments to access capital, if required. As a result, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded our investments if we were required to sell them to increase our liquidity. An inability on our part to raise incremental capital, and any required sale of all or a portion of our investments as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\n\nFurther, current market conditions may make it difficult to raise equity capital, extend the maturity of or refinance our existing indebtedness or obtain new indebtedness with similar terms and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business. The debt capital available to us in the future, if available at all, may bear a higher interest rate and may be available only on terms and conditions less favorable than those of our existing debt and such debt may need to be incurred in a rising interest rate environment. If we are unable to raise new debt or refinance our existing debt, then our equity investors will not benefit from the potential for increased returns on equity resulting from leverage, and we may be unable to make new commitments or to fund existing commitments to our portfolio companies. Any inability to extend the maturity of or refinance our existing debt, or to obtain new debt, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n30\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nLegal and Regulatory\n\n\nOur operation as a BDC imposes numerous constraints on us and significantly reduces our operating flexibility. In addition, if we fail to maintain our status as a BDC, we might be regulated as a closed-end investment company, which would subject us to additional regulatory restrictions.\n\n\nThe Investment Company Act imposes numerous constraints on the operations of BDCs. For example, BDCs generally are required to invest at least 70% of their total assets primarily in securities of qualifying U.S. private companies or thinly traded public companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less from the time of investment. These constraints may hinder our Investment Adviser\u2019s ability to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities and to achieve our investment objective. Furthermore, any failure to comply with the requirements imposed on BDCs by the Investment Company Act could cause the SEC to bring an enforcement action against us and/or expose us to claims of private litigants.\n\n\nWe may be precluded from investing in what our Investment Adviser believes are attractive investments if such investments are not qualifying assets for purposes of the Investment Company Act. If we do not invest a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets, we will be prohibited from making any additional investment that is not a qualifying asset and could be forced to forgo attractive investment opportunities. Similarly, these rules could prevent us from making follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies (which could result in the dilution of our position).\n\n\nIf we fail to maintain our status as a BDC, we might be regulated as a closed-end investment company that is required to register under the Investment Company Act, which would subject us to additional regulatory restrictions and significantly decrease our operating flexibility. In addition, any such failure could cause an event of default under any outstanding indebtedness we might have, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\n\nWe will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on all of our income if we are unable to maintain our qualification for tax treatment as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\n\n\nAlthough we have elected to be treated, and expect to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain RIC status. To maintain RIC status and be relieved of U.S. federal income taxes on income and gains distributed to our stockholders, we must meet the annual distribution, source-of-income and asset diversification requirements described below.\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nThe annual distribution requirement for a RIC will generally be satisfied if we distribute to our stockholders on an annual basis at least 90% of our investment company taxable income (generally, our net ordinary income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction) for each taxable year. Because we use debt financing, we are subject to an asset coverage ratio requirement under the Investment Company Act, and we are subject to certain covenants contained in our credit agreements and other debt financing agreements. This asset coverage ratio requirement and these covenants could, under certain circumstances, restrict us from making distributions to our stockholders that are necessary for us to satisfy the distribution requirement. If we are unable to obtain cash from other sources, and thus are unable to make sufficient distributions to our stockholders, we could fail to maintain our RIC tax treatment and thus become subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax (and any applicable U.S. state and local taxes).\n\n\n\u2022\nThe source-of-income requirement will be satisfied if at least 90% of our gross income for each year is derived from dividends, interest, gains from the sale of stock or securities or foreign currencies, payments with respect to loans of certain securities, net income derived from an interest in a \u201cqualified publicly traded partnership\u201d or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities or foreign currencies.\n\n\n\u2022\nThe asset diversification requirement will be satisfied if, at the end of each quarter of our taxable year, at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs and other acceptable securities, and no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities (other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs) of one issuer, of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or of certain \u201cqualified publicly traded partnerships.\u201d Failure to meet these requirements may result in our having to dispose of certain investments quickly in order to prevent the loss of our RIC status. Because most of our investments will be in private companies, and therefore will be relatively illiquid, any such dispositions could be made at disadvantageous prices and could result in substantial losses.\n\n\nIf we fail to maintain our RIC status for any reason, and we do \nnot qualify for certain relief provisions under the Code, we would be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax (and any applicable U.S. state and local taxes). In this event, the resulting taxes and any resulting penalties could substantially reduce our net assets, the amount of our income available for distribution and the amount of our distributions to our stockholders, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n31\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nRegulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital. These constraints may hinder our Investment Adviser\u2019s ability to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities and to achieve our investment objective.\n\n\nRegulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to raise additional capital, and the ways in which we can do so. Raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage, and may result in dilution to our current stockholders. The Investment Company Act limits our ability to borrow amounts or issue debt securities or preferred stock, which we refer to collectively as \u201csenior securities,\u201d to amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined under the Investment Company Act, equals at least 150% immediately after such borrowing or issuance if certain requirements are met (except in connection with certain trading practices or investments), rather than 200%, as previously required and as described below. Consequently, if the value of our assets declines, we may be required to sell a portion of our investments and, depending on the nature of our leverage, repay a portion of our indebtedness at a time when this may be disadvantageous to us and, as a result, our stockholders. The Small Business Credit Availability Act modified the applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act to reduce the required asset coverage ratio applicable to BDCs to 150%, subject to certain approval and disclosure requirements. Under the legislation, BDCs are able to increase their leverage capacity if stockholders approve a proposal to do so. At our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders held on June 15, 2018, our stockholders approved the proposal to apply the modified asset coverage requirements in Section 61(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act to us.\n \n\n\nWe are generally not able to issue and sell our common stock at a price per share below NAV per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current NAV per share of our common stock (i) with the consent of a majority of our common stockholders (and a majority of our common stockholders who are not affiliates of ours) and (ii) if, among other things, a majority of our Independent Directors and a majority of our directors who have no financial interest in the transaction determine that a sale is in the best interests of us and our stockholders. If our common stock trades at a discount to NAV, this restriction could adversely affect our ability to raise capital.\n\n\nWe incur significant costs as a result of being subject to the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act.\n\n\nWe incur legal, accounting and other expenses, including costs associated with the periodic reporting requirements applicable to a company whose securities are registered under the Exchange Act, as well as additional corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and other rules implemented by the SEC. These requirements may place a strain on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, which requires significant resources and management oversight. See \u201cItem 1. Business\u2014Compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\u201d We are implementing additional procedures, processes, policies and practices for the purpose of addressing the standards and requirements applicable to public companies. These activities may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have incurred, and expect to incur in the future, significant additional annual expenses related to these steps and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, director fees, reporting requirements of the SEC, transfer agent fees, additional administrative expenses payable to our administrator to compensate it for hiring additional accounting, legal and administrative personnel, increased auditing and legal fees and similar expenses associated with being subject to these reporting requirements.\n\n\nEfforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act involve significant expenditures, and noncompliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may adversely affect us and the market price of our securities.\n\n\nWe are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. Under current SEC rules, we are required to report on internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and our independent registered public accounting firm must audit this report. We are required to review on an annual basis our internal control over financial reporting, and on a quarterly and annual basis to evaluate and disclose changes in our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n\nAs a result, we incur additional expenses that may negatively impact our financial performance and our ability to make distributions. This process also may result in a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention. We cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of any evaluation, testing and remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations, and we may not be able to ensure that the process is effective or that our internal control over financial reporting is or will be effective in a timely manner. In the event that we are unable to maintain or achieve compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related rules, we and the market price of our common stock would be adversely affected.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n32\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nChanges in laws or regulations governing our operations or the operations of our portfolio companies, changes in the interpretation thereof or newly enacted laws or regulations, or any failure by us or our portfolio companies to comply with these laws or regulations, could require changes to certain of our or our portfolio companies\u2019 business practices, negatively impact our or our portfolio companies\u2019 operations, cash flows or financial condition, impose additional costs on us or our portfolio companies or otherwise adversely affect our business or the business of our portfolio companies.\n\n\nWe and our portfolio companies are subject to regulation at the local, state, federal and, in some cases, foreign levels. These laws and regulations, as well as their interpretation, are likely to change from time to time, and new laws and regulations may be enacted. Accordingly, any change in these laws or regulations, changes in their interpretation, or newly enacted laws or regulations, or any failure by us or our portfolio companies to comply with these laws or regulations, could require changes to certain of our or our portfolio companies\u2019 business practices, negatively impact our or our portfolio companies\u2019 operations, cash flows or financial condition, impose additional costs on us or our portfolio companies or otherwise adversely affect our business or the business of our portfolio companies. In addition to the legal, tax and regulatory changes that are expected to occur, there may be unanticipated changes and uncertainty regarding any such changes. The legal, tax and regulatory environment for BDCs, investment advisers and the instruments that they utilize (including derivative instruments) is continuously evolving. In addition, there is significant uncertainty regarding certain legislation and the regulations that have been adopted (and future regulations that will need to be adopted pursuant to such legislation) and, consequently, the full impact that such legislation will ultimately have on us and the markets in which we trade and invest is not fully known. Such uncertainty and any resulting confusion may itself be detrimental to the efficient functioning of the markets and the success of certain investment strategies.\n\n\nLegislative and regulatory proposals directed at the financial services industry that are proposed or pending in the U.S. Congress, may negatively impact the operations, cash flows or financial condition of us and our portfolio companies, impose additional costs on us and our portfolio companies, intensify the regulatory supervision of us and our portfolio companies or otherwise adversely affect our business or the business of our portfolio companies.\n\n\nOver the last several years, there also has been an increase in regulatory attention to the extension of credit outside of the traditional banking sector, raising the possibility that some portion of the non-bank financial sector will be subject to new regulation. While it cannot be known at this time whether any regulation will be implemented or what form it will take, increased regulation of non-bank credit extension could negatively impact our operations, cash flows or financial condition, impose additional costs on us, intensify the regulatory supervision of us or otherwise adversely affect our business.\n\n\nWe cannot predict how new tax legislation will affect us, our investments, or our stockholders, and any such legislation could adversely affect our business.\n\n\nLegislative or other actions relating to taxes could have a negative effect on us. The rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Treasury Department. The Biden Administration has proposed significant changes to the existing U.S. tax rules, and there are a number of proposals in Congress that would similarly modify the existing U.S. tax rules. The likelihood of any such legislation being enacted is uncertain, but new legislation and any U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions interpreting such legislation could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC or the U.S. federal income tax consequences to us and our stockholders of such qualification, or could have other adverse consequences. Stockholders are urged to consult with their tax advisor regarding tax legislative, regulatory, or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our common stock.\n\n\nOur ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates is restricted.\n\n\nAs a BDC, we are prohibited under the Investment Company Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of a majority of our Independent Directors who have no financial interest in the transaction, or in some cases, the prior approval of the SEC. For example, any person that owns, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of our outstanding voting securities is deemed our affiliate for purposes of the Investment Company Act and, if this is the only reason such person is our affiliate, we are generally prohibited from buying any asset from or selling any asset (other than our capital stock) to such affiliate, absent the prior approval of such directors. The Investment Company Act also prohibits \u201cjoint\u201d transactions with an affiliate, which could include joint investments in the same portfolio company, without approval of our Independent Directors or in some cases the prior approval of the SEC. Moreover, except in certain limited circumstances, we are prohibited from buying any asset from or selling any asset to a holder of more than 25% of our voting securities, absent prior approval of the SEC. The analysis of whether a particular transaction constitutes a joint transaction requires a review of the relevant facts and circumstances then existing.\n\n\nIn certain circumstances, negotiated co-investments may be made only pursuant to an order from the SEC permitting us to do so. On January 4, 2017, the SEC granted GS PMMC and GS MMLC (which was merged with us on October 12, 2020) and us exemptive relief to co-invest with other funds managed by the GSAM Credit Alternatives investment team in a manner consistent with our investment objectives, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. Additionally, if our Investment Adviser forms other funds in the future (such as GS PMMC II and GS MMLC II), we and such other funds may co-invest on a concurrent basis with such other affiliates, subject to compliance with the exemptive relief, applicable regulations and regulatory guidance, as well as applicable allocation\n \n\n\n33\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nprocedures. As a result of our exemptive order, there could be significant overlap in our investment portfolio and the investment portfolios of GS PMMC, GS PMMC II, \nGS MMLC II\n and/or other funds managed by our Investment Adviser. The Company has applied for a new exemptive relief order which, if granted, would supersede the current exemptive order and would permit the Company greater flexibility to enter into co-investment transactions. The applied-for relief has not yet been granted and may not ultimately be granted.\n \n\n\nOur activities may be limited as a result of potentially being deemed to be controlled by a bank holding company.\n\n\nGroup Inc. is a BHC under the BHCA is and therefore subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve. In addition, Group Inc. is a FHC under the BHCA, which is a status available to BHCs that meet certain criteria. FHCs may engage in a broader range of activities than BHCs that are not FHCs. However, the activities of FHCs and their affiliates remain subject to certain restrictions imposed by the BHCA and related regulations. Because Group Inc. may be deemed to \u201ccontrol\u201d us within the meaning of the BHCA, these restrictions could apply to us as well. Accordingly, the BHCA and other applicable banking laws, rules, regulations and guidelines, and their interpretation and administration by the appropriate regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve, may restrict our investments, transactions and operations and may restrict the transactions and relationships between our Investment Adviser, Group Inc. and their affiliates, on the one hand, and us on the other hand. For example, the BHCA regulations applicable to Group Inc. and us may, among other things, restrict our ability to make certain investments or the size of certain investments, impose a maximum holding period on some or all of our investments and restrict our and our Investment Adviser\u2019s ability to participate in the management and operations of the companies in which we invest. In addition, certain BHCA regulations may require aggregation of the positions owned, held or controlled by related entities. Thus, in certain circumstances, positions held by Group Inc. and its affiliates (including our Investment Adviser) for client and proprietary accounts may need to be aggregated with positions held by us. In this case, where BHCA regulations impose a cap on the amount of a position that may be held, Group Inc. may utilize available capacity to make investments for its proprietary accounts or for the accounts of other clients, which may require us to limit and/or liquidate certain investments.\n\n\nThese restrictions may materially adversely affect us by, among other things, affecting our Investment Adviser\u2019s ability to pursue certain strategies within our investment program or trade in certain securities. In addition, Group Inc. may cease in the future to qualify as an FHC, which may subject us to additional restrictions. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the bank regulatory requirements applicable to Group Inc. and us, or the interpretation thereof, will not change, or that any such change will not have a material adverse effect on us.\n\n\nGroup Inc. may in the future, in its sole discretion and without notice to investors, engage in activities impacting us and/or our Investment Adviser in order to comply with the BHCA or other legal requirements applicable to, or reduce or eliminate the impact or applicability of any bank regulations or other restrictions on, Group Inc., us or other funds and accounts managed by our Investment Adviser and its affiliates. Group Inc. may seek to accomplish this result by causing GSAM to resign as our Investment Adviser, voting for changes to our Board of Directors, causing Goldman Sachs personnel to resign from our Board of Directors, reducing the amount of Group Inc.\u2019s investment in us (if any), revoking our right to use the Goldman Sachs name or any combination of the foregoing, or by such other means as it determines in its sole discretion. Any replacement investment adviser appointed by us may be unaffiliated with Goldman Sachs.\n\n\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission rules may have a negative impact on us and our Investment Adviser.\n\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d) and the SEC have issued final rules establishing that certain swap transactions are subject to CFTC regulation. Engaging in such swap or other commodity interest transactions such as futures contracts or options on futures contracts may cause us to fall within the definition of \u201ccommodity pool\u201d under the Commodity Exchange Act and related CFTC regulations. Our Investment Adviser has claimed relief from CFTC registration and regulation as a commodity pool operator pursuant to CFTC Rule 4.5 with respect to our operations, with the result that we will be limited in our ability to use futures contracts or options on futures contracts or engage in swap transactions. Specifically, CFTC Rule 4.5 imposes strict limitations on using such derivatives other than for hedging purposes, whereby the use of derivatives not used solely for hedging purposes is generally limited to situations where (i) the aggregate initial margin and premiums required to establish such positions does not exceed five percent of the liquidation value of our portfolio, after taking into account unrealized profits and unrealized losses on any such contracts it has entered into; or (ii) the aggregate net notional value of such derivatives does not exceed 100% of the liquidation value of our portfolio. Moreover, we anticipate entering into transactions involving such derivatives to a very limited extent solely for hedging purposes or otherwise within the limitations of CFTC Rule 4.5.\n\n\nOur ability to enter into transactions involving derivatives and financial commitment transactions may be limited.\n\n\nIn November 2020, the SEC adopted a rulemaking regarding the ability of a BDC (or a registered investment company) to use derivatives and other transactions that create future payment or delivery obligations (except reverse repurchase agreements and similar financing transactions). Under the newly adopted rules, BDCs that use derivatives will be subject to a value-at-risk (\u201cVaR\u201d) leverage limit, a derivatives risk management program and testing requirements and requirements related to board reporting. These new requirements will apply unless the BDC qualifies as a \u201climited derivatives user,\u201d as defined under the adopted rules. Under the new rule, a BDC may enter into an unfunded commitment agreement that is not a derivatives transaction, such as an agreement to provide financing to a portfolio company, if the BDC has, among other things, a reasonable belief, at the time it enters into such an agreement, that it will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet its obligations with respect to all of its unfunded commitment agreements, in each case as it becomes due. Collectively, these requirements may limit our ability to use derivatives and/or enter into certain other financial contracts.\n\n\n34\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nCertain investors are limited in their ability to make significant investments in us.\n\n\nPrivate funds that are excluded from the definition of \u201cinvestment company\u201d either pursuant to Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act are restricted from acquiring directly or through a controlled entity more than 3% of our total outstanding voting stock (measured at the time of the acquisition, including through conversion of convertible securities). Investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act and BDCs are also subject to this restriction as well as other limitations under the Investment Company Act that would restrict the amount that they are able to invest in our securities. As a result, certain investors may be precluded from acquiring additional shares, at a time that they might desire to do so.\n\n\nCompetition\n\n\nWe are dependent upon management personnel of our Investment Adviser for our future success.\n\n\nWe do not have any employees. We depend on the experience, diligence, skill and network of business contacts of the GSAM Credit Alternatives Team, together with other investment professionals that our Investment Adviser currently retains or may subsequently retain, to identify, evaluate, negotiate, structure, close, monitor and manage our Investments. Our future success will depend to a significant extent on the continued service and coordination of our Investment Adviser\u2019s senior investment professionals. The departure of any of our Investment Adviser\u2019s key personnel, including members of the BDC Investment Committee, or of a significant number of the investment professionals of our Investment Adviser, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we cannot assure stockholders that our Investment Adviser will remain our investment adviser or that we will continue to have access to our Investment Adviser or its investment professionals. See \u201c\u2014\nOur Business and Structure\n\u2014Our Investment Adviser can resign on 60 days\u2019 notice. We may not be able to find a suitable replacement within that time, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations.\u201d\n\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities.\n\n\nA number of entities, including GS PMMC, GS PMMC II and GS MMLC II, compete with us to make the types of investments that we make in middle-market companies. We compete with other BDCs, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies, collateralized loan obligations (\"CLOs\"), private funds, including hedge funds, and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity funds. Many of our competitors are more experienced, substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. Some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, certain of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the Investment Company Act imposes on us as a BDC and that the Code imposes on us as a RIC. Additionally, an investment opportunity may be appropriate for one or more of us and GS PMMC, GS PMMC II \nand GS MMLC II\n or any other investment fund managed by our affiliates and co-investment may not be possible. In these instances GSAM will adhere to its investment allocation policy in order to determine to which entity to allocate the opportunity. Also, as a result of this competition, we may not be able to secure attractive investment opportunities from time to time.\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nWe do not seek to compete primarily based on the interest rates we offer and GSAM believes that some of our competitors may make loans with interest rates that are comparable to or lower than the rates we offer. Rather, we compete with our competitors based on our reputation in the market, our existing investment platform, the seasoned investment professionals of our Investment Adviser, our experience and focus on middle-market companies, our disciplined investment philosophy, our extensive industry focus and relationships and our flexible transaction structuring. For a more detailed discussion of these competitive advantages, see \u201cItem 1. Business\u2014Competitive Advantages.\u201d\n\n\nWe may lose investment opportunities if we do not match our competitors\u2019 pricing, terms and structure. If we match our competitors\u2019 pricing, terms and structure, we may experience decreased net interest income and increased risk of credit loss. As a result of operating in such a competitive environment, we may make investments that are on less favorable terms than what we may have originally anticipated, which may impact our return on these investments. We cannot assure investors that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\nOperational\n\n\nWe are dependent on information systems, and systems failures, as well as operating failures, could significantly disrupt our business, which may, in turn, negatively affect our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.\n\n\nOur business is dependent on our Investment Adviser\u2019s and third parties\u2019 communications and information systems. Any failure or interruption of those systems, including as a result of the termination of the Investment Management Agreement or an agreement with any third-party service providers, could cause delays or other problems in our activities. Our financial, accounting, data processing, backup or other operating\n \n\n\n35\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nsystems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control and adversely affect our business. There could be:\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nsudden electrical or telecommunications outages;\n\n\n\u2022\nnatural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes;\n\n\n\u2022\ndisease pandemics;\n\n\n\u2022\nevents arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and\n\n\n\u2022\ncyber-attacks.\n\n\nIn addition to our dependence on information systems, poor operating performance by our service providers could adversely impact us.\n\n\nThese events, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and negatively affect the market price of our securities and our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders.\n\n\nTerrorist attacks, acts of war, global health emergencies or natural disasters may impact the businesses in which we invest and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\n\nTerrorist acts, acts of war, global health emergencies or natural disasters may disrupt our operations, as well as the operations of the businesses in which we invest. Such acts have created, and continue to create, economic and political uncertainties and have contributed to global economic instability. Future terrorist activities, military or security operations, global health emergencies or natural disasters could further weaken the domestic/global economies and create additional uncertainties, which may negatively impact the businesses in which we invest directly or indirectly and, in turn, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Losses from terrorist attacks, global health emergencies and natural disasters are generally uninsurable.\n\n\nCybersecurity risks and cyber incidents may adversely affect our business or the business of our portfolio companies by causing a disruption to our operations or the operations of our portfolio companies, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information or the confidential information of our portfolio companies and/or damage to our business relationships or the business relationships of our portfolio companies, all of which could negatively impact the business, financial condition and operating results of us or our portfolio companies.\n\n\nA cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the information resources of us or our portfolio companies. These incidents may be an intentional attack or an unintentional event and could involve a third party or our own personnel gaining unauthorized access to our information systems or those of our portfolio companies for purposes of obtaining ransom payments, misappropriating assets, stealing confidential information, corrupting data or causing operational disruption. The result of these incidents may include disrupted operations, misstated or unreliable financial data, liability for loss or misappropriation of data, stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection and insurance costs, litigation and damage to our reputation or business relationships. As our and our portfolio companies\u2019 reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our information systems, both internal and those provided by Goldman Sachs and third-party service providers, and the information systems of our portfolio companies. Goldman Sachs and these third-party service providers have implemented processes, procedures and internal controls to help mitigate cybersecurity risks and cyber intrusions, but these measures, as well as our increased awareness of the nature and extent of a risk of a cyber incident, do not guarantee that a cyber incident will not occur and/or that our financial results, operations or confidential information will not be negatively impacted by such an incident.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n36\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nOur Business and Structure\n\n\nGlobal economic, political and market conditions may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our revenue growth and profitability.\n\n\nThe current worldwide financial market situation, as well as various social and political tensions in the United States and around the world, have contributed and may continue to contribute to increased market volatility, may have long-term effects on the United States and worldwide financial markets, and may cause economic uncertainties or deterioration in the United States and worldwide. We monitor developments and seek to manage our investments in a manner consistent with achieving our investment objective, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so.\n\n\nOur business is directly influenced by the economic cycle, and could be negatively impacted by a downturn in economic activity in the U.S. as well as globally. Fiscal and monetary actions taken by U.S. and non-U.S. government and regulatory authorities could have a material adverse impact on our business. To the extent uncertainty regarding the U.S. or global economy negatively impacts consumer confidence and consumer credit factors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Moreover, Federal Reserve policy, including with respect to certain interest rates, along with the general policies of the current Presidential administration, may also adversely affect the value, volatility and liquidity of dividend- and interest-paying securities. These conditions, government actions and future developments may cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise, which may adversely affect our ability to access debt financing on favorable terms and may increase the interest costs of our borrowers, hampering their ability to repay us. Continued or future adverse economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\nIf key economic indicators, such as the unemployment rate or inflation, do not progress at a rate consistent with the Federal Reserve\u2019s objectives, the target range for the federal funds rate may increase and cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise, which may negatively impact our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms and may also increase the costs of our borrowers, hampering their ability to repay us. The Federal Reserve recently indicated that, in light of the economic recovery and higher than anticipated inflation, it expects to raise interest rates as early as March 2022. However the timing, number and amount of any such future interest rate increases are uncertain.\n\n\nLegislation may be adopted that could significantly affect the regulation of U.S. financial markets. Areas subject to potential change, amendment or repeal include the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) and the authority of the Federal Reserve and the Financial Stability Oversight Council. These or other regulatory changes could result in greater competition from banks and other lenders with which we compete for lending and other investment opportunities. The United States may also potentially withdraw from or renegotiate various trade agreements and take other actions that would change current trade policies of the United States. We cannot predict which, if any, of these actions will be taken or, if taken, their effect on the financial stability of the United States. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\nOur Investment Adviser, its principals, investment professionals and employees and the members of its BDC Investment Committee have certain conflicts of interest.\n\n\nOur Investment Adviser, its principals, affiliates, investment professionals and employees, the members of its BDC Investment Committee and our officers and directors serve or may serve now or in the future as investment advisers, officers, directors, principals of, or in other capacities with respect to, public or private entities (including other BDCs and other investment funds) that operate in the same or a related line of business as us. For example, we have the same management and BDC Investment Committee team as GS PMMC, GS PMMC II \nand GS MMLC II\n. Therefore, we expect these individuals may have obligations to investors in such other BDCs, the fulfillment of which might not be in our best interests or the best interests of our stockholders and we expect that investment opportunities will satisfy the investment criteria for both us and such other BDCs. In addition, GSAM and its affiliates also manage other Accounts, and expect to manage other vehicles in the future, that have investment mandates that are similar, in whole or in part, to ours and, accordingly, may invest in asset classes similar to those targeted by us. As a result, the Investment Adviser and/or its affiliates may face conflicts in allocating investment opportunities between us and such other entities. The fact that our investment advisory fees may be lower than those of certain other funds advised by GSAM could result in this conflict of interest affecting us adversely relative to such other funds.\n\n\nSubject to applicable law, we may invest alongside Goldman Sachs and its Accounts. In certain circumstances, negotiated co-investments by us and other Accounts may be made only pursuant to an order from the SEC permitting us to do so. On January 4, 2017, the SEC granted GS PMMC and GS MMLC (which was merged with us on October 12, 2020) and us exemptive relief to co-invest with other funds managed by the GSAM Credit Alternatives investment team in a manner consistent with our investment objectives, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. Additionally, if our Investment Adviser forms other funds in the future (such as GS PMMC II and GS MMLC II), we and such other funds may co-invest on a concurrent basis with such other affiliates, subject to compliance with the exemptive relief, applicable regulations and regulatory guidance, as well as applicable allocation procedures. Under the terms of our exemptive relief, a \u201crequired majority\u201d (as defined in Section 57(o) of the Investment Company Act) of our Independent Directors must make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair to us and our Stockholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our Stockholders on the part of any person concerned,\n \n\n\n37\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nand (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our Stockholders and is consistent with our Board of Directors approved criteria. See \u201c\u2014Legal and Regulatory\u2014Our ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates is restricted.\u201d\n\n\nAs a result of such order, there could be significant overlap in our investment portfolio and the investment portfolios of GS PMMC, GS PMMC II, \nGS MMLC II\n and/or other funds managed by our Investment Adviser. If we are unable to rely on our exemptive relief for a particular opportunity, when our Investment Adviser identifies certain investments, it will be required to determine which Accounts should make the investment at the potential exclusion of other Accounts. In such circumstances, the Investment Adviser will adhere to its investment allocation policy in order to determine the Account to which to allocate the opportunity. The policy currently provides that our Investment Adviser allocate opportunities through a rotation system or in such other manner as our Investment Adviser determines to be equitable. Accordingly, it is possible that we may not be given the opportunity to participate in investments made by other Accounts. See \u201c\u2014Legal and Regulatory\u2014Our ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates is restricted.\u201d In addition, the Company has applied for a new exemptive relief order which, if granted, would supersede the current exemptive order and would permit the Company greater flexibility to enter into co-investment transactions. The applied-for relief has not yet been granted and may not ultimately be granted.\n\n\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 financial and other interests may incentivize Goldman Sachs to favor other Accounts.\n\n\nOur Investment Adviser receives performance-based compensation in respect of its investment management activities on our behalf, which rewards our Investment Adviser for positive performance of our investment portfolio. As a result, our Investment Adviser may make investments for us that present a greater potential for return but also a greater risk of loss or that are more speculative than would be the case in the absence of performance-based compensation. In addition, our Investment Adviser may simultaneously manage other Accounts (including GS PMMC, GS PMMC II \nand GS MMLC II or other BDCs\n) for which our Investment Adviser may be entitled to receive greater fees or other compensation (as a percentage of performance or otherwise) than it receives in respect of us. In addition, subject to applicable law, Goldman Sachs may invest in other Accounts (including GS PMMC, GS PMMC II \nand GS MMLC II or other BDCs\n), and such investments may constitute substantial percentages of such other Accounts\u2019 outstanding equity interests. Therefore, our Investment Adviser may have an incentive to favor such other Accounts over us. To address these types of conflicts, our Investment Adviser has adopted policies and procedures under which investment opportunities will be allocated in a manner that it believes is consistent with its obligations as an Investment Adviser. However, the amount, timing, structuring or terms of an investment by us may differ from, and performance may be different than, the investments and performance of other Accounts.\n\n\nOur financial condition and results of operations depend on our Investment Adviser\u2019s ability to manage our future growth effectively.\n\n\nOur ability to achieve our investment objective depends on our Investment Adviser\u2019s ability to identify, invest in and monitor companies that meet our investment criteria. Accomplishing this result on a cost-effective basis is largely a function of the structuring of our investment process and the ability of our Investment Adviser to provide competent, attentive and efficient services to us. Our executive officers and the members of the BDC Investment Committee have substantial responsibilities in connection with their roles at our Investment Adviser, with respect to GS PMMC, GS PMMC II \nand GS MMLC II\n, and other clients of our Investment Adviser, as well as responsibilities under the Investment Management Agreement. We may also be called upon to provide significant managerial assistance to certain of our portfolio companies. These demands on their time, which will increase as the number of investments grow, may distract them or slow the rate of investment. In order to grow, our Investment Adviser may need to hire, train, supervise, manage and retain new employees. However, we cannot assure you that they will be able to do so effectively. Any failure to manage our future growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\nOur ability to grow depends on our ability to raise additional capital.\n\n\nWe will need to periodically access the capital markets to raise cash to fund new investments. If we do not have adequate capital available for investment, our performance could be adversely affected. In addition, we have elected to be treated, and expect to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2013. To maintain our status as a RIC, among other requirements, we are required to timely distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our investment company taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction), which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses, if any, for each taxable year. Consequently, such distributions will not be available to fund new investments. We expect to use debt financing and issue additional securities to fund our growth, if any. Unfavorable economic or capital market conditions may increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. An inability to successfully access the capital markets could limit our ability to grow our business and fully execute our business strategy and could decrease our earnings, if any. We may pursue growth through acquisitions or strategic investments in new businesses. Completion and timing of any such acquisitions or strategic investments may be subject to a number of contingencies and risks. There can be no assurance that the integration of an acquired business will be successful or that an acquired business will prove to be profitable or sustainable.\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nWe borrow money, which may magnify the potential for gain or loss and may increase the risk of investing in us.\n\n\nAs part of our business strategy, we may borrow from and issue senior debt securities to banks, insurance companies and other lenders or investors. Holders of these senior securities will have fixed-dollar claims on our assets that are superior to the claims of our common\n \n\n\n38\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nstockholders. If the value of our assets decreases, leveraging would cause NAV to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have if we did not employ leverage. Similarly, any decrease in our income would cause net income to decline more sharply than it would have had we not borrowed. Such a decline could negatively affect our ability to make distributions to our common stockholders. In addition, we would have to service any additional debt that we incur, including interest expense on debt and dividends on preferred stock that we may issue, as well as the fees and costs related to the entry into or amendments to debt facilities. These expenses (which may be higher than the expenses on our current borrowings due to the rising interest rate environment) would decrease net investment income, and our ability to pay such expenses will depend largely on our financial performance and will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and competitive pressures. Moreover, leverage will increase the Management Fee payable to our Investment Adviser, which is based on our gross assets, including those assets acquired through the use of leverage but excluding cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, we will be able to incur additional leverage if we are able to obtain exemptive relief from the SEC to exclude the debt of any SBIC subsidiary we may form in the future from the leverage requirements otherwise applicable to BDCs. We have not yet applied to the Small Business Administration (the \u201cSBA\u201d) for approval to form a SBIC and have not yet applied for exemptive relief from the SEC. We can offer no assurances as to whether or when we will be able to form a SBIC subsidiary or obtain such exemptive relief.\n\n\nIn addition to having fixed-dollar claims on our assets that are superior to the claims of our common stockholders, any obligations to the lenders will be secured by a first priority security interest in our portfolio of investments and cash. In the case of a liquidation event, those lenders would receive proceeds to the extent of their security interest before any distributions are made to our stockholders. Furthermore, our senior secured revolving credit agreement with Truist Bank (formerly known as SunTrust Bank), as administrative agent, and Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent (as amended, the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d) imposes, and any credit agreement or other debt financing agreement into which we may enter may impose, financial and operating covenants that restrict our investment activities (including restrictions on industry concentrations), remedies on default and similar matters. In connection with borrowings, our lenders may also require us to pledge assets.\n\n\nLastly, we may be unable to obtain our desired leverage, which would, in turn, affect your return on investment.\n\n\nThe following table illustrates the effect of leverage on returns from an investment in our common stock assuming various annual returns on our portfolio, net of expenses. The calculations in the table below are hypothetical, and actual returns may be higher or lower than those appearing in the table below.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssumed Return on Our Portfolio (Net of Expenses)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(10.00\n\n\n)%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(5.00\n\n\n)%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.00\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5.00\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n10.00\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorresponding Return to Common Stockholder \n(1)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(25.44\n\n\n)%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(14.40\n\n\n)%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(3.37\n\n\n)%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n7.67\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n18.71\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\n\n\nBased on (i) $3,563.29 million in total assets including debt issuance costs as of December 31, 2021, (ii) $1,873.72 million in outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2021, (iii) $1,614.40 million in net assets as of December 31, 2021 and (iv) an annualized average interest rate on our indebtedness, as of December 31, 2021, excluding fees (such as fees on undrawn amounts and amortization of financing costs), of 2.90%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Investment Adviser will be paid the Management Fee even if the value of your investment declines and our Investment Adviser\u2019s Incentive Fee may create incentives for it to make certain kinds of investments.\n\n\nThe Management Fee is payable even in the event the value of your investment declines. The Management Fee is calculated as a percentage of the average value of our gross assets including borrowed funds (excluding cash or cash equivalents) at the end of the prior two completed calendar quarters. Accordingly, the Management Fee is payable regardless of whether the value of our gross assets and/or your investment has decreased during the then-current quarter and creates an incentive for the Investment Adviser to incur leverage.\n\n\nIn addition, the Incentive Fee payable by us to our Investment Adviser may create an incentive for our Investment Adviser to make investments on our behalf that are risky or more speculative than would be the case in the absence of such a compensation arrangement and also to incur leverage, which will tend to enhance returns where our portfolio has positive returns. Our Investment Adviser receives the Incentive Fee based, in part, upon capital gains realized on our investments. As a result, our Investment Adviser may have an incentive to invest more in companies whose securities are likely to yield capital gains, as compared to income-producing securities. Such a practice could result in our investing in more speculative securities than would otherwise be the case, which could result in higher investment losses, particularly during cyclical economic downturns.\n\n\nThe Incentive Fee payable by us to our Investment Adviser also may create an incentive for our Investment Adviser to invest on our behalf in instruments that have a deferred interest feature. Under these investments, we accrue the interest over the life of the investment but do not receive the cash income from the investment until the end of the term. Our net investment income used to calculate the income portion of our Incentive Fee, however, includes accrued interest. Thus, a portion of this Incentive Fee is based on income that we have not yet received in cash. This risk could be increased because our Investment Adviser is not obligated to reimburse us for any Incentive Fees received even if we subsequently incur losses or never receive in cash the accrued income (including accrued income with respect to original issue discount (\u201cOID\u201d), payment-in-kind (\u201cPIK\u201d) interest and zero coupon securities).\n\n\nIf we increase leverage, the management fees payable to our Investment Adviser will be higher than if we did not use leverage, irrespective of the return on the incremental assets. In addition, as leverage generally would magnify positive returns, if any, on our portfolio, as noted above,\n \n\n\n39\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nthe use of leverage may cause our net investment income to exceed the quarterly hurdle rate for the Incentive Fee on income payable to our Investment Adviser at a lower average return on our portfolio.\n\n\nThe Incentive Fee based on income takes into account our past performance.\n\n\nThe Incentive Fee based on income will be determined and paid quarterly in arrears at the end of each calendar quarter by reference to our aggregate net investment income, as adjusted, from the Trailing Twelve Quarters. The effect of calculating the Incentive Fee using reference to the Trailing Twelve Quarters is that, in certain limited circumstances, an Incentive Fee based on income will be payable to our Investment Adviser although our net income for such quarter did not exceed the hurdle rate or the Incentive Fee will be higher than it would have been if calculated based on our performance for the applicable quarter without taking into account the Trailing Twelve Quarters. For example, if we experience a net loss for any particular quarter, an Incentive Fee may still be paid to our Investment Adviser if such net loss is less than the net loss for the most recent quarter that preceded the Trailing Twelve Quarters. In such circumstances, our Investment Adviser would be entitled to an Incentive Fee whereas it would not have been entitled to an Incentive Fee if calculated solely on the basis of our performance for the applicable quarter.\n\n\nPotential conflicts of interest with other businesses of Goldman Sachs could impact our investment returns.\n\n\nThere are significant potential conflicts of interest that could negatively impact our investment returns. A number of these potential conflicts of interest with affiliates of our Investment Adviser and Group Inc. are discussed in more detail elsewhere in this report.\n\n\nGroup Inc., including its affiliates and personnel, is a BHC and a worldwide, full-service investment banking, broker-dealer, asset management and financial services organization, and a major participant in global financial markets that provides a wide range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and high-net-worth individuals. As such, it acts as an investor, investment banker, research provider, investment manager, financier, adviser, market maker, trader, prime broker, derivatives dealer, lender, counterparty, agent and principal. In those and other capacities, Goldman Sachs and its affiliates advise clients in all markets and transactions and purchase, sell, hold and recommend a broad array of investments, including securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps, indices, baskets and other financial instruments and products for its own accounts or for the accounts of their customers, and have other direct and indirect interests, in the global fixed income, currency, commodity, equity, bank loans and other markets in which we invest or may invest. Such additional businesses and interests will likely give rise to potential conflicts of interest and may restrict the way we operate our business. For example, (1) we may not be able to conduct transactions relating to investments in portfolio companies because our Investment Adviser is not permitted to obtain or use material nonpublic information in effecting purchases and sales in public securities transactions for us or (2) Goldman Sachs, the clients it advises, and its personnel may engage (or consider engaging) in commercial arrangements or transactions with us (subject to any limitations under the law), and/or may compete for commercial arrangements or transactions in the same types of companies, assets, securities or other assets or instruments as us. Transactions by, advice to and activities of such accounts (including potentially Goldman Sachs acting on a proprietary basis), may involve the same or related companies, securities or other assets or instruments as those in which we invest and may negatively affect us (including our ability to engage in a transaction or other activities) or the prices or terms at which our transactions or other activities may be effected. For example, Goldman Sachs may be engaged to provide advice to an account that is considering entering into a transaction with us, and Goldman Sachs may advise the account not to pursue the transaction with us, or otherwise in connection with a potential transaction provide advice to the account that would be adverse to us. See \u201c\n\u2014\nOur Investment Adviser, its principals, investment professionals and employees and the members of its BDC Investment Committee have certain conflicts of interest\u201d and \u201c\n\u2014\nLegal and Regulatory\n\u2014\nOur ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates is restricted.\u201d In addition, GS & Co. may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, including the limitations set forth in Section 57(k) of the Investment Company Act, receive compensation from us or from the borrowers if we make any investments based on opportunities that such employees or personnel of GS & Co. have referred to us. Such compensation might incentivize GS & Co. or its employees or personnel to refer opportunities or to recommend investments that might otherwise be unsuitable for us. Further, any such compensation paid by us, or paid by the borrower (to which we would otherwise have been entitled) in connection with such investments, may negatively impact our returns. Furthermore, Goldman Sachs is currently, and in the future expects to be, raising capital for new public and private investment vehicles that have, or when formed will have, the primary purpose of middle-market direct lending. These investment vehicles, as well as existing investment vehicles (including GS PMMC, GS PMMC II and GS MMLC II), will compete with us for investments. Although our Investment Adviser and its affiliates will endeavor to allocate investment opportunities among their clients, including us, in a fair and equitable manner and consistent with applicable allocation procedures, it is expected that, in the future, we may not be given the opportunity to participate in investments made by other Accounts or that we may participate in such investments to a lesser extent due to participation by such other Accounts.\n\n\nIn addition, Goldman Sachs or another investment account or vehicle managed or controlled by Goldman Sachs may hold securities, loans or other instruments of a portfolio company in a different class or a different part of the capital structure than securities, loans or other instruments of such portfolio company held by us. As a result, Goldman Sachs or such other investment account or vehicle may pursue or enforce rights or activities, or refrain from pursuing or enforcing rights or activities, on behalf of its own account, that could have an adverse effect on us. In addition, to the extent Goldman Sachs has invested in a portfolio company for its own account, Goldman Sachs may limit the transactions engaged in by us with respect to such portfolio company or issuer for reputational, legal, regulatory or other reasons.\n\n\n40\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nStockholders should note the matters discussed in \u201c\u2014Legal and Regulatory\u2014Our ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates is restricted.\u201d\n\n\nGoldman Sachs has influence, and may continue to exert influence, over our management and affairs and over most votes requiring stockholder approval.\n\n\nGroup Inc. has owned a significant portion of our common stock since the inception of our operations. As of December 31, 2021, Group Inc. owned 6.37% of our outstanding common stock. GS & Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of Group Inc., has acquired shares of our common stock pursuant to a 10b5-1 plan, and may in the future acquire additional shares of our common stock in the open market, but GS & Co. will limit its collective ownership with Group Inc. to below 25.0% of our outstanding common stock. Therefore, Group Inc. is able to exert, and may be able to continue to exert, influence over our management and policies and have significant voting influence on most votes requiring stockholder approval. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of us, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of us and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock. Our Investment Adviser has the authority to vote securities held by Group Inc., including on matters that may present a conflict of interest between our Investment Adviser and other stockholders.\n\n\nOur Board of Directors may change our investment objective, operating policies and strategies without prior notice or stockholder approval.\n\n\nOur Board of Directors has the authority to modify or waive certain of our operating policies and strategies without prior notice (except as required by the Investment Company Act or other applicable laws) and without stockholder approval. However, absent stockholder approval, we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC. We cannot predict the effect any changes to our current operating policies and strategies would have on our business, operating results and market price of our securities. Nevertheless, the effects may adversely affect our business and impact our ability to make distributions or make payments with respect to our indebtedness.\n\n\nOur Investment Adviser can resign on 60 days\u2019 notice. We may not be able to find a suitable replacement within that time, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations.\n\n\nOur Investment Adviser has the right, under the Investment Management Agreement, to resign at any time upon 60 days\u2019 written notice, regardless of whether we have found a replacement. If our Investment Adviser resigns, we may not be able to find a new external investment adviser or hire internal management with similar expertise and ability to provide the same or equivalent services on acceptable terms within 60 days, or at all. If we are unable to do so quickly, our operations are likely to experience a disruption, our financial condition, business and results of operations as well as our ability to pay distributions are likely to be adversely affected, and the market price of our securities may decline.\n\n\nOur Investment Adviser\u2019s responsibilities and its liability to us are limited under the Investment Management Agreement, which may lead our Investment Adviser to act in a riskier manner on our behalf than it would when acting for its own account.\n\n\nOur Investment Adviser has not assumed any responsibility to us other than to render the services described in the Investment Management Agreement, and it will not be responsible for any action of our Board of Directors in declining to follow our Investment Adviser\u2019s advice or recommendations. Pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement, our Investment Adviser and its directors, members, stockholders, partners, officers, employees or controlling persons will not be liable to us for its acts under the Investment Management Agreement, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of its reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under the Investment Management Agreement. These protections may lead our Investment Adviser to act in a riskier manner when acting on our behalf than it would when acting for its own account. See \u201c\n\u2014\nOur Investment Adviser will be paid the Management Fee even if the value of your investment declines and our Investment Adviser\u2019s Incentive Fee may create incentives for it to make certain kinds of investments.\u201d\n\n\nWe may experience fluctuations in our quarterly results.\n\n\nWe could experience fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to a number of factors, including interest rates payable on debt investments we make, default rates on such investments, the level of our expenses, variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses, the degree to which we encounter competition in certain markets and general economic conditions. As a result of these factors, results for any period should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future periods or the full fiscal year.\n\n\nWe are exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates.\n\n\nDebt Investments that we make may be based on floating rates, such as LIBOR, the Euro Interbank Offered Rate, the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate. General interest rate fluctuations may have a substantial negative impact on our Investments, the value of our securities and our rate of return on invested capital. It is unclear how increased regulatory oversight and the future of LIBOR may affect market liquidity and the value of the financial obligations to be held by or issued to us that are linked to LIBOR, or how such changes could affect our investments and transactions and financial condition or results of operations. Central banks and regulators in a number of major jurisdictions (for example, the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, Switzerland and Japan) have convened working groups to find, and implement the transition to, suitable replacements for interbank offered rates (\u201cIBORs\u201d). On March 5 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) and\n \n\n\n41\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nICE Benchmark Authority announced that the publication of all EUR and CHF LIBOR settings, the Spot Next/Overnight, 1 week, 2 month and 12 month JPY and GBP LIBOR settings, and the 1 week and 2 months US dollar LIBOR settings would cease after December 31, 2021, while the publication of the overnight, 1 month, 3 month, 6 month, and 12 months USD LIBOR settings will cease after June 30, 2023. To identify a successor rate for U.S. dollar LIBOR, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d), a U.S.-based group convened by the Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, was formed. The ARRC has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by the U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. On December 6, 2021, the ARRC released a statement selecting and recommending forms of SOFR, along with associated spread adjustments and conforming changes, to replace references to 1-week and 2-month U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR. We expect that a substantial portion of our future floating rate Investments will be linked to SOFR. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of the transition to SOFR. In addition, we may need to renegotiate any credit agreements extending beyond June 2023 with our Portfolio Companies that utilize LIBOR terms as a factor in determining the interest rate, in order to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established, which may have an adverse effect on our overall financial condition or results of operations. As such, some or all of these credit agreements may bear a lower interest rate, which would adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations. Our Revolving Credit Facility provides by its terms for the transition to a SOFR-based rate of interest. Upon this transition, amounts drawn under our Revolving Credit Facility may bear interest at a higher rate than they would if LIBOR had continued to be used, which would increase the cost of our borrowings and, in turn, affect our results of operations.\n\n\nBecause we have borrowed money, and may issue preferred stock to finance investments, our net investment income depends, in part, upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds or pay distributions on preferred stock and the rate that our investments yield. As a result, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income.\n\n\nA reduction in the interest rates on new investments relative to interest rates on current investments could also have an adverse impact on our net interest income. However, an increase in interest rates could decrease the value of any investments we hold which earn fixed interest rates, including subordinated loans, senior and junior secured and unsecured debt securities and loans and high yield bonds, and also could increase our interest expense, thereby decreasing our net income. Also, an increase in interest rates available to investors could make an investment in our common stock less attractive if we are not able to increase our dividend rate, which could reduce the value of our common stock. Further, rising interest rates could also adversely affect our performance if such increases cause our borrowing costs to rise at a rate in excess of the rate that our investments yield.\n\n\nIn periods of rising interest rates, to the extent we borrow money subject to a floating interest rate, our cost of funds would increase, which could reduce our net investment income. Further, rising interest rates could also adversely affect our performance if such increases cause our borrowing costs to rise at a rate in excess of the rate that our investments yield. Further, rising interest rates could also adversely affect our performance if we hold investments with floating interest rates, subject to specified minimum interest rates (such as a LIBOR floor), while at the same time engaging in borrowings subject to floating interest rates not subject to such minimums. In such a scenario, rising interest rates may increase our interest expense, even though our interest income from investments is not increasing in a corresponding manner as a result of such minimum interest rates.\n\n\nIf general interest rates rise, there is a risk that the portfolio companies in which we hold floating rate securities will be unable to pay escalating interest amounts, which could result in a default under their loan documents with us. Rising interest rates could also cause portfolio companies to shift cash from other productive uses to the payment of interest, which may have a material adverse effect on their business and operations and could, over time, lead to increased defaults. In addition, rising interest rates may increase pressure on us to provide fixed rate loans to our portfolio companies, which could adversely affect our net investment income, as increases in our cost of borrowed funds would not be accompanied by increased interest income from such fixed-rate investments.\n\n\nA change in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to a change in the interest rate we receive on many of our debt investments. Accordingly, a change in the interest rate could make it easier for us to meet or exceed the performance threshold in the Investment Management Agreement and may result in a substantial increase in the amount of incentive fees payable to our Investment Adviser with respect to the portion of the Incentive Fee based on income.\n\n\nInterest rates in the United States are currently at historically low levels. Certain countries have experienced negative interest rates on certain fixed-income instruments. Changing interest rates, including rates that fall below zero, may have unpredictable effects on markets, may result in heightened market volatility and may detract from our performance to the extent we are exposed to such interest rates and/or volatility. The Federal Reserve recently indicated that, in light of the economic recovery and higher than anticipated inflation, it expects to raise interest rates as early as March 2022. However the timing, number and amount of any such future interest rate increases are uncertain.\n\n\nWe are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility.\n\n\nOur business faces increasing public scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) activities, which are increasingly considered to contribute to the long-term sustainability of a company\u2019s performance. A variety of organizations measure the performance of companies on ESG topics, and the results of these assessments are widely publicized. In addition, investment in funds that specialize in companies that perform well in such assessments are increasingly popular, and major institutional investors have publicly emphasized the importance of such ESG measures to their investment decisions.\n\n\n42\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nOur brand and reputation may be negatively impacted if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas, such as considering ESG factors in our investment processes. Adverse incidents with respect to ESG activities could impact the value of our brand and our relationships with investors, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\n\nAdditionally, new regulatory initiatives related to ESG could adversely affect our business. For example, the SEC has announced that it may require disclosure of certain ESG-related matters. There is a risk that a significant reorientation in the market following the implementation of these and further measures could be adverse to our portfolio companies if they are perceived to be less valuable as a consequence of, e.g., their carbon footprint or \u201cgreenwashing\u201d (i.e., the holding out of a product as having green or sustainable characteristics where this is not, in fact, the case). At this time, there is uncertainty regarding the scope of such proposals or when they would become effective (if at all). Compliance with any new laws or regulations increases our regulatory burden and could make compliance more difficult and expensive, affect the manner in which we or our portfolio companies conduct our businesses and adversely affect our profitability.\n\n\nPortfolio Company Investments\n\n\nOur investments are very risky and highly speculative.\n\n\nWe invest primarily through direct originations of secured debt, including first lien, unitranche, and last-out portions of such loans; second lien debt; unsecured debt, including mezzanine debt; and select equity investments. The securities in which we invest typically are not rated by any rating agency, and if they were rated, they would be below investment grade (rated lower than \u201cBaa3\u201d by Moody\u2019s Investors Service and lower than \u201cBBB-\u201d by Fitch Ratings or S&P). These securities, which may be referred to as \u201cjunk bonds,\u201d \u201chigh yield bonds\u201d or \u201cleveraged loans,\u201d have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer\u2019s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. In addition, some of the loans in which we may invest may be \u201ccovenant-lite\u201d loans. We use the term \u201ccovenant-lite\u201d loans to refer generally to loans that do not have a complete set of financial maintenance covenants. Generally, \u201ccovenant-lite\u201d loans provide borrower companies more freedom to negatively impact lenders because their covenants are incurrence-based, which means they are only tested and can only be breached following an affirmative action of the borrower, rather than by a deterioration in the borrower\u2019s financial condition. Accordingly, to the extent we invest in \u201ccovenant-lite\u201d loans, we may have fewer rights against a borrower and may have a greater risk of loss on such investments as compared to investments in or exposure to loans with financial maintenance covenants. Therefore, our investments may result in an above-average amount of risk and volatility or loss of principal. We also may invest in other assets, including U.S. government securities and structured securities. These investments entail additional risks that could adversely affect our investment returns.\n\n\nSecured Debt.\n When we make a secured debt investment, we generally take a security interest in the available assets of the portfolio company, including the equity interests of any subsidiaries, which we expect to help mitigate the risk that we will not be repaid. However, there is a risk that the collateral securing our debt investment may decrease in value over time, may be difficult to sell in a timely manner, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based upon the success of the business and market conditions, including as a result of the inability of the portfolio company to raise additional capital. In some circumstances, our lien could be subordinated to claims of other creditors, such as trade creditors. In addition, deterioration in a portfolio company\u2019s financial condition and prospects, including its inability to raise additional capital, may be accompanied by deterioration in the value of the collateral for the debt investment. Consequently, the fact that our debt is secured does not guarantee that we will receive principal and interest payments according to the debt investment\u2019s terms, or at all, or that we will be able to collect on the loan, in full or at all, should we enforce our remedies.\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nUnsecured Debt, including Mezzanine Debt.\n Our unsecured debt investments, including mezzanine debt investments, generally will be subordinated to senior debt in the event of an insolvency. This may result in an above average amount of risk and loss of principal.\n\n\nEquity Investments.\n When we invest in secured debt or unsecured debt, including mezzanine debt, we may acquire equity securities from the company in which we make the investment. In addition, we may invest in the equity securities of portfolio companies independent of any debt investment. Our goal is ultimately to dispose of such equity interests and realize gains upon our disposition of such interests. However, the equity interests we hold may not appreciate in value and, in fact, may decline in value. Accordingly, we may not be able to realize gains from our equity interests, and any gains that we do realize on the disposition of any equity interests may not be sufficient to offset any other losses we experience.\n\n\nInvesting in middle-market companies involves a number of significant risks.\n\n\nInvesting in middle-market companies involves a number of significant risks, including:\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nsuch companies may have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations under their debt securities that we hold, which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of any collateral and a reduction in the likelihood of us realizing any guarantees we may have obtained in connection with our investment;\n\n\n\u2022\nsuch companies typically have shorter operating histories, narrower product lines and smaller market shares than larger businesses, which tend to render them more vulnerable to competitors\u2019 actions and market conditions, as well as general economic downturns;\n\n\n43\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u2022\nsuch companies are more likely to depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of persons; therefore, the death, disability, resignation or termination of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on our portfolio company and, in turn, on us;\n\n\n\u2022\nsuch companies generally have less predictable operating results, may from time to time be parties to litigation, may be engaged in rapidly changing businesses with products subject to a substantial risk of obsolescence and may require substantial additional capital to support their operations, finance expansion or maintain their competitive position;\n\n\n\u2022\nthere is generally little public information about these companies, they and their financial information are not subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and other regulations that govern public companies and we may be unable to uncover all material information about these companies, which may prevent us from making a fully informed investment decision and cause us to lose money on our investments;\n\n\n\u2022\nour executive officers, directors and Investment Adviser may, in the ordinary course of business, be named as defendants in litigation arising from our investments in the portfolio companies; and\n\n\n\u2022\nsuch companies may have difficulty accessing the capital markets to meet future capital needs, which may limit their ability to grow or to repay their outstanding indebtedness, including any debt securities held by us, upon maturity.\n\n\nMany of our portfolio securities do not have a readily available market price, and we value these securities at fair value as determined in good faith under procedures adopted by our Board of Directors, which valuation is inherently subjective and may not reflect what we may actually realize for the sale of the investment.\n\n\nThe majority of our investments are, and are expected to continue to be, in debt instruments that do not have readily ascertainable market prices. The fair value of assets that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available are determined in good faith under procedures adopted by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors utilizes the services of independent third-party valuation firms (\u201cIndependent Valuation Advisors\u201d) in determining the fair value of a portion of the securities in our portfolio as of each quarter end. Investment professionals from our Investment Adviser also prepare portfolio company valuations using sources and/or proprietary models depending on the availability of information on our assets and the type of asset being valued, all in accordance with our valuation policy. The participation of our Investment Adviser in our valuation process could result in a conflict of interest, since the Management Fee is based in part on our gross assets and also because our Investment Adviser is receiving a performance-based Incentive Fee.\n\n\nBecause fair valuations, and particularly fair valuations of private securities and private companies, are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time and are often based to a large extent on estimates, comparisons and qualitative evaluations of private information, it may be more difficult for investors to value accurately our investments and could lead to undervaluation or overvaluation of our common stock. In addition, the valuation of these types of securities may result in substantial write-downs and earnings volatility.\n\n\nOur NAV as of a particular date may be materially greater than or less than the value that would be realized if our assets were to be liquidated as of such date. For example, if we were required to sell a certain asset or all or a substantial portion of our assets on a particular date, the actual price that we would realize upon the disposition of such asset or assets could be materially less than the value of such asset or assets as reflected in our NAV. Volatile market conditions could also cause reduced liquidity in the market for certain assets, which could result in liquidation values that are materially less than the values of such assets as reflected in our NAV.\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nThe lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business.\n\n\nVarious restrictions render our investments relatively illiquid, which may adversely affect our business. As we generally make investments in private companies, substantially all of these investments are subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or are otherwise less liquid than publicly traded securities. Our Investment Adviser is not permitted to obtain or use material non-public information in effecting purchases and sales in public securities transactions for us, which could create an additional limitation on the liquidity of our investments. The illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments if the need arises. Therefore, if we are required to or desire to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded our investments or could be unable to dispose of our investments in a timely manner or at such times as we deem advisable.\n\n\nOur portfolio may be focused in a limited number of portfolio companies, which will subject us to a risk of significant loss if any of these companies default on their obligations under any of their debt instruments or if there is a downturn in a particular industry.\n\n\nWe are classified as a non-diversified investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act, which means that we are not limited by the Investment Company Act with respect to the proportion of our assets that we may invest in securities of a single issuer, excluding limitations on investments in certain other financial and investment companies. To the extent that we assume large positions in the securities of a small number of issuers or industries, our NAV may fluctuate to a greater extent than that of a diversified investment company as a result of changes in the financial condition or the market\u2019s assessment of the issuer. We may also be more susceptible to any single economic or regulatory occurrence than a diversified investment company. In addition, the aggregate returns we realize may be significantly adversely affected if a small number of investments perform poorly or if we need to write down the value of any one investment. Additionally, a downturn in any particular industry in which we are invested could significantly affect our aggregate returns. Further, any industry in which we are\n \n\n\n44\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nmeaningfully concentrated at any given time could be subject to significant risks that could adversely impact our aggregate returns. For example, as of December 31, 2021, Health Care Technology, together with Health Care Providers & Services and Health Care Equipment & Supplies, represented 24.5% of our portfolio at fair value. Our investments in Health Care Technology, Health Care Providers & Services and Health Care Equipment & Supplies are subject to substantial risks, including, but not limited to, the risk that the laws and regulations governing the business of health care companies, and interpretations thereof, may change frequently. Current or future laws and regulations could force our portfolio companies engaged in health care, to change their policies related to how they operate, restrict revenue, change costs, change reserve levels and change business practices. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, Software represented 13.5% of our portfolio at fair value. Our investments in Software is subject to substantial risks, including, but not limited to, intense competition, changing technology, shifting user needs, frequent introductions of new products and services, competitors in different industries and ranging from large established companies to emerging startups, decreasing average selling prices of products and services resulting from rapid technological changes, cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents and various legal and regulatory risks.\n\n\nWe may not be in a position to exercise control over our portfolio companies or to prevent decisions by management of our portfolio companies that could decrease the value of our investments.\n\n\nWe do not generally hold controlling equity positions in our portfolio companies. While we are obligated as a BDC to offer to make managerial assistance available to our portfolio companies, there can be no assurance that management personnel of our portfolio companies will accept or rely on such assistance. To the extent that we do not hold a controlling equity interest in a portfolio company, we are subject to the risk that such portfolio company may make business decisions with which we disagree, and the stockholders and management of such portfolio company may take risks or otherwise act in ways that are adverse to our interests. Due to the lack of liquidity for the debt and equity investments that we typically hold in our portfolio companies, we may not be able to dispose of our investments in the event we disagree with the actions of a portfolio company and may therefore suffer a decrease in the value of our investments.\n\n\nIn addition, we may not be in a position to control any portfolio company by investing in its debt securities. As a result, we are subject to the risk that a portfolio company in which we invest may make business decisions with which we disagree and the management of such company, as representatives of the holders of their common equity, may take risks or otherwise act in ways that do not serve our interests as debt investors.\n\n\nWe may be subject to risks associated with investments in real estate loans.\n\n\nOur Investment Adviser, on our behalf, may periodically invest in loans related to real estate and real estate-related assets, and such investments will be subject to the risks inherent to investment in real estate-related assets generally. These risks include, but are not limited to, regional, national and international economic conditions, the supply and demand for properties, the financial resources of tenants, buyers and sellers of properties, changes in building, environmental, zoning and other laws and regulations, changes in real property tax rates, changes in interest rates and the availability of financing, which may render the sale or refinancing of properties difficult or impracticable, environmental liabilities, uninsured losses, acts of God, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, acts of war (declared and undeclared), strikes and other factors which are beyond the control of our Investment Adviser and us.\n\n\nThe effect of global climate change may impact the operations of our portfolio companies.\n\n\nThere may be evidence of global climate change. Climate change creates physical and financial risk and some of our portfolio companies may be adversely affected by climate change. For example, the needs of customers of energy companies vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity. To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of any changes. Increases in the cost of energy could adversely affect the cost of operations of our portfolio companies if the use of energy products or services is material to their business. A decrease in energy use due to weather changes may affect some of our portfolio companies\u2019 financial condition through, for example, decreased revenues. Extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stresses, including service interruptions.\n\n\nInflation may adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of our Portfolio Companies.\n\n\nCertain of our Portfolio Companies may be impacted by inflation. If such Portfolio Companies are unable to pass any increases in their costs along to their customers, it could adversely affect their results and impact their ability to pay interest and principal on our loans. In addition, any projected future decreases in our Portfolio Companies\u2019 operating results due to inflation could adversely impact the fair value of those investments. Any decreases in the fair value of our investments could result in future unrealized losses and therefore reduce our net assets resulting from operations.\n\n\nOur failure to make follow-on investments in our portfolio companies could impair the value of our portfolio.\n\n\nFollowing an initial investment in a portfolio company, we may make additional investments in that portfolio company as \u201cfollow-on\u201d investments, in order to:\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nincrease or maintain in whole or in part our equity ownership percentage or debt participation;\n\n\n\u2022\nexercise warrants, options or convertible securities that were acquired in the original or subsequent financing; or\n\n\n45\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u2022\nattempt to preserve or enhance the value of our investment.\n\n\nWe may elect not to make follow-on investments or may lack sufficient funds to make those investments.\n\n\nWe will have the discretion to make any follow-on investments, subject to the availability of capital resources. The failure to make follow-on investments may, in some circumstances, jeopardize the continued viability of a portfolio company and our initial investment, or may result in a missed opportunity for us to increase our participation in a successful operation. Even if we have sufficient capital to make a desired follow-on investment, we may elect not to make a follow-on investment because we may not want to increase our concentration of risk, because we prefer other opportunities or because we are inhibited by compliance with BDC requirements, compliance with covenants contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness or compliance with the requirements for maintenance of our RIC status.\n\n\nOur portfolio companies may prepay loans, which may reduce stated yields in the future if the capital returned cannot be invested in transactions with equal or greater expected yields.\n\n\nCertain of the loans we make are prepayable at any time, with some prepayable at no premium to par. We cannot predict when such loans may be prepaid. Whether a loan is prepaid will depend both on the continued positive performance of the portfolio company and the existence of favorable financing market conditions that permit such company to replace existing financing with less expensive capital. In periods of rising interest rates, the risk of prepayment of floating rate loans may increase if other financing sources are available. As market conditions change frequently, it is unknown when, and if, this may be possible for each portfolio company. In the case of some of these loans, having the loan prepaid early may reduce the achievable yield for us in the future below the current yield disclosed for our portfolio if the capital returned cannot be invested in transactions with equal or greater expected yields.\n\n\nInvestments in common and preferred equity securities, many of which are illiquid with no readily available market, involve a substantial degree of risk.\n\n\nAlthough common stock has historically generated higher average total returns than fixed income securities over the long term, common stock also has experienced significantly more volatility in those returns. Our equity investments may fail to appreciate and may decline in value or become worthless, and our ability to recover our investment will depend on our portfolio company\u2019s success. Investments in equity securities involve a number of significant risks, including:\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nany equity investment we make in a portfolio company could be subject to further dilution as a result of the issuance of additional equity interests and to serious risks as a junior security that will be subordinate to all indebtedness (including trade creditors) or senior securities in the event that the issuer is unable to meet its obligations or becomes subject to a bankruptcy process;\n\n\n\u2022\nto the extent that the portfolio company requires additional capital and is unable to obtain it, we may not recover our investment; and\n\n\n\u2022\nin some cases, equity securities in which we invest will not pay current dividends, and our ability to realize a return on our investment, as well as to recover our investment, will be dependent on the success of the portfolio company.\n\n\nEven if the portfolio company is successful, our ability to realize the value of our investment may be dependent on the occurrence of a liquidity event, such as a public offering or the sale of the portfolio company. It is likely to take a significant amount of time before a liquidity event occurs or we can otherwise sell our investment. In addition, the equity securities we receive or invest in may be subject to restrictions on resale during periods in which it could be advantageous to sell them.\n\n\nThere are special risks associated with investing in preferred securities, including:\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\npreferred securities may include provisions that permit the issuer, at its discretion, to defer distributions for a stated period without any adverse consequences to the issuer. If we own a preferred security that is deferring its distributions, we may be required to report income for tax purposes before we receive such distributions;\n\n\n\u2022\npreferred securities are subordinated to debt in terms of priority to income and liquidation payments, and therefore will be subject to greater credit risk than debt; \n\n\n\u2022\npreferred securities may be substantially less liquid than many other securities, such as common stock or U.S. government securities; and\n\n\n\u2022\ngenerally, preferred security holders have no voting rights with respect to the issuing company, subject to limited exceptions.\n\n\nAdditionally, when we invest in debt securities, we may acquire warrants or other equity securities as well. Our goal is ultimately to dispose of such equity interests and realize gains upon our disposition of such interests. However, the equity interests we receive may not appreciate in value and, in fact, may decline in value. Accordingly, we may not be able to realize gains from our equity interests and any gains that we do realize on the disposition of any equity interests may not be sufficient to offset any other losses we experience.\n\n\n46\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nWe may invest, to the extent permitted by law, in the equity securities of investment funds that are operating pursuant to certain exceptions to the Investment Company Act and, to the extent we so invest, will bear our ratable share of any such company\u2019s expenses, including management and performance fees. We will also remain obligated to pay the Management Fee and Incentive Fee to our Investment Adviser with respect to the assets invested in the securities and instruments of such companies. With respect to each of these investments, each of our common stockholders will bear his or her share of the Management Fee and Incentive Fee due to our Investment Adviser as well as indirectly bearing the management and performance fees and other expenses of any such investment funds or advisers.\n\n\nBy originating loans to companies that are experiencing significant financial or business difficulties, we may be exposed to distressed lending risks.\n\n\nAs part of our lending activities, we may originate loans to companies that are experiencing significant financial or business difficulties, including companies involved in bankruptcy or other reorganization and liquidation proceedings. Although the terms of such financing may result in significant financial returns to us, they involve a substantial degree of risk. The level of analytical sophistication, both financial and legal, necessary for successful financing to companies experiencing significant business and financial difficulties is unusually high. There is no assurance that we will correctly evaluate the value of the assets collateralizing our loans or the prospects for a successful reorganization or similar action. In any reorganization or liquidation proceeding relating to a company that we fund, we may lose all or part of the amounts advanced to the borrower or may be required to accept collateral with a value less than the amount of the loan advanced by us to the borrower.\n\n\nWe may be exposed to special risks associated with bankruptcy cases.\n\n\nMany of the events within a bankruptcy case are adversarial and often beyond the control of the creditors. While creditors generally are afforded an opportunity to object to significant actions, there can be no assurance that a bankruptcy court would not approve actions that may be contrary to our interests. Furthermore, there are instances where creditors can lose their ranking and priority if they are considered to have taken over management of a borrower.\n\n\nThe reorganization of a company can involve substantial legal, professional and administrative costs to a lender and the borrower; it is subject to unpredictable and lengthy delays; and during the process a company\u2019s competitive position may erode, key management may depart and a company may not be able to invest its capital adequately. In some cases, the debtor company may not be able to reorganize and may be required to liquidate assets. The debt of companies in financial reorganization will, in most cases, not pay current interest, may not accrue interest during reorganization and may be adversely affected by an erosion of the issuer\u2019s fundamental value.\n\n\nIn addition, lenders can be subject to lender liability claims for actions taken by them where they become too involved in the borrower\u2019s business or exercise control over the borrower. For example, we could become subject to a lender\u2019s liability claim, if, among other things, the borrower requests significant managerial assistance from us and we provide such assistance as contemplated by the Investment Company Act.\n\n\nDeclines in market prices and liquidity in the corporate debt markets can result in significant net unrealized depreciation of our portfolio, which in turn would affect our results of operations.\n\n\nAs a BDC, we are required to carry our investments at market value or, if no market value is ascertainable, at fair value as determined in good faith under procedures adopted by our Board of Directors. We may take into account the following types of factors, if relevant, in determining the fair value of our investments: the enterprise value of a portfolio company (the entire value of the portfolio company to a market participant, including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time), the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company\u2019s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow (taking into consideration current market interest rates and credit spreads), the markets in which the portfolio company does business, a comparison of the portfolio company\u2019s securities to similar publicly traded securities and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we use the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate our valuation. While most of our investments are not publicly traded, applicable accounting standards require us to assume as part of our valuation process that our investments are sold in a principal market to market participants (even if we plan on holding an investment through its maturity). As a result, volatility in the capital markets can also adversely affect our investment valuations. Decreases in the market values or fair values of our investments are recorded as unrealized depreciation. The effect of all of these factors on our portfolio can reduce our NAV by increasing net unrealized depreciation in our portfolio. Depending on market conditions, we could incur substantial realized losses and may suffer unrealized losses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\nEconomic recessions or downturns could impair our portfolio companies and harm our operating results.\n\n\nOur portfolio companies may be susceptible to economic downturns or recessions and may be unable to repay our loans during these periods. Therefore, during these periods our non-performing assets may increase and the value of our portfolio may decrease if we are required to write down the values of our investments. Adverse economic conditions may also decrease the value of collateral securing some of our loans and the value of our equity investments. Economic slowdowns or recessions could lead to financial losses in our portfolio and a decrease in revenues, net income and assets. Unfavorable economic conditions also could increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. These events could prevent us from increasing investments and harm our operating results.\n\n\n47\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nA portfolio company\u2019s failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by us or other lenders could lead to defaults and, potentially, acceleration of the time when the loans are due and foreclosure on the portfolio company\u2019s assets representing collateral for its obligations. This could trigger cross defaults under other agreements and jeopardize our portfolio company\u2019s ability to meet its obligations under the debt that we hold and the value of any equity securities we own. In addition, some of the loans in which we may invest may be \u201ccovenant-lite\u201d loans. We use the term \u201ccovenant-lite\u201d loans to refer generally to loans that do not have a complete set of financial maintenance covenants. Generally, \u201ccovenant-lite\u201d loans provide borrower companies more freedom to negatively impact lenders because their covenants are incurrence-based, which means they are only tested and can only be breached following an affirmative action of the borrower, rather than by a deterioration in the borrower\u2019s financial condition. Accordingly, to the extent we invest in \u201ccovenant-lite\u201d loans, we may have fewer rights against a borrower and may have a greater risk of loss on such investments as compared to investments in or exposure to loans with financial maintenance covenants. We may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms with a defaulting portfolio company.\n\n\nOur portfolio companies may have incurred or issued, or may in the future incur or issue, debt or equity securities that rank equally with, or senior to, our investments in such companies, which could have an adverse effect on us in any liquidation of the portfolio company.\n\n\nOur portfolio companies may have, or may be permitted to incur, other debt, or issue other equity securities that rank equally with, or senior to, our investments. By their terms, such instruments may provide that the holders are entitled to receive payment of dividends, interest or principal on or before the dates on which we are entitled to receive payments in respect of our investments. These debt instruments would usually prohibit the portfolio companies from paying interest on or repaying our investments in the event and during the continuance of a default under such debt. Also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a portfolio company, holders of securities ranking senior to our investment in that portfolio company typically are entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any distribution in respect of our investment. After repaying such holders, the portfolio company may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying its obligation to us. In the case of securities ranking equally with our investments, we would have to share on an equal basis any distributions with other security holders in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of the relevant portfolio company.\n\n\nAdditionally, certain loans that we make to portfolio companies may be secured on a second priority basis by the same collateral securing senior secured debt, which will be secured on a first priority basis. The first priority liens on the collateral will secure the portfolio company\u2019s obligations under any outstanding senior debt and may secure certain other future debt that may be permitted to be incurred by the portfolio company under the agreements governing the loans. The holders of obligations secured by the first priority liens on the collateral will generally control the liquidation of and be entitled to receive proceeds from any realization of the collateral to repay their obligations in full before us. In addition, the value of the collateral in the event of liquidation will depend on market and economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. There can be no assurance that the proceeds, if any, from the sale or sales of all of the collateral would be sufficient to satisfy the loan obligations secured by the second priority liens after payment in full of all obligations secured by the first priority liens. If such proceeds are not sufficient to repay amounts outstanding under the loan obligations secured by the second priority liens, then we, to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the collateral, will only have an unsecured claim against the portfolio company\u2019s remaining assets, if any.\n\n\nThe rights we may have with respect to the collateral securing any junior priority loans we make to our portfolio companies may also be limited pursuant to the terms of one or more intercreditor agreements that we enter into with the holders of senior debt. Under such an intercreditor agreement, at any time that senior obligations are outstanding, we may forfeit certain rights with respect to the collateral to the holders of the senior obligations. These rights may include the right to commence enforcement proceedings against the collateral, the right to control the conduct of such enforcement proceedings, the right to approve amendments to collateral documents, the right to release liens on the collateral and the right to waive past defaults under collateral documents. We may not have the ability to control or direct such actions, even if our rights as junior lenders are adversely affected. In addition, a bankruptcy court may choose not to enforce an intercreditor agreement or other arrangement with creditors. Similar risks to the foregoing may apply where we hold the last-out piece of a unitranche loan.\n\n\nWe may also make unsecured loans to portfolio companies, meaning that such loans will not benefit from any interest in collateral of such companies. Liens on such portfolio companies\u2019 collateral, if any, will secure the portfolio company\u2019s obligations under its outstanding secured debt and may secure certain future debt that is permitted to be incurred by the portfolio company under its secured loan agreements. The holders of obligations secured by such liens will generally control the liquidation of, and be entitled to receive proceeds from, any realization of such collateral to repay their obligations in full before us. In addition, the value of such collateral in the event of liquidation will depend on market and economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. There can be no assurance that the proceeds, if any, from sales of such collateral would be sufficient to satisfy our unsecured loan obligations after payment in full of all secured loan obligations. If such proceeds were not sufficient to repay the outstanding secured loan obligations, then our unsecured claims would rank equally with the unpaid portion of such secured creditors\u2019 claims against the portfolio company\u2019s remaining assets, if any.\n\n\nOur portfolio companies may be highly leveraged.\n\n\nSome of our portfolio companies may be highly leveraged, which may have adverse consequences to these companies and to us as an investor. These companies may be subject to restrictive financial and operating covenants and the leverage may impair these companies\u2019 ability to\n \n\n\n48\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nfinance their future operations and capital needs. As a result, these companies\u2019 flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and to take advantage of business opportunities may be limited. Further, a leveraged company\u2019s income and net assets will tend to increase or decrease at a greater rate than if borrowed money were not used.\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nOur investments in non-U.S. companies may involve significant risks in addition to the risks inherent in U.S. investments.\n\n\nOur investment strategy contemplates potential investments in securities of non-U.S. companies to the extent permissible under the Investment Company Act. Investing in non-U.S. companies may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. companies. These risks include changes in exchange control regulations, political and social instability, expropriation, imposition of non-U.S. taxes (potentially at confiscatory levels), less liquid markets, less available information than is generally the case in the United States, higher transaction costs, less government supervision of exchanges, brokers and issuers, less developed bankruptcy laws, difficulty in enforcing contractual obligations, lack of uniform accounting and auditing standards and greater price volatility. These risks are likely to be more pronounced for investments in companies located in emerging markets and particularly for middle-market companies in these economies.\n\n\nAlthough most of our investments are denominated in U.S. dollars, our investments that are denominated in a non-U.S. currency will be subject to the risk that the value of a particular currency will change in relation to the U.S. dollar. Among the factors that may affect currency values are trade balances, the level of short-term interest rates, differences in relative values of similar assets in different currencies, long-term opportunities for investment and capital appreciation and political developments. We may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks, but we cannot assure you that such strategies will be effective or without risk to us.\n\n\nWe may expose ourselves to risks if we engage in hedging transactions.\n\n\nSubject to applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act and applicable CFTC regulations, we may enter into hedging transactions in a manner consistent with SEC guidance, which may expose us to risks associated with such transactions. Such hedging may utilize instruments such as forward contracts, currency options and interest rate swaps, caps, collars and floors to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates and market interest rates. Use of these hedging instruments may include counter-party credit risk.\n\n\nHedging against a decline in the values of our portfolio positions does not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the values of such positions or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline. However, such hedging can establish other positions designed to gain from those same developments, thereby offsetting the decline in the value of such portfolio positions. Such hedging transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the values of the underlying portfolio positions should increase. Moreover, it may not be possible to hedge against an exchange rate or interest rate fluctuation that is so generally anticipated that we are not able to enter into a hedging transaction at an acceptable price.\n\n\nThe success of any hedging transactions we may enter into will depend on our ability to correctly predict movements in currencies and interest rates. Therefore, while we may enter into such transactions to seek to reduce currency exchange rate and interest rate risks, unanticipated changes in currency exchange rates or interest rates may result in poorer overall investment performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions. In addition, the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in a hedging strategy and price movements in the portfolio positions being hedged may vary. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek to (or be able to) establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the portfolio holdings being hedged. Any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss. In addition, it may not be possible to hedge fully or perfectly against currency fluctuations affecting the value of securities denominated in non-U.S. currencies because the value of those securities is likely to fluctuate as a result of factors not related to currency fluctuations.

This would involve contributing a pool of assets to a special purpose entity, and selling debt interests in such entity on a non-recourse or limited-recourse basis to purchasers. Any interest in any such CLO held by us may be considered a \u201cnon-qualifying asset\u201d for purposes of Section 55 of the Investment Company Act.\n\n\nIf we create a CLO, we will depend on distributions from the CLO\u2019s assets out of its earnings and cash flows to enable us to make distributions to our stockholders. The ability of a CLO to make distributions will be subject to various limitations, including the terms and covenants of the debt it issues. For example, tests (based on interest coverage or other financial ratios or other criteria) may restrict our ability, as holder of a CLO\u2019s equity interests, to receive cash flow from these investments. There is no assurance any such performance tests will be satisfied. Also, a CLO may take actions that delay distributions in order to preserve ratings and to keep the cost of present and future financings lower or the CLO may be obligated to retain cash or other assets to satisfy over-collateralization requirements commonly provided for holders of the CLO\u2019s debt. As a result, there may be a lag, which could be significant, between the repayment or other realization on a loan or other assets in, and the distribution of cash out of, a CLO, or cash flow may be completely restricted for the life of the CLO. If we do not receive cash flow from any such CLO that is necessary to satisfy the annual distribution requirement for maintaining our RIC status, and we are unable to obtain cash from other sources necessary to satisfy this requirement, we could fail to maintain our status as a RIC, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, a decline in the credit quality of loans in a CLO due to poor operating results of the relevant borrower, declines in the value of loan collateral or increases in defaults, among other things, may force a CLO to sell certain assets at a loss, reducing their earnings and, in turn, cash potentially available for distribution to us for distribution to our stockholders.\n\n\nTo the extent that any losses are incurred by the CLO in respect of any collateral, such losses will be borne first by us as owner of equity interests. Finally, any equity interests that we retain in a CLO will not be secured by the assets of the CLO and we will rank behind all creditors of the CLO.\n\n\nOur Securities\n\n\nInvesting in our securities involves an above average degree of risk.\n\n\nThe investments we make in accordance with our investment objective may result in a higher amount of risk than alternative investment options and volatility or loss of principal. Our investments in portfolio companies may be highly speculative and aggressive, and therefore an investment in our securities may not be suitable for someone with lower risk tolerance.\n\n\nThe market price of our securities may fluctuate significantly.\n\n\nThe market price and liquidity of the market for our securities may be significantly affected by numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be directly related to our operating performance. These factors include:\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nsignificant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of BDCs or other companies in our sector, which are not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies;\n\n\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\n\n\u2022\nthe inclusion or exclusion of our securities from certain indices;\n\n\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory policies or tax guidelines, particularly with respect to RICs or BDCs;\n\n\n\u2022\nany loss of RIC or BDC status;\n\n\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings or perceived changes or variations in operating results;\n\n\n\u2022\nchanges or perceived changes in the value of our portfolio of investments;\n\n\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting guidelines governing valuation of our investments;\n\n\n\u2022\nany shortfall in revenue or net income or any increase in losses from levels expected by investors or securities analysts;\n\n\n\u2022\nthe inability of our Investment Adviser to employ additional experienced investment professionals or the departure of any of our Investment Adviser\u2019s key personnel;\n\n\n\u2022\nshort-selling pressure with respect to shares of our common stock or BDCs generally;\n\n\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock or the conversion of such securities;\n\n\n\u2022\nuncertainty surrounding the strength of the U.S. economic recovery;\n\n\n\u2022\nconcerns regarding European sovereign debt;\n\n\n\u2022\noperating performance of companies comparable to us;\n\n\n\u2022\ngeneral economic trends and other external factors; and\n\n\n50\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u2022\nloss of a major funding source.\n\n\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. If our stock price fluctuates significantly, we may be the target of securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.\n\n\nShares of closed-end investment companies, including BDCs, frequently trade at a discount to their NAV per share.\n\n\nWe cannot predict the prices at which our common stock will trade. Shares of closed-end investment companies, including BDCs, frequently trade at a discount from their NAV and our common stock may also be discounted in the market. This characteristic of closed-end investment companies is separate and distinct from the risk that our NAV per share of common stock may decline. We cannot predict whether our common stock will trade at, above or below NAV. In addition, if our common stock trades below its NAV, we will generally not be able to sell additional shares of our common stock to the public at its market price without first obtaining the approval of a majority of our stockholders (including a majority of our unaffiliated stockholders) and our Independent Directors for such issuance.\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\n\n\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock, the availability of such common stock for sale (including as a result of the conversion of our 4.50% Convertible Notes due 2022 (the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d) into common stock) or the perception that such sales could occur could materially adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock. Both the sale of a substantial amount of our securities and the perception that such sales could occur could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities should we desire to do so. Additionally, as an owner of approximately 6.37% of our common stock as of December 31, 2021, Group Inc. is a significant stockholder that may decide to sell a substantial amount of its common stock, subject to applicable securities laws, and such a sale would exacerbate the effects described above.\n\n\nOur stockholders may experience dilution upon the conversion of our Convertible Notes.\n\n\nOur Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock beginning on October 1, 2021 or, under certain circumstances, earlier. Upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, we have the choice to pay or deliver, as the case may be, at our election, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. The initial conversion price of the Convertible Notes is $24.49, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. If we elect to deliver shares of common stock upon a conversion at the time our NAV per share exceeds the conversion price in effect at such time, our stockholders may incur dilution. In addition, our stockholders will experience dilution in their ownership percentage of common stock upon our issuance of common stock in connection with the conversion of the Convertible Notes and any dividends paid on our common stock will also be paid on shares issued in connection with such conversion after such issuance.\n\n\nOur stockholders will experience dilution in their ownership percentage if they opt out of our dividend reinvestment plan.\n\n\nWe have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan pursuant to which we reinvest all cash distributions declared by the Board of Directors on behalf of investors who do not elect to receive their distributions in cash. As a result, if the Board of Directors declares a cash distribution, then our stockholders who have not opted out of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution. See \u201cItem 5. Market for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\u2014Distributions\u201d and \u201cItem 1. Business\u2014Dividend Reinvestment Plan\u201d for a description of our distribution policy and obligations.\n\n\nIf, on the payment date for any distribution, the most recently computed NAV per share is equal to or less than the closing market price plus estimated per share fees (which include any applicable brokerage commissions the plan agent is required to pay), the plan agent will invest the distribution amount in newly issued shares on behalf of the participants. The number of newly issued shares to be credited to a participant\u2019s account will be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the distribution by the most recently computed NAV per share provided that, if the NAV is less than or equal to 95% of the then current market price per share, the dollar amount of the distribution will be divided by 95% of the market price on the payment date. Accordingly, participants in the dividend reinvestment plan may receive a greater number shares of our common stock than the number of shares associated with the market price of our common stock, resulting in dilution for other stockholders. Stockholders that opt out of our dividend reinvestment plan will experience dilution in their ownership percentage of our common stock over time. See \u201cItem 1. Business\u2014Dividend Reinvestment Plan.\u201d\n\n\nOur stockholders that do not opt out of our dividend reinvestment plan should generally expect to have current tax liabilities without receiving cash to pay such liabilities.\n\n\nUnder our dividend reinvestment plan, if we declare a cash distribution, our stockholders who have not elected to \u201copt out\u201d will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving the cash distributions. Stockholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of our common stock generally are subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences\n \n\n\n51\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nas stockholders who elect to receive their distributions in cash; however, since their distributions will be reinvested, those stockholders will not receive cash with which to pay any applicable taxes on such reinvested distributions. As a result, stockholders that have not opted out of our dividend reinvestment plan may have to use funds from other sources to pay any tax liabilities imposed upon them based on the value of the common stock received. See \u201cItem 1. Business\u2014Dividend Reinvestment Plan.\u201d\n\n\nWe may in the future determine to issue preferred stock, which could adversely affect the market value of our common stock.\n\n\nThe issuance of shares of preferred stock with dividend or conversion rights, liquidation preferences or other economic terms favorable to the holders of preferred stock could adversely affect the market price for our common stock by making an investment in the common stock less attractive. In addition, the dividends on any preferred stock we issue must be cumulative. Payment of dividends and repayment of the liquidation preference of preferred stock must take preference over any distributions or other payments to our common stockholders, and holders of preferred stock are not subject to any of our expenses or losses and are not entitled to participate in any income or appreciation in excess of their stated preference (other than convertible preferred stock that converts into common stock). In addition, under the Investment Company Act, participating preferred stock and preferred stock constitutes a \u201csenior security\u201d for purposes of the 150% asset coverage test. See \u201c\u2014Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital. These constraints may hinder our Investment Adviser\u2019s ability to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities and to achieve our investment objective.\u201d\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d), as well as other aspects of our structure, including the substantial ownership interest of Group Inc., could deter takeover attempts and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\n\n\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as the DGCL, contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us. Among other things, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nprovide that our Board of Directors is classified, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our Board of Directors;\n\n\n\u2022\ndo not provide for cumulative voting;\n\n\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our Board of Directors, including newly created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\n\n\u2022\nprovide that our directors may be removed only for cause, and only by a supermajority vote of the stockholders entitled to elect such directors;\n\n\n\u2022\nprovide that stockholders may only take action at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, and may not act by written consent;\n\n\n\u2022\nrestrict stockholders\u2019 ability to call special meetings;\n\n\n\u2022\nrequire a supermajority vote of stockholders to effect certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws; and\n\n\n\u2022\nrequire stockholders to provide advance notice of new business proposals and director nominations under specific procedures.\n\n\nWe have provisions comparable to those of Section 203 of the DGCL (other than with respect to Group Inc. and its affiliates and certain of its or their direct or indirect transferees and any group as to which such persons are a party). These provisions generally prohibit us from engaging in mergers, business combinations and certain other types of transactions with \u201cinterested stockholders\u201d (generally defined as persons or entities that beneficially own 15% or more of our voting stock), other than the exempt parties as described above, for a period of three years following the date the person became an interested stockholder unless, prior to such stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, our Board of Directors has approved the \u201cbusiness combination\u201d that would otherwise be restricted or the transaction that resulted in the interested stockholder becoming an interested stockholder or the subsequent transaction with the interested stockholder has been approved by our Board of Directors and 66\n2\n/\n3\n% of our outstanding voting stock (other than voting stock owned by the interested stockholder). Such provisions may discourage third parties from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating such an offer.\n\n\nThese anti-takeover provisions may inhibit a change of control in circumstances that could give the holders of our common stock the opportunity to realize a premium over the market price for the common stock. In addition, certain aspects of our structure, including the substantial ownership interest of Group Inc., may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us.\n\n\nWe may not be able to pay distributions to holders of our common stock or preferred stock, our distributions to holders of our common stock or preferred stock may not grow over time and a portion of our distributions to holders of our common stock or preferred stock may be a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\n\nWe intend to pay quarterly distributions to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution. We cannot assure you that we will achieve investment results that will allow us to make a specified level of cash distributions or year-to-year increases in cash distributions. If we are unable to satisfy the asset coverage test applicable to us as a BDC, or if we violate certain covenants under our Revolving Credit Facility and other debt financing agreements, our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders could be limited. All distributions will be paid at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, maintenance of our RIC status, compliance with\n \n\n\n52\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\napplicable BDC regulations, compliance with covenants under our Revolving Credit Facility and other debt financing agreements and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time.\n\n\nThe distributions we pay to our stockholders in a year may exceed our net ordinary income and capital gains for that year and, accordingly, a portion of such distributions may constitute a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes that would reduce a stockholder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in its shares of our common stock or preferred stock and correspondingly increase such stockholder\u2019s gain, or reduce such stockholder\u2019s loss, on disposition of such shares. Distributions in excess of a stockholder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in its shares of our common stock or preferred stock will generally constitute capital gains to such stockholder.\n\n\nStockholders who periodically receive the payment of a distribution from a RIC consisting of a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be under the impression that they are receiving a distribution of the RIC\u2019s net ordinary income or capital gains when they are not. Accordingly, stockholders should read carefully any written disclosure accompanying a distribution from us and the information about the specific tax characteristics of our distributions provided to stockholders after the end of each calendar year, and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our net ordinary income or capital gains.\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\nThe tax treatment of a non-U.S. stockholder in its jurisdiction of tax residence will depend entirely on the laws of such jurisdiction, and may vary considerably from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\n\n\nDepending on (i) the laws of such non-U.S. stockholder\u2019s jurisdiction of tax residence, (ii) how we, the investments and/or any other investment vehicles through which we directly or indirectly invest are treated in such jurisdiction, and (iii) the activities of any such entities, an investment in us could result in such non-U.S. stockholder recognizing adverse tax consequences in its jurisdiction of tax residence, including (a) with respect to any generally required or additional tax filings and/or additional disclosure required in such filings in relation to the treatment for tax purposes in the relevant jurisdiction of an interest in us, the investments and/or any other investment vehicles through which we directly or indirectly invest and/or of distributions from such entities and any uncertainties arising in that respect (our not being established under the laws of the relevant jurisdiction), (b) the possibility of taxable income significantly in excess of cash distributed to a non-U.S. stockholder, and possibly in excess of our actual economic income, (c) the possibilities of losing deductions or the ability to utilize tax basis and of sums invested being returned in the form of taxable income or gains, and (d) the possibility of being subject to tax at unfavorable tax rates. A non-U.S. stockholder may also be subject to restrictions on the use of its share of our deductions and losses in its jurisdiction of tax residence. Each prospective investor is urged to consult its own tax advisors with respect to the tax and tax filing consequences, if any, in its jurisdiction of tax residence of an investment in us, as well as any other jurisdiction in which such prospective investor is subject to taxation.\n\n\nWe may have difficulty paying our required distributions if we recognize taxable income before or without receiving cash representing such income.\n\n\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, we will include in our taxable income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as OID, which may occur if we receive warrants in connection with the origination of a loan or possibly in other circumstances or contracted PIK interest, which generally represents contractual interest added to the loan balance and due at the end of the loan term. Such OID, which could be significant relative to our overall investment assets, and increases in loan balances as a result of PIK interest will be included in our taxable income before we receive any corresponding cash payments. We also may be required to include in our taxable income other amounts that we have not yet received or will not receive in cash, such as accruals on a contingent payment debt instrument, accruals of interest income and/or OID on defaulted debt, or deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrants or stock.  Moreover, we generally will be required to take certain amounts in income no later than the time such amounts are reflected on our financial statements. The credit risk associated with the collectability of deferred payments may be increased as and when a portfolio company increases the amount of interest on which it is deferring cash payment through deferred interest features. Our investments with a deferred interest feature may represent a higher credit risk than loans for which interest must be paid in full in cash on a regular basis. For example, even if the accounting conditions for income accrual are met, the borrower could still default when our actual collection is scheduled to occur upon maturity of the obligation.\n\n\nBecause in certain cases we may recognize taxable income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty making distributions to our stockholders that will be sufficient to enable us to meet the annual distribution requirement necessary for us to maintain our status as a RIC. Accordingly, we may need to sell some of our assets at times and/or at prices that we would not consider advantageous, we may need to raise additional equity or debt capital, or we may need to forego new investment opportunities or otherwise take actions that are disadvantageous to our business (or be unable to take actions that are advantageous to our business) to enable us to make distributions to our stockholders that will be sufficient to enable us to meet the annual distribution requirement. If we are unable to obtain cash in the amount required for us to make, or if we are restricted from making, sufficient distributions to our stockholders to meet the annual distribution requirement, we may fail to qualify for the U.S. federal income tax benefits allowable to RICs and, thus, become subject to a corporate-level U.S. federal income tax (and any applicable U.S. state and local taxes).\n\n\n53\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nOur stockholders may receive shares of our common stock or preferred stock as distributions, which could result in adverse tax consequences to them.\n\n\nIn order to satisfy the annual distribution requirement applicable to RICs, we will have the ability to declare a large portion of a distribution in shares of our common stock or preferred stock instead of in cash. We are not subject to restrictions on the circumstances in which we may declare a portion of a distribution in shares of our stock but would generally anticipate doing so only in unusual situations, such as, for example, if we do not have sufficient cash to meet our RIC distribution requirements under the Code. Generally, were we to declare such a distribution, we would allow stockholders to elect payment in cash and/or shares of our stock of equivalent value. Under published IRS guidance, the entire distribution will generally be treated as a taxable distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and count towards our RIC distribution requirements under the Code, if certain conditions are satisfied. Among other things, the aggregate amount of cash available to be distributed to all stockholders is required to be at least 20% of the aggregate declared distribution. If too many stockholders elect to receive cash, the cash available for distribution is required to be allocated among the stockholders electing to receive cash (with the balance of the distribution paid in stock) under a formula provided in the applicable IRS guidance. The number of shares of our stock distributed would thus depend on the applicable percentage limitation on cash available for distribution, the stockholders\u2019 individual elections to receive cash or stock, and the value of the shares of our stock. Each stockholder generally would be treated as having received a taxable distribution (including for purposes of the withholding tax rules applicable to a Non-U.S. stockholder) on the date the distribution is received in an amount equal to the cash that such stockholder would have received if the entire distribution had been paid in cash, even if the stockholder received all or most of the distribution in shares of our common stock or preferred stock. We currently do not intend to pay distributions in shares of our common stock or preferred stock, but there can be no assurance that we will not do so in the future.\n\n\nIf we are not treated as a \u201cpublicly offered regulated investment company,\u201d as defined in the Code, U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts or estates will be taxed as though they received a distribution of some of our expenses.\n\n\nDuring the period when we have elected to be treated as a RIC, we expect to be treated as a \u201cpublicly offered regulated investment company\u201d as a result of either (i) shares of our common stock being held by at least 500 persons at all times during a taxable year or (ii) shares of our common stock being treated as regularly traded on an established securities market. However, we cannot assure you that we will be treated as a publicly offered regulated investment company for all years. If we are not treated as a publicly offered regulated investment company for any calendar year, each U.S. stockholder that is an individual, trust or estate will be treated as having received a dividend from us in the amount of such U.S. stockholder\u2019s allocable share of the management and incentive fees paid to our Investment Adviser and certain of our other expenses for the calendar year, and these fees and expenses will be treated as miscellaneous itemized deductions of such U.S. stockholder. Miscellaneous itemized deductions of a U.S. stockholder that is an individual, trust or estate are disallowed for tax years beginning before January 1, 2026 and thereafter generally are (i) deductible by such U.S. stockholders only to the extent that the aggregate of such U.S. stockholder\u2019s miscellaneous itemized deductions exceeds 2% of such U.S. stockholder\u2019s adjusted gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (ii) not deductible for purposes of the alternative minimum tax and (iii) are subject to the overall limitation on itemized deductions under the Code.\n\n\nNon-U.S. stockholders may be subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax on dividends we pay.\n\n\nDistributions of our \u201cinvestment company taxable income\u201d to a non-U.S. stockholder that are not effectively connected with the non-U.S. stockholder\u2019s conduct of a trade or business within the United States will generally be subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a 30% rate (or lower rate provided by an applicable income tax treaty) to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits.\n\n\nCertain properly reported distributions are generally exempt from withholding of U.S. federal income tax where they are paid in respect of our (i) \u201cqualified net interest income\u201d (generally, our U.S.-source interest income, other than certain contingent interest and interest from obligations of a corporation or partnership in which we or the non-U.S. stockholder are at least a 10% shareholder, reduced by expenses that are allocable to such income) or (ii) \u201cqualified short-term capital gains\u201d (generally, the excess of our net short-term capital gain over our net long-term capital loss for such taxable year), and certain other requirements are satisfied.\n\n\nNO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN AS TO WHETHER ANY OF OUR DISTRIBUTIONS WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS EXEMPTION FROM WITHHOLDING OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX. IN PARTICULAR, THIS EXEMPTION WILL NOT APPLY TO OUR DISTRIBUTIONS PAID IN RESPECT OF OUR NON-U.S. SOURCE INTEREST INCOME OR OUR DIVIDEND INCOME (OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF INCOME OTHER THAN GENERALLY OUR NON-CONTINGENT U.S. SOURCE INTEREST INCOME RECEIVED FROM UNRELATED OBLIGORS AND OUR QUALIFIED SHORT-TERM CAPITAL GAINS). IN THE CASE OF OUR COMMON STOCK OR PREFERRED STOCK HELD THROUGH AN INTERMEDIARY, THE INTERMEDIARY MAY WITHHOLD U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX EVEN IF WE REPORT THE PAYMENT AS QUALIFIED NET INTEREST INCOME OR QUALIFIED SHORT-TERM CAPITAL GAIN.\n\n\n54\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nPurchases of our common stock pursuant to any 10b5-1 plan or otherwise may result in the price of our common stock being higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market.\n\n\nWe are authorized to purchase up to $75.00 million of shares of our common stock if the stock trades below the most recently announced NAV per share (including any updates, corrections or adjustments publicly announced by us to any previously announced NAV per share), subject to certain limitations, commencing on a date to be determined by one or more of our officers. Any such purchases will be conducted in accordance with applicable securities laws. Whether purchases will be made under any 10b5-1 plan we may adopt or otherwise and how much will be purchased at any time is uncertain, dependent on prevailing market prices and trading volumes, all of which we cannot predict. These activities may have the effect of maintaining the market price of our common stock or retarding a decline in the market price of the common stock, and, as a result, the price of our common stock may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market.\n \n\n\nPurchases of our common stock by us under any 10b5-1 plan or otherwise may result in dilution to our NAV per share.\n\n\nWe are authorized to repurchase shares of common stock when the market price per share is below the most recently reported NAV per share (including any updates, corrections or adjustments publicly announced by us to any previously announced NAV per share), including under any 10b5-1 plan we may adopt, commencing on a date to be determined by one or more of our officers. Because purchases may be made beginning at any price below our most recently reported NAV per share, if our NAV per share decreases after the date as of which NAV per share was last reported, such purchases may result in dilution to our NAV per share. This dilution would occur because we would repurchase shares at a price above the then-current NAV per share, which would cause a proportionately smaller increase in our stockholders\u2019 interest in our earnings and assets and their voting interest in us than the decrease in our assets resulting from such repurchase. As a result of any such dilution, our market price per share may decline. The actual dilutive effect will depend on the number of shares of common stock that could be so repurchased, the price and the timing of any repurchases.\n \n\n\nTo the extent OID and PIK interest constitute a portion of our income, we will be exposed to typical risks associated with such income being required to be included in taxable and accounting income prior to receipt of cash representing such income.\n\n\nOur investments may include OID instruments and PIK, interest arrangements, which represents contractual interest added to a loan balance and due at the end of such loan\u2019s term. To the extent OID or PIK interest constitute a portion of our income, we are exposed to typical risks associated with such income being required to be included in taxable and accounting income prior to receipt of cash, including the following:\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nThe higher interest rates of OID and PIK instruments reflect the payment deferral and increased credit risk associated with these instruments, and OID and PIK instruments generally represent a significantly higher credit risk than coupon loans.\n\n\n\u2022\nEven if the accounting conditions for income accrual are met, the borrower could still default when our actual collection is supposed to occur at the maturity of the obligation.\n\n\n\u2022\nOID and PIK instruments may have unreliable valuations because their continuing accruals require continuing judgments about the collectability of the deferred payments and the value of any associated collateral. OID and PIK income may also create uncertainty about the source of our cash distributions.\n\n\n\u2022\nFor accounting purposes, any cash distributions to shareholders representing OID and PIK income are not treated as coming from paid-in capital, even if the cash to pay them comes from offering proceeds. As a result, despite the fact that a distribution representing OID and PIK income could be paid out of amounts invested by our stockholders, the Investment Company Act does not require that stockholders be given notice of this fact by reporting it as a return of capital.\n\n\nTerms relating to redemption may materially adversely affect your return on any debt securities that we may issue.\n\n\nIf our noteholders\u2019 debt securities are redeemable at our option, we may choose to redeem your debt securities at times when prevailing interest rates are lower than the interest rate paid on your debt securities. In addition, if our noteholders\u2019 debt securities are subject to mandatory redemption, we may be required to redeem such debt securities also at times when prevailing interest rates are lower than the interest rate paid on such debt securities. In this circumstance, a noteholder may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as the debt securities being redeemed.\n\n\nOur credit ratings may not reflect all risks of an investment in our debt securities.\n\n\nOur credit ratings are an assessment by third parties of our ability to pay our obligations. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of our debt securities. Our credit ratings, however, may not reflect the potential impact of risks related to market conditions generally or other factors discussed above on the market value of or trading market for the publicly issued debt securities.\n\n\n55\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nHolders of any preferred stock we might issue would have the right to elect members of the board of directors and class voting rights on certain matters.\n\n\nHolders of any preferred stock we might issue, voting separately as a single class, would have the right to elect two members of the board of directors at all times and in the event dividends become two full years in arrears would have the right to elect a majority of the directors until such arrearage is completely eliminated. In addition, preferred stockholders have class voting rights on certain matters, including changes in fundamental investment restrictions and conversion to open-end status, and accordingly can veto any such changes. Restrictions imposed on the declarations and payment of dividends or other distributions to the holders of our common stock and preferred stock, both by the Investment Company Act and by requirements imposed by rating agencies or the terms of our credit facilities, might impair our ability to maintain our qualification as a RIC for federal income tax purposes. While we would intend to redeem our preferred stock to the extent necessary to enable us to distribute our income as required to maintain our qualification as a RIC, there can be no assurance that such actions could be effected in time to meet the tax requirements.\n\n\nThere is a risk that investors in our equity securities may not receive distributions or that our distributions may not grow over time and that investors in our debt securities may not receive all of the interest income to which they are entitled.\n\n\nWe intend to make distributions on a quarterly basis to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution. We cannot assure you that we will achieve investment results that will allow us to make a specified level of cash distributions or year-to-year increases in cash distributions. In addition, due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a BDC, we may in the future be limited in our ability to make distributions. Also, our Revolving Credit Facility may limit our ability to declare dividends if we default under certain provisions or fail to satisfy certain other conditions. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of the tax benefits available to us as a RIC. In addition, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and tax rules, we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as contractual PIK interest, which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance that becomes due at the end of the loan term, or the accrual of original issue or market discount. Since we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to distribute at least 90% of our investment company taxable income to obtain tax benefits as a RIC.\n\n\nWe will be subject to a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax on certain undistributed income for a calendar year unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years. We will not be subject to excise taxes on amounts on which we are required to pay corporate income taxes (such as retained net capital gains).\n\n\nFinally, if more stockholders opt to receive cash distributions rather than participate in our dividend reinvestment plan, we may be forced to liquidate some of our investments and raise cash in order to make cash distribution payments.\n\n", "item7": ">ITEM 7.\tMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\n FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \n\n\nThe following discussion and other parts of this report contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties.

Please see \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with this discussion and analysis. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward-looking information due to factors discussed under \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d appearing elsewhere in this report.\n \n\n\nOVERVIEW\n \n\n\nWe are a specialty finance company focused on lending to middle-market companies. We are a closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company (\u201cBDC\u201d) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d). In addition, we have elected to be treated, and expect to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company (\u201cRIC\u201d) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2013. From our formation in 2012 through December 31, 2021, we originated more than $6.16 billion in aggregate principal amount of debt and equity investments prior to any subsequent exits and repayments. We seek to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation primarily through direct originations of secured debt, including first lien, unitranche, including last-out portions of such loans, and second lien debt, and unsecured debt, including mezzanine debt, as well as through select equity investments.\n\n\nWe may also originate \u201ccovenant-lite\u201d loans, which are loans with fewer financial maintenance covenants than other obligations, or no financial maintenance covenants, and may not include terms that allow the lender to monitor the performance of the borrower and declare a default if certain criteria are breached. Covenant-lite loans may carry more risk than traditional loans as they allow borrowers to engage in activities that would otherwise be difficult or impossible under a loan with a full package of covenants. In the event of default, covenant-lite loans may exhibit diminished recovery values as the lender may not have the opportunity to negotiate with the borrower prior to default.\n \n\n\n\u201cUnitranche\u201d loans are first lien loans that may extend deeper in a company\u2019s capital structure than traditional first lien debt and may provide for a waterfall of cash flow priority between different lenders in the unitranche loan. In a number of instances, we may find another lender to provide the \u201cfirst-out\u201d portion of such loan and retain the \u201clast-out\u201d portion of such loan, in which case, the \u201cfirst-out\u201d portion of the loan would generally receive priority with respect to payment of principal, interest and any other amounts due thereunder over the \u201clast-out\u201d portion that we would continue to hold. In exchange for the greater risk of loss, the \u201clast-out\u201d portion generally earns a higher interest rate than the \u201cfirst-out\u201d portion. We use the term \u201cmezzanine\u201d to refer to debt that ranks senior only to a borrower\u2019s equity securities and ranks junior in right of payment to all of such borrower\u2019s other indebtedness. We may make multiple investments in the same portfolio company.\n \n\n\nWe invest primarily in U.S. middle-market companies, which we believe are underserved by traditional providers of capital such as banks and the public debt markets. In this report, we generally use the term \u201cmiddle market companies\u201d to refer to companies with between $5 million and $200 million of annual earnings before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) excluding certain one-time, and non-recurring items that are outside the operations of these companies. However, we may from time to time invest in larger or smaller companies. We generate revenues primarily through receipt of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate income from various loan origination and other fees, dividends on direct equity investments and capital gains on the sales of investments. Fees received from portfolio companies (directors\u2019 fees, consulting fees, administrative fees, tax advisory fees and other similar compensation) are paid to us, unless, to the extent required by applicable law or exemptive relief therefrom, we only receive our allocable portion of such fees when invested in the same portfolio company as another client account managed by our Investment Adviser (including Goldman Sachs Private Middle Market Credit LLC (\u201cGS PMMC\u201d), Goldman Sachs Private Middle Market Credit II LLC (\u201cGS PMMC II\u201d) and Goldman Sachs Middle Market Lending Corp. II (\u201cGS MMLC II\u201d), collectively with other client accounts managed by our Investment Adviser, the \u201cAccounts\u201d). The companies in which we invest use our capital for a variety of purposes, including to support organic growth, fund acquisitions, make capital investments or refinance indebtedness.\n \n\n\nOur origination strategy focuses on leading the negotiation and structuring of the loans or securities in which we invest and holding the investments in our portfolio to maturity. In many cases, we are the sole investor in the loan or security in our portfolio. Where there are multiple investors, we generally seek to control or obtain significant influence over the rights of investors in the loan or security. We generally seek to make investments that have maturities between three and ten years and range in size between $10 million and $75 million, although we may make larger or smaller investments on occasion.\n \n\n\nFor a discussion of the competitive landscape we face, please see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u2013Competition\u2013We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities\u201d and \u201cItem 1. Business\u2013Competitive Advantages.\u201d\n\n\n61\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nMerger with GS MMLC\n\n\nOn October 12, 2020, we completed our merger (the \u201cMerger\u201d) with GS MMLC pursuant to the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d), dated as of June 11, 2020. As a result of the Merger, we issued an aggregate of 61,037,311 shares of Common Stock to former GS MMLC stockholders. For more information, see Note 13 \u201cMerger with GS MMLC\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\n\nImpact of COVID-19 Pandemic\n\n\nInfection rates in many parts of the world spiked toward the end of 2021 and into early 2022, as the highly transmissible Omicron variant emerged in the fourth quarter and spread rapidly, while the Delta variant also remained a concern.  The surge of infections has led to a renewed emphasis globally on safety measures and restrictions, as well as a greater sense of urgency regarding the distribution of vaccine and vaccine boosters, and has created a greater degree of uncertainty regarding the prospects for economic growth in 2022.\n\n\nOur investment portfolio continues to be focused on industries and sectors that are generally expected to be more durable than industries and sectors that are more prone to economic cycles. Given the unprecedented nature of COVID-19 and the difficulty in predicting future government responses and restrictions, the operating environment of our portfolio companies is evolving rapidly.  Business disruption experienced by our portfolio companies may reduce, over time, the amount of interest and dividend income that we receive from our investments companies and may require us to contribute additional capital to such portfolio companies. We may need to restructure our investments in some portfolio companies, which could result in reduced interest payments from or permanent impairments of our investments, and could result in the restructuring of certain of our investments from income paying investments into non-income paying equity investments. Any such decrease in our net investment income would increase the percentage of our cash flows dedicated to our debt obligations and distribution payments to our stockholders. As a result, we may be required to reduce the future amount of distributions to our stockholders.  While the global economy continued on the path to recovery during 2021, it is vulnerable to the risk that the Omicron variant, or other possible variants, could impede the recovery going forward by precipitating adverse economic consequences, and we continue to closely monitor our exposures to industries that would be most negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nGoldman Sachs has continued to successfully execute on its Business Continuity Planning (the \u201cBCP\u201d) strategy since initially activating it in the first quarter of 2020 in response to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Goldman Sachs\u2019 priority has been to safeguard its employees and to seek to ensure continuity of business operations. Goldman Sachs has a central team that continues to manage its COVID-19 response, which is led by its chief administrative officer and chief medical officer. Goldman Sachs remains focused on ensuring that its employees are able to safely work from their offices, where circumstances permit. During 2021, Goldman Sachs made substantial progress in facilitating the safe return of its employees to their offices and its employees in a number of their locations around the world returned to the office to varying degrees. Given that the situation regarding COVID-19 is fluid and varies geographically, Goldman Sachs\u2019s approach to transitioning back to the office is flexible and evolves as the specific conditions and requirements of each location change.  For instance, in light of the rapid spread of the Omicron variant late in 2021, Goldman Sachs took the step of having the vast majority of its employees in the U.S., U.K. and in some of their other locations work remotely at the outset of 2022.\n \n\n\nFor further information about the risks associated with COVID-19, see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\n\n\nKEY COMPONENTS OF OPERATIONS\n \n\n\nInvestments\n \n\n\nOur level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment, the amount of capital we have available to us and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make.\n \n\n\nAs a BDC, we may not acquire any assets other than \u201cqualifying assets\u201d specified in the Investment Company Act, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in \u201celigible portfolio companies.\u201d Pursuant to rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d), \u201celigible portfolio companies\u201d include certain companies that do not have any securities listed on a national securities exchange and public companies whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange but whose market capitalization is less than $250 million.\n \n\n\nRevenues\n \n\n\nWe generate revenues in the form of interest income on debt investments and, to a lesser extent, capital gains and distributions, if any, on equity securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Some of our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or payment-in-kind (\u201cPIK\u201d) income. The principal amount of the debt investments and any accrued but unpaid interest generally becomes due at the maturity date.\n \n\n\nWe generate revenues primarily through receipt of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, structuring, syndication, exit fees or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. Portfolio company fees (directors\u2019 fees, consulting fees, administrative fees, tax advisory fees and other similar compensation) will be paid to us, unless, to the extent required by applicable law or exemptive relief, if any, therefrom, we receive our allocable portion of such fees when invested in the same portfolio company as other Accounts, which other Accounts could receive their allocable portion of such fee. We\n \n\n\n62\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\ndo not expect to receive material fee income as it is not our principal investment strategy. We record contractual prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income.\n \n\n\nDividend income on preferred equity investments is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies and on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Interest and dividend income are presented net of withholding tax, if any.\n \n\n\nExpenses\n \n\n\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of the Management Fee and the Incentive Fee to our Investment Adviser, legal and professional fees, interest and other debt expenses and other operating and overhead related expenses. The Management Fee and Incentive Fee compensate our Investment Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our investments. We bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions in accordance with the investment management agreement (the \u201cInvestment Management Agreement\u201d) and administration agreement (\u201cAdministration Agreement\u201d), including:\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nour operational expenses; \n\n\n\u2022\nfees and expenses, including travel expenses, incurred by our Investment Adviser or payable to third parties related to our investments, including, among others, professional fees (including the fees of consultants and experts) and fees and expenses from evaluating, monitoring, researching and performing due diligence on investments and prospective investments; \n\n\n\u2022\ninterest payable on debt, if any, incurred to finance our investments; \n\n\n\u2022\nfees and expenses incurred by us in connection with membership in investment company organizations; \n\n\n\u2022\nbrokers\u2019 commissions; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe expenses of and fees for registering or qualifying our shares for sale and of maintaining our registration and registering us as a broker or a dealer; \n\n\n\u2022\nfees and expenses associated with calculating our NAV (including expenses of any independent valuation firm); \n\n\n\u2022\nlegal, auditing or accounting expenses; \n\n\n\u2022\ntaxes or governmental fees; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe fees and expenses of our administrator, transfer agent or sub-transfer agent; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe cost of preparing stock certificates, including clerical expenses of issue, redemption or repurchase of our shares; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe fees and expenses of our directors who are not affiliated with our Investment Adviser; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe cost of preparing and distributing reports, proxy statements and notices to our stockholders, the SEC and other regulatory authorities; \n\n\n\u2022\ncosts of holding stockholder meetings; \n\n\n\u2022\nlisting fees; \n\n\n\u2022\nthe fees or disbursements of custodians of our assets, including expenses incurred in the performance of any obligations enumerated by our certificate of incorporation or bylaws insofar as they govern agreements with any such custodian; \n\n\n\u2022\ninsurance premiums; and \n\n\n\u2022\ncosts incurred in connection with any claim, litigation, arbitration, mediation, government investigation or dispute in connection with our business and the amount of any judgment or settlement paid in connection therewith, or the enforcement of our rights against any person and indemnification or contribution expenses payable by us to any person and other extraordinary expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of our business. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to increase during periods of asset declines. Costs relating to future offerings of securities would be incremental.\n \n\n\nLeverage\n \n\n\nOur senior secured revolving credit agreement (as amended, the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d) with Truist Bank, as administrative agent, and Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, our 4.50% Convertible Notes due 2022 (the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d), our 3.75% Notes due 2025 (the \u201c2025 Notes\u201d), and our 2.875% Notes due 2026 (the \u201c2026 Notes\u201d) allow us to borrow money and lever our investment portfolio, subject to the limitations of the Investment Company Act, with the objective of increasing our yield. This is known as \u201cleverage\u201d and could increase\n \n\n\n63\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nor decrease returns to our stockholders. The use of leverage involves significant risks. We are permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the Investment Company Act, is at least 150% after such borrowing (if certain requirements are met).\n \n\n\nCertain trading practices and investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements, may be considered borrowings or involve leverage and thus may be subject to Investment Company Act restrictions. In accordance with applicable SEC staff guidance and interpretations, when we engage in such transactions, instead of maintaining an asset coverage ratio of at least 150% (if certain requirements are met), we may segregate or earmark liquid assets, or enter into an offsetting position, in an amount at least equal to our exposure, on a mark-to-market basis, to such transactions (as calculated pursuant to requirements of the SEC). Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered borrowings for these purposes. Practices and investments that may involve leverage but are not considered borrowings are not subject to the Investment Company Act\u2019s asset coverage requirement, and we will not otherwise segregate or earmark liquid assets or enter into offsetting positions for such transactions. The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on our Investment Adviser\u2019s and our Board of Directors\u2019 assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY\n \n\n\nOur portfolio (excluding investments in money market funds, if any) consisted of the following:\n

To calculate net debt, we include debt that is both senior and pari passu to the tranche of debt owned by us but exclude debt that is legally and contractually subordinated in ranking to the debt owned by us. We believe this calculation method assists in describing the risk of our portfolio investments, as it takes into consideration contractual rights of repayment of the tranche of debt owned by us relative to other senior and junior creditors of a portfolio company. We typically calculate cash flow available for debt service at a portfolio company by taking EBITDA for the trailing twelve-month period. Weighted average net debt to EBITDA is weighted based on the fair value of our debt investments and excluding investments where net debt to EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, such as cash collateralized loans and investments that are underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue.\nFor a particular portfolio company, we also calculate the level of contractual interest expense owed by the portfolio company, and compare that amount to EBITDA (\u201cinterest coverage ratio\u201d). We believe this calculation method assists in describing the risk of our portfolio investments, as it takes into consideration contractual interest obligations of the portfolio company. Weighted average interest coverage is weighted based on the fair value of our performing debt investments, excluding investments where interest coverage may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, such as cash collateralized loans and investments that are underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue.\nMedian EBITDA is based on our debt investments, excluding investments where net debt to EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, such as cash collateralized loans and investments that are underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue.\nPortfolio company statistics are derived from the most recently available financial statements of each portfolio company as of the reported end date. Statistics of the portfolio companies have not been independently verified by us and may reflect a normalized or adjusted amount. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, investments where net debt to EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk represented 40.3% and 33.1%, of total debt investments.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Investment Adviser monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company on an ongoing basis to determine if it is meeting its respective business plan and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. Our Investment Adviser has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include (i) assessment of success in adhering to the portfolio company\u2019s business plan and compliance with covenants; (ii) periodic or regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; (iii) comparisons to our other portfolio companies in the industry, if any; (iv) attendance at and participation in board meetings or presentations by portfolio companies; and (v) review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections of portfolio companies.\n \n\n\nAs part of the monitoring process, our Investment Adviser also employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Investment Adviser grades the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 4 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (e.g., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company\u2019s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. The grading system for our investments is as follows:\n \n\n\n\u2022\nGrade 1\n investments involve the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company or a potential exit; \n\n\n\u2022\nGrade 2\n investments involve a level of risk to our initial cost basis that is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. This portfolio company is generally performing as expected and the risk factors to our ability to ultimately recoup the cost of our investment are neutral to favorable. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a grade of 2; \n\n\n\u2022\nGrade 3\n investments indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has increased materially since origination or acquisition, including as a result of factors such as declining performance and non-compliance with debt covenants; however, payments are generally not more than 120 days past due; and \n\n\n65\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u2022\nGrade 4\n investments indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has substantially increased since origination or acquisition, and the portfolio company likely has materially declining performance. For debt investments with an investment grade of 4, in most cases, most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. For investments graded 4, it is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of our initial cost basis upon exit. \n\n\nOur Investment Adviser grades the investments in our portfolio at least quarterly and it is possible that the grade of a portfolio investment may be reduced or increased over time. For investments graded 3 or 4, our Investment Adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company. The following table shows the composition of our portfolio on the 1 to 4 grading scale:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs of\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDecember 31, 2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDecember 31, 2020\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestment Performance Rating\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFair Value\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPercentage \nof Total\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFair Value\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPercentage \nof Total\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(in millions)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(in millions)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade 1\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n64.15\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade 2\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3,301.85\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n94.9\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2,822.45\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n87.0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade 3\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n115.24\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3.3\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n353.16\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n10.9\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade 4\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n61.35\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1.8\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3.01\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Investments\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,478.44\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n100.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,242.77\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n100.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe decrease in investments with a grade 1 investment performance rating was driven by the repayment of investments with an aggregate fair value of $64.15 million.

Accrued interest or dividends generally are reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Interest or dividend payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management\u2019s judgment. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest or dividends are paid and, in management\u2019s judgment, principal and interest or dividend payments are likely to remain current. We may make exceptions to this treatment if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\n \n\n\n66\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nThe following table shows our investment activity by investment type\n(1)\n:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n($ in millions)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmount of investments committed at cost:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Lien/Senior Secured Debt\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,841.45\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n507.09\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Lien/Last-Out Unitranche\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n31.14\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n9.01\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Lien/Senior Secured Debt\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n29.13\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1.45\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreferred Stock\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n39.19\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.04\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon Stock\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n9.45\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarrants\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1.85\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,952.21\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n517.59\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProceeds from investments sold or repaid:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Lien/Senior Secured Debt\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,209.87\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n260.04\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Lien/Last-Out Unitranche\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n14.52\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.47\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Lien/Senior Secured Debt\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n209.10\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n59.30\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnsecured Debt\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n7.04\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreferred Stock\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n34.44\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n15.40\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon Stock\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n31.40\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,499.33\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n342.25\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet increase (decrease) in portfolio\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n452.88\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n175.34\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of new portfolio companies with new investment commitments\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n33\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n23\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal new investment commitment amount in new portfolio companies\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,211.54\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n406.48\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage new investment commitment amount in new portfolio companies\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n36.71\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n17.67\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of existing portfolio companies with new investment commitments\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n37\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n10\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal new investment commitment amount in existing portfolio companies\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n740.67\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n111.11\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeighted average remaining term for new investment commitments (in years)\n(2)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5.2\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5.3\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of new debt investment commitments at cost for floating interest rates\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n100.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n100.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of new debt investment commitments at cost for fixed interest rates\n(3)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2014%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2014%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeighted average yield on new debt and income producing investment commitments\n(4)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n7.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n8.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeighted average yield on new investment commitments\n(5)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n7.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n8.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeighted average yield on debt and income producing investments sold or repaid\n(6)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n7.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n7.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeighted average yield on investments sold or repaid\n(7)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n7.2\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n7.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(1)\nFigures for new investment commitments are shown net of capitalized fees, expenses and original issue discount (\u201cOID\u201d) that occurred at the initial close.

The Merger was accounted for as an asset acquisition in accordance with ASC 805-50, Business Combinations \u2014 Related Issues. The consideration paid to GS MMLC\u2019s stockholders was less than the aggregate fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which resulted in a purchase discount (the \u201cpurchase discount\u201d). The purchase discount was allocated to the cost of GS MMLC investments acquired by us on a pro-rata basis based on their relative fair values as of the closing date. Immediately following the Merger with GS MMLC, we marked the investments to their respective fair values and, as a result, the purchase discount allocated to the cost basis of the investments acquired was immediately recognized as unrealized appreciation on our Consolidated Statement of Operations.  The purchase discount allocated to the loan investments acquired will amortize over the life of each respective loan through interest income with a corresponding adjustment recorded as unrealized depreciation on such loans acquired through their ultimate disposition. The purchase discount allocated to equity investments acquired will not amortize over the life of such investments through interest income and, assuming no subsequent change to the fair value of the equity investments acquired and disposition of such equity investments at fair value, we will recognize a realized gain with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation on disposition of such equity investments acquired.\n\n\nAs a supplement to our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP, we have provided, as detailed below, certain non-GAAP financial measures to our operating results that exclude the aforementioned purchase discount and the ongoing amortization thereof, as determined in accordance with GAAP.  The non-GAAP financial measures include (i) Adjusted net investment income after taxes; (ii) Adjusted net realized and unrealized gains (losses); and iii) Adjusted net increase in net assets from operations.  We believe that the adjustment to exclude the full effect of the purchase discount is meaningful because it is a measure that we and investors use to assess our financial condition and results of operations.  Although these non-GAAP financial measures are intended to enhance investors\u2019 understanding of our business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. The aforementioned non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(in millions)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet investment income after taxes\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n237.38\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n109.90\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLess: Purchase discount amortization\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n42.45\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n10.11\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted net investment income after taxes\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n194.93\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n99.79\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet realized and unrealized gains (losses)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n(44.59\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n66.22\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLess:  Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) due to the purchase discount\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(42.85\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n73.41\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLess:  Realized gain (loss) due to the purchase discount\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.40\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.44\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted net realized and unrealized gains (losses)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n(2.14\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n(7.63\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet increase in net assets from operations\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n192.43\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n176.11\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLess:  Purchase discount amortization\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n42.45\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n10.11\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLess:  Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) due to the discount\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(42.85\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n73.41\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLess:  Realized gain (loss) due to the purchase discount\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.40\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.44\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted net increase in net assets from operations\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n192.43\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n92.15\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n68\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nInvestment Income\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(in millions)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n326.03\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n162.77\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDividend income\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1.00\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.20\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPayment-in-kind\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n16.08\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n7.60\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther income\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3.87\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2.39\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Investment Income\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n346.98\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n172.96\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the table above:\n\n\n\u2022\nInterest income from investments increased from $162.77 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $326.03 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

In August 2021, we fully exited our preferred and common stock investments in CB-HDT Holdings, Inc. (dba Hunter Defense Technologies), which resulted in a realized gain of $35.92 million. In February 2021, we fully exited our common stock investment in Wrike, Inc., which resulted in a realized gain of $7.54 million.\n \n\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net realized losses were primarily driven by our investments in four portfolio companies. In August 2020, our first lien debt investment, preferred and common equity in Animal Supply Holdings, LLC was exchanged for second lien debt, common equity and a right to purchase additional first lien debt, second lien debt and common equity, which resulted in a realized loss of $35.98 million. In March 2020, there was a restructure of our second lien debt investment in MPI Products LLC (\u201cMPI\u201d), which resulted in a realized loss of $5.58 million. The private equity sponsor that purchased MPI provided it with new capital and we received newly issued second lien debt and non-interest bearing second lien debt. Also in March 2020, our second lien debt investment in Bolttech Mannings, Inc. was exchanged for common equity, which resulted in a realized loss of $4.70 million. In October 2020, we sold our preferred stock in Accuity Delivery Systems, LLC, which resulted in a realized gain of $3.76 million.\n\n\nAny changes in fair value are recorded as a change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments.

Generally, our investments continued to improve from the impact by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Businesses continued to navigate governmental mandates and the government continued to maintain liquidity in the capital markets and provide fiscal stimulus to support the economy. Given the unprecedented nature of COVID-19, the operating environment of our portfolio companies is evolving rapidly.  For further discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our portfolio, please see \u201c\u2014Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic.\u201d In addition, the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) was driven by the financial improvement of CB-HDT Holdings, Inc. and Zep Inc..\n\n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n \n\n\nThe primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for our investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to our stockholders or for other general corporate purposes, including paying for operating expenses or debt service to the extent we borrow or issue senior securities.\n \n\n\nWe expect to generate cash primarily from the net proceeds of any future offerings of securities, future borrowings and cash flows from operations. To the extent we determine that additional capital would allow us to take advantage of additional investment opportunities, if the market for debt financing presents attractively priced debt financing opportunities, or if our Board of Directors otherwise determines that leveraging our portfolio would be in our best interest and the best interests of our stockholders, we may enter into credit facilities in addition to our existing credit facilities as discussed below, or issue other senior securities. We would expect any such credit facilities may be secured by certain of our assets and may contain advance rates based upon pledged collateral. The pricing and other terms of any such facilities would depend upon market conditions when we enter into any such facilities as well as the performance of our business, among other factors. As a BDC, with certain limited exceptions, we are only permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the Investment Company Act, is at least 150% after such borrowing (if certain requirements are met). See \u201c\u2014Key Components of Operations\u2014Leverage.\u201d As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, our asset coverage ratio based on the aggregate amount outstanding of our senior securities was 186% and 198%. We may also refinance or repay any of our indebtedness at any time based on our financial condition and market conditions.\n \n\n\nWe may enter into investment commitments through signed commitment letters which may ultimately become investment transactions in the future. We regularly evaluate and carefully consider our unfunded commitments using GSAM\u2019s proprietary risk management framework for the purpose of planning our capital resources and ongoing liquidity, including our financial leverage.\n \n\n\nEquity Issuances\n \n\n\nThere were no equity issuances of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2021. On October 12, 2020, in connection with the Merger, we issued an aggregate of 61,037,311 shares of Common Stock to former GS MMLC stockholders.\n \n\n\nCommon Stock Repurchase Plans\n \n\n\nIn February 2019, our Board of Directors approved a 10b5-1 plan (the \u201c2019 10b5-1 Plan\u201d), which provided for us to repurchase of up to $25.00 million of shares of our common stock if the stock traded below the most recently announced NAV per share, subject to limitations. The 2019 10b5-1 Plan took effect on March 18, 2019, was temporarily suspended on December 9, 2019 and expired on March 18, 2020. We did not repurchase any of our common stock pursuant to the 2019 10b5-1 Plan or otherwise.\n\n\nIn November 2020, our Board of Directors authorized the adoption of a new common stock repurchase plan (the \u201c2020 10b5-1 Plan\u201d), which provided for us to repurchase up to $75.00 million of shares of our common stock if the stock trades below the most recently announced quarter-end NAV per share, subject to limitations. The 2020 10b5-1 Plan was adopted and took effect on November 9, 2020.  The 2020 10b5-1 Plan expired on November 9, 2021. We did not repurchase any of our common stock pursuant to the 2020 10b5-1 Plan or otherwise.\n \n\n\nDividend Reinvestment Plan\n \n\n\nWe have a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of all cash distributions declared by our Board of Directors unless a stockholder elects to \u201copt out\u201d of the plan. As a result, if our Board of Directors declares a cash distribution, then the stockholders who have not \u201copted out\u201d of the dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution. Due to regulatory considerations, Group Inc. has opted out of the dividend reinvestment plan, and GS & Co. has opted out of the dividend reinvestment plan in respect of any shares of our common stock acquired through any 10b5-1 plan we may adopt. For further details, see Note 9 \u201cNet Assets\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n \n\n\nContractual Obligations\n \n\n\nWe have entered into certain contracts under which we have future commitments. Payments under the Investment Management Agreement, pursuant to which GSAM has agreed to serve as our Investment Adviser, are equal to (1) a percentage of value of our average gross assets and (2) a two-part Incentive Fee. Under the Administration Agreement, pursuant to which State Street Bank and Trust Company has agreed to furnish us with the administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations, we pay our administrator such fees as may be agreed between us and our administrator that we determine are commercially reasonable in our sole discretion. Either party or the stockholders, by a\n \n\n\n71\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nvote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, may terminate the Investment Management Agreement without penalty on at least 60 days\u2019 written notice to the other party.

Debt outstanding denominated in currencies other than USD has been converted to USD using the applicable foreign currency exchange rate as of the applicable reporting date. As of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding borrowings denominated in USD of $799.57 million, in Euros (EUR) of 37.70 million, in British Pounds (GBP) of 11.90 million and Canadian Dollar (CAD) of 0.15 million.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRevolving Credit Facility\n \n\n\nOn September 19, 2013, we entered into a Revolving Credit Facility with various lenders. Truist Bank serves as administrative agent and Bank of America N.A. serves as syndication agent under the Revolving Credit Facility. We amended and restated the Revolving Credit Facility on October 3, 2014, November 3, 2015, December 16, 2016, February 21, 2018, September 17, 2018, February 25, 2020, November 20, 2020 and August 13, 2021.\n \n\n\nThe aggregate committed borrowing amount under the Revolving Credit Facility is $1,695.00 million. The Revolving Credit Facility includes an uncommitted accordion feature that allows us, under certain circumstances, to increase the borrowing capacity of the Revolving Credit Facility to up to $2,250.00 million.\n \n\n\nBorrowings denominated in USD, including amounts drawn in respect of letters of credit, bear interest (at our election) of either (i) LIBOR plus a margin of either (x) 2.00%, (y) 1.875%  (subject to maintenance of certain long-term corporate debt ratings) or (z) 1.75% (subject to certain borrowing base conditions) or (ii) an alternative base rate, which is the highest of 0%, the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50% and overnight LIBOR plus 1.00%, plus a margin of either (x) 1.00%, (y) 0.875% (subject to maintenance of certain long-term corporate debt ratings) or (z) 0.75% (subject to certain borrowing base conditions). Borrowings denominated in non-USD bear interest of LIBOR plus a margin of either 2.00%, 1.875% or 1.75% (subject to the conditions applicable to borrowings denominated in USD that bear interest based on LIBOR) plus, in the case of borrowings denominated in GBP only, an additional 0.1193% credit adjustment spread. With respect to borrowings denominated in USD, we may elect either LIBOR, or an alternative base rate at the time of borrowing, and such borrowings may be converted from one benchmark to another at any time, subject to certain conditions. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears. We pay a fee of 0.375% per annum on committed but undrawn amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility, payable quarterly in arrears. Any amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility will mature, and all accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable, on August 13, 2026.\n \n\n\nFor further details, see Note 6 \u201cDebt \u2013 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nConvertible Notes\n \n\n\nOn October 3, 2016, we closed an offering of $115.00 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured Convertible Notes, which included $15.00 million aggregate principal amount issued pursuant to the initial purchasers\u2019 exercise in full of an over-allotment option (the \u201cInitial Convertible Notes\u201d). On July 2, 2018, we closed an offering of $40.00 million aggregate additional principal amount (the \u201cAdditional Convertible Notes\u201d and, together with the Initial Convertible Notes, the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d). The Additional Convertible Notes have identical terms, are fungible and are part of the Initial Convertible Notes.\n \n\n\nThe Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing on April 1, 2017. The Convertible Notes will mature on April 1, 2022, unless repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date.

To the extent that any of our loans are denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, we may enter into currency hedging contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We may also enter into interest rate hedging agreements. Such hedging activities, which will be subject to compliance with applicable legal requirements, may include the use of futures, options, swaps and forward contracts. Costs incurred in entering into such contracts or in settling them, if any, will be borne by us. Our Investment Adviser has claimed no-action relief from CFTC registration and regulation as a commodity pool operator pursuant to a CFTC Rule 4.5 with respect to our operations, with the result that we will be limited in our ability to use futures contracts or options on futures contracts or engage in swap transactions. Specifically, CFTC Rule 4.5 imposes strict limitations on using such derivatives other than for hedging purposes, whereby the use of derivatives not used solely for hedging purposes is generally limited to situations where (i) the aggregate initial margin and premiums required to establish such positions does not exceed five percent of the liquidation value of our portfolio, after taking into account unrealized profits and unrealized losses on any such contracts it has entered into; or (ii) the aggregate net notional value of such derivatives does not exceed 100% of the liquidation value of our portfolio. Moreover, we anticipate entering into transactions involving such derivatives to a very limited extent solely for hedging purposes or otherwise within the limitations of CFTC Rule 4.5.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\n \n\n\nOn December 14, 2021, Brendan McGovern notified us of his intention to retire from his position as Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company effective on or about March 7, 2022, or such earlier date as our board directors may determine. Mr. McGovern\u2019s retirement is not the result of any disagreement with us. On December 16, 2021, our Board of Directors appointed Alex Chi and David Miller as co-Chief Executive Officers and co-Presidents, effective on or about March 7, 2022, or such earlier date as our Board of Directors may determine.\n \n\n\nOn February 23, 2022, Jon Yoder resigned as Chief Operating Officer of the Company, effective March 7, 2022. Mr. Yoder also resigned as Chief Operating Officer of GS PMMC, GS PMMC II, and GS MMLC II, in each case effective March 7, 2022. Mr. Yoder\u2019s resignation is not the result of any disagreement with the Company. On February 23, 2022, our Board of Directors appointed Gabriella N. Skirnick as Chief Operating Officer of the Company, effective on March 7, 2022.\n\n\nOn February 23, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly distribution of $0.45 per share payable on April 27, 2022 to holders of record as of March 31, 2022.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n73\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n \n\n\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ materially.\n \n\n\nFor a description of our critical accounting policies, see Note 2 \u201cSignificant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.  We consider the most significant accounting policies to be those related to our Valuation of Portfolio Investments, Revenue Recognition, Non-Accrual Investments, Distribution Policy, and Income Taxes.\n\n", "item7a": ">ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITA\nT\nIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n \n\n\nWe are subject to financial market risks, most significantly changes in interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we expect to fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is expected to be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income.\n \n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, on a fair value basis, approximately 0.6% and 0.9% of our performing debt investments bore interest at a fixed rate (including income producing preferred stock investments), and approximately 99.4% and 99.1% of our performing debt investments bore interest at a floating rate. Our borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a floating rate and our Convertible Notes, 2025 Notes and 2026 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate.\n \n\n\nWe regularly measure our exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities.\n \n\n\nBased on our December 31, 2021 balance sheet, the following table shows the annual impact on net income of base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments) assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure:\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021\nBasis Point Change\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInterest\nIncome\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInterest\nExpense\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNet\nIncome\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(in millions)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUp 300 basis points\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n60.22\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n(23.90\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n36.32\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUp 200 basis points\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n32.90\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(15.93\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n16.97\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUp 100 basis points\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5.93\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(7.97\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(2.04\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUp 75 basis points\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.98\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(5.97\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(4.99\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUp 50 basis points\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.30\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(3.98\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(3.68\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUp 25 basis points\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.15\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(1.99\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(1.84\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDown 25 basis points\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(0.09\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.81\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.72\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDown 50 basis points\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(0.10\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.81\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.71\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDown 75 basis points\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(0.10\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.81\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.71\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDown 100 basis points\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(0.11\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.81\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.70\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDown 200 basis points\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(0.11\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.81\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.70\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDown 300 basis points\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(0.11\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.81\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.70\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe may, in the future, hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act, applicable CFTC regulations and in a manner consistent with SEC guidance.
