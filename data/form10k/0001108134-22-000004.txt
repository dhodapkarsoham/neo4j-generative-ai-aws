(\u201cBerkshire\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d) is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. Berkshire is a Delaware corporation and the holding company for Berkshire Bank (\u201cthe Bank\u201d).\nBerkshire Bank\n is transforming what it means to bank its neighbors socially, humanly, and digitally to empower the financial potential of people, families, and businesses in its communities as it pursues its vision of being the leading socially responsible omni-channel community bank in the markets it serves. Berkshire Bank provides business and consumer banking, mortgage, wealth management, and investment services. \nAt year-end 2021, the Bank had 106 full-service banking offices in its New England and New York footprint.\n \nDuring 2021, the Company opened commercial banking offices in New Haven, CT and Providence, RI. During the year 2021, the Company sold its 8 Mid-Atlantic banking offices and related operations, while maintaining a commercial lending office with an asset-based lending focus.\n \nAlso during the year, the Bank consolidated 16 branch offices in its New England/New York footprint. and sold its insurance operations.\n \nThe emergence of the global COVID-19 pandemic in the first quarter of 2020 affected many aspects of the Company\u2019s operations and financial condition through 2020 and 2021, as further described in other sections of this report.\n \nThe Company\u2019s markets were initially among the hardest hit areas in the world.\n \nBeginning in the first \n4\nTable of Contents\nquarter of 2021, the Company\u2019s markets were among the leading areas of the country in achieving high rates of vaccination with new vaccines that were deployed.\n \nFILINGS\nInformation regarding the Company is available through the Investor Relations tab at berkshirebank.com. The Company\u2019s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports filed pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge at sec.gov and, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with the Securities and Exchange Commission, at berkshirebank.com under the Investor Relations tab. Information on the website is not incorporated by reference and is not a part of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nCOMPETITION\nThe Company is subject to strong competition from banks and other financial institutions and financial service providers. Its competition includes national and super-regional banks. Non-bank competitors include credit unions, brokerage firms, insurance providers, financial planners, and the mutual fund industry. New technology is reshaping customer interaction with financial service providers and the increase of internet-accessible financial institutions increases competition for the Company\u2019s customers. The Company generally competes on the basis of customer service, relationship management, and the fair pricing of its products.\n \nThe location and convenience of branch offices is also a significant competitive factor, particularly regarding new offices. The Company is pursuing a \u201cbanker heavy, branch light\u201d model in newer markets, and uses its mobile MyBanker teams which provide personalized service to customers with committed relationships.\n \nThe Company does not rely on any individual, group, or entity for a material portion of its deposits.\n \nDue to recent mergers of in-market bank competitors, the Company is pursuing opportunities to expand its market share and talent recruitment.\nLENDING ACTIVITIES\nGeneral.\n The Bank originates loans in the four basic portfolio categories discussed below. Lending activities are limited by federal and state laws and regulations. Loan interest rates and other key loan terms are affected principally by the Bank\u2019s credit policy, asset/liability strategy, loan demand, competition, and the supply of money available for lending purposes. These factors, in turn, are affected by general and economic conditions, monetary policies of the federal government, including the Federal Reserve, legislative tax policies, and governmental budgetary matters. Most of the Bank\u2019s loans held for investment are made in its market areas and are secured by real estate located in its market areas. Lending is therefore affected by activity in these real estate markets. The Bank monitors and manages the amount of long-term fixed-rate lending volume. Adjustable-rate loan products generally reduce interest rate risk but may produce higher loan losses in the event of sustained rate increases. The Bank generally originates loans for investment except for residential mortgages, which are generally originated for sale on a servicing released basis. Additionally, the Bank also originates Small Business Administration (\"SBA\") 7A loans for sale to investors. The Bank also conducts wholesale purchases and sales of loans and loan participations generally with other banks doing business in its markets, including selected national banks.\n \nThe information discussed below describes the Company\u2019s ongoing lending activities.\n \nThe COVID-19 pandemic conditions that affected the Company\u2019s activities in 2021 and 2020 are discussed in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis in Item 7 of this report.\n5\nTable of Contents\nLoan Portfolio Analysis.\n The following table sets forth the year-end composition of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio in dollar amounts and as a percentage of the portfolio at the dates indicated.\u00a0Further information about the composition of the loan portfolio is contained in Note 7 - Loans of the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nItem 1 - Table 1 - Loan Portfolio Analysis\n2021\n2020\n2019\n(In\u00a0millions)\nAmount \nPercent of Total \nAmount\nPercent of Total\nAmount\nPercent of Total\nLoans:\nConstruction\n$\n324\u00a0\n4.7\u00a0\n%\n$\n455\u00a0\n5.6\u00a0\n%\n$\n449\u00a0\n4.7\u00a0\n%\nCommercial multifamily\n516\u00a0\n7.6\u00a0\n483\u00a0\n6.0\u00a0\n632\u00a0\n6.7\u00a0\nCommercial real estate owner occupied\n607\u00a0\n8.9\u00a0\n552\u00a0\n6.8\u00a0\n673\u00a0\n7.1\u00a0\nCommercial real estate non-owner occupied\n2,157\u00a0\n31.6\u00a0\n2,119\u00a0\n26.2\u00a0\n2,190\u00a0\n23.0\u00a0\nCommercial and industrial\n1,285\u00a0\n18.8\u00a0\n1,943\u00a0\n24.0\u00a0\n1,844\u00a0\n19.4\u00a0\nResidential real estate\n1,489\u00a0\n21.8\u00a0\n1,932\u00a0\n23.9\u00a0\n2,853\u00a0\n30.0\u00a0\nHome equity\n252\u00a0\n3.7\u00a0\n294\u00a0\n3.7\u00a0\n379\u00a0\n4.0\u00a0\nConsumer other\n196\u00a0\n2.9\u00a0\n303\u00a0\n3.8\u00a0\n483\u00a0\n5.1\u00a0\nTotal\n$\n6,826\u00a0\n100.0\u00a0\n%\n$\n8,081\u00a0\n100.0\u00a0\n%\n$\n9,503\u00a0\n100.0\u00a0\n%\nAllowance for credit losses \n(1)\n(106)\n(127)\n(64)\nNet loans\n$\n6,720\u00a0\n$\n7,954\u00a0\n$\n9,439\u00a0\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Beginning January 1, 2020, the allowance calculation is based on current expected loss methodology. Prior to January 1, 2020, the allowance calculation was based on the incurred loss model.\nCommercial Real Estate.\n The Bank originates commercial real estate loans on properties used for business purposes such as small office buildings, industrial, healthcare, lodging, recreation, or retail facilities. Commercial real estate loans are provided on owner-occupied properties and on investor-owned properties. The portfolio includes commercial 1-4 family and multifamily properties. Loans may generally be made with amortizations of up to 30 years and with interest rates that adjust periodically (primarily from short-term to five years). Most commercial real estate loans are originated with final maturities of 10 years or less. As part of its business activities, the Bank also enters into commercial loan participations.\nCommercial real estate loans are among the largest of the Bank\u2019s loans, and may have higher credit risk and lending spreads. Because repayment is often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties, repayment of commercial real estate loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. The Bank seeks to manage these risks through its underwriting disciplines and portfolio management processes. The Bank generally requires that borrowers have debt service coverage ratios (the ratio of available cash flows before debt service to debt service) of at least 1.25 times based on stabilized cash flows of leases in place, with some exceptions for national credit tenants. For variable rate loans, the Bank underwrites debt service coverage to interest rate shocks of 300 basis points or higher based on a minimum of 1.0 times coverage and it uses loan maturities to manage risk based on the lease base and interest sensitivity. Loans at origination may be made up to 80% of appraised value based on property type and risk, with sublimits of 75% or less for designated specialty property types. Generally, commercial real estate loans are supported by full or partial personal guarantees by the principals. Credit enhancements in the form of additional collateral or guarantees are normally considered for start-up businesses without a qualifying cash flow history.\nThe Bank offers interest rate swaps to certain larger commercial mortgage borrowers. These swaps allow the Bank to originate a mortgage based on short-term published interest rates and allow the borrower to swap into a longer-term fixed rate. The Bank simultaneously sells an offsetting back-to-back swap to an investment grade national bank so that it does not retain this fixed-rate risk. The Bank also records fee income on these interest rate swaps based on the terms of the offsetting swaps with the bank counterparties.\nThe Bank originates construction loans to developers and commercial borrowers in and around its markets. The maximum loan to value limits for construction loans follow Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") supervisory limits, up to a maximum of 85 percent. The Bank commits to provide the permanent mortgage \n6\nTable of Contents\nfinancing on most of its construction loans on income-producing property. Advances on construction loans are made in accordance with a schedule reflecting the cost of the improvements. Construction loans include land acquisition loans up to a maximum 50 percent loan to value on raw land. Construction loans may have greater credit risk due to the dependence on completion of construction and other real estate improvements, as well as the sale or rental of the improved property. The Bank generally mitigates these risks with presale or preleasing requirements and phasing of construction.\n\u00a0\nCommercial and Industrial Loans (\"C&I\").\n C&I loans are mostly managed through the Bank\u2019s commercial middle market banking organization. The Bank offers secured commercial term loans with repayment terms which are normally limited to the expected useful life of the asset being financed, and generally not exceeding ten years. The Bank also offers revolving loans, lines of credit, letters of credit, time notes and SBA guaranteed loans. Business lines of credit have adjustable rates of interest and can be committed or are payable on demand, subject to annual review and renewal. Commercial and industrial loans are generally secured by a variety of collateral such as accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, and are generally supported by personal guarantees. Loan-to-value ratios depend on the collateral type and generally do not exceed 80 percent of orderly liquidation value. Some commercial loans may also be secured by liens on real estate. The Bank generally does not make unsecured commercial loans. Commercial loans are of higher risk and are made primarily on the basis of the borrower\u2019s ability to make repayment from the cash flows of its business. Further, any collateral securing such loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to monitor and appraise and may fluctuate in value. The Bank gives additional consideration to the borrower\u2019s credit history and the guarantor\u2019s capacity to help mitigate these risks. Additionally, the Bank uses loan structures including shorter terms, amortizations, and advance rate limitations to additionally mitigate credit risk. The Company considers these loans, together with its owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, as constituting the primary relationship based component of its commercial lending activities. The loans originated through the Company\u2019s participation in the SBA\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) lending program in 2020 were classified as C&I loans.\n \nThis program was an integral component of federal support programs in response to the emergence of the pandemic in the first half of 2020. These loans were viewed as zero credit risk due to the related SBA guarantee. Most of these loans were repaid via SBA forgiveness in 2021.\n \nThe balance of these PPP loans was $30 million at year-end 2021, compared to $633 million at year-end 2020.\n \nAsset Based Lending. \nThe Asset Based Lending Group serves the commercial middle market in New England, as well as the Bank\u2019s market in northeastern New York and in the Mid-Atlantic. The group expands the Bank\u2019s business lending offerings to include revolving lines of credit and term loans secured by accounts receivable, inventory, and other assets to manufacturers, distributors and select service companies experiencing seasonal working capital needs, rapid sales growth, a turnaround, buyout or recapitalization with credit needs generally ranging from $2 to $25 million. Asset based lending involves monitoring loan collateral so that outstanding balances are always properly secured by business assets, which reduces the risks associated with these loans.\nSmall Business Banking. \nThis group is also referred to as Business Banking, and handles most business relationships which are smaller than the middle market category. Additionally, some smaller business needs are handled through the Bank\u2019s retail branch system. Berkshire Bank also owns 44 Business Capital, a dedicated SBA 7A program lending team based in the Philadelphia area. This team originates loans in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and nationally. 44 Business Capital also works with business banking and small business teams to provide SBA guaranteed loans to business Banking Customers in Berkshire\u2019s footprint. This team sells the guaranteed portions of these loans with servicing retained and the Bank retains the unguaranteed portions of the loans in its C&I loan portfolio. The Bank is a preferred SBA lender and closely manages the servicing portfolio pursuant to SBA requirements. This team is the Bank\u2019s largest source of commercial lending fee revenue, and it is targeting to further expand these operations. Berkshire Bank also owns Firestone Financial Corp. (\"Firestone\"), which is located in Needham, MA. Firestone originates loans secured by business-essential equipment through over 160 equipment distributors and manufacturers and directly via the end borrower in all 50 states. Key customer segments include the fitness, carnival, gaming, and entertainment industries.\nResidential Mortgages.\n Through its mortgage banking operations, the Bank offers fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans to individuals with maturities of up to 30 years that are fully amortizing with monthly loan payments. The majority of loans are originated for sale with rate lock commitments which are recorded as \n7\nTable of Contents\nderivative financial instruments. Mortgages are generally underwritten according to U.S. government sponsored enterprise guidelines designated as \u201cA\u201d or \u201cA-\u201d and referred to as \u201cconforming loans\u201d. The Bank also originates jumbo loans above conforming loan amounts which generally are consistent with secondary market guidelines for these loans and are often held in portfolio. The Bank does not offer subprime mortgage lending programs. The Bank buys and sells seasoned mortgages primarily with smaller financial institutions operating in its markets.\n \nThe Bank is developing conduit relationships in its markets as an additional business channel for newly originated mortgages.\nThe majority of the Bank\u2019s secondary marketing is to U.S. secondary market investors on a servicing-released basis. The Bank also sells directly to government sponsored enterprises with servicing retained. Mortgage sales generally involve customary representations and warranties and are nonrecourse in the event of borrower default. The Bank is also an approved originator of loans for sale to the Federal Housing Administration (\u201cFHA\u201d), U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d), state housing agency programs, and other government sponsored mortgage programs.\nThe Bank does not offer interest-only or negative amortization mortgage loans. Adjustable rate mortgage loan interest rates may rise as interest rates rise, thereby increasing the potential for default. The Bank also originates construction loans which generally provide 15-month construction periods followed by a permanent mortgage loan, and follow the Bank\u2019s normal mortgage underwriting guidelines. Mortgage banking also requires flexible and scalable operations due to the volatility of mortgage demand over time. Investor management is integral to maintaining the secondary market support that is required for these operations.\n \nIn 2021, the Bank entered into a third party relationship to service the residential mortgages and real estate secured consumer loans in its portfolio.\nConsumer Loans. \nThe Bank\u2019s consumer loans are centrally underwritten and processed by its experienced consumer lending team based in Syracuse, New York. The Bank\u2019s primary consumer lending activity in recent years was indirect auto lending. In 2019, the Company decided to end the origination of indirect auto loans.\n \nThe Bank\u2019s other major consumer lending activity is prime home equity lending, following its conforming mortgage underwriting guidelines with more streamlined verifications and documentation. Most of these outstanding loans are prime based home equity lines with a maximum combined loan-to-value of 85 percent. Home equity line credit risks include the risk that higher interest rates will affect repayment and possible compression of collateral coverage on second lien home equity lines.\n \nIn 2021, the Company expanded its consumer lending in its markets through a third party relationship with a financial technology company which originates unsecured consumer loans through the internet using artificial intelligence technology in combination with the Bank\u2019s underwriting criteria.\nMaturity and Sensitivity of Loan Portfolio.\n The following table shows contractual final maturities of loans at year-end 2021. The contractual maturities do not reflect premiums, discounts, deferred costs, or prepayments.\n\u00a0\nItem 1 - Table 2A - Loan Contractual Maturity - Scheduled loan amortizations are not included in the maturities presented.\nContractual\u00a0Maturity\nOne\u00a0Year\nOne to\nFive to \nMore\u00a0Than\n\u00a0\n(In\u00a0thousands)\nor\u00a0Less\nFive\u00a0Years\nFifteen Years\nFifteen\u00a0Years\nTotal\nLoans:\nConstruction\n$\n80,052\u00a0\n$\n142,114\u00a0\n$\n87,478\u00a0\n$\n14,638\u00a0\n$\n324,282\u00a0\nCommercial multifamily\n39,899\u00a0\n177,740\u00a0\n293,666\u00a0\n4,512\u00a0\n515,817\u00a0\nCommercial real estate owner occupied\n45,827\u00a0\n173,858\u00a0\n316,684\u00a0\n70,108\u00a0\n606,477\u00a0\nCommercial real estate non-owner occupied\n280,160\u00a0\n1,049,631\u00a0\n748,396\u00a0\n78,742\u00a0\n2,156,929\u00a0\nCommercial and industrial\n303,706\u00a0\n683,365\u00a0\n274,324\u00a0\n23,034\u00a0\n1,284,429\u00a0\nResidential real estate\n3,430\u00a0\n33,530\u00a0\n233,909\u00a0\n1,218,379\u00a0\n1,489,248\u00a0\nHome equity\n1,388\u00a0\n4,195\u00a0\n65,897\u00a0\n180,886\u00a0\n252,366\u00a0\nConsumer other\n9,396\u00a0\n133,138\u00a0\n44,001\u00a0\n9,764\u00a0\n196,299\u00a0\nTotal\n$\n763,858\u00a0\n$\n2,397,571\u00a0\n$\n2,064,355\u00a0\n$\n1,600,063\u00a0\n$\n6,825,847\u00a0\n\u00a0\n8\nTable of Contents\nItem 1 - Table 2B - Total loans due after one year as of December 31, 2021 - fixed and variable interest rates\n(In\u00a0thousands)\nFixed Interest Rate \nVariable Interest Rate\nTotal\nLoans:\nConstruction\n$\n28,215\u00a0\n$\n216,015\u00a0\n$\n244,230\u00a0\nCommercial multifamily\n115,278\u00a0\n360,640\u00a0\n475,918\u00a0\nCommercial real estate owner occupied\n199,055\u00a0\n361,595\u00a0\n560,650\u00a0\nCommercial real estate non-owner occupied\n581,824\u00a0\n1,294,945\u00a0\n1,876,769\u00a0\nCommercial and industrial\n356,189\u00a0\n624,534\u00a0\n980,723\u00a0\nResidential real estate\n1,148,983\u00a0\n336,835\u00a0\n1,485,818\u00a0\nHome equity\n2,045\u00a0\n248,933\u00a0\n250,978\u00a0\nConsumer other\n180,932\u00a0\n5,971\u00a0\n186,903\u00a0\nTotal\n$\n2,612,521\u00a0\n$\n3,449,468\u00a0\n$\n6,061,989\u00a0\nLoan Administration. \nLending activities are governed by a loan policy approved by the Board\u2019s Risk Management and Capital Committee. Internal staff perform and monitor post-closing loan documentation review, quality control, and commercial loan administration. The lending staff assigns a risk rating to all commercial loans, excluding point scored small business loans. Management primarily relies on internal risk management staff to review the risk ratings of the majority of commercial loan balances.\nThe Bank\u2019s lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by the Risk Management and Capital Committee and Management, under the leadership of the Chief Risk Officer. The Bank\u2019s loan underwriting is based on a review of certain factors including risk ratings, recourse, loan-to-value ratios, and material policy exceptions. The Risk Management and Capital Committee has established individual and combined loan limits and lending approval authorities. Management\u2019s Executive Loan Committee is responsible for commercial loan approvals in accordance with these standards and procedures. Generally, pass rated secured commercial loans can be approved jointly up to $7 million by the business line Managing Director and Credit Director. Loans up to $10 million can be approved with the additional signature of the Chief Credit Officer. Loans in excess of this amount, and designated lower rated loans are approved by the Executive Loan Committee. \n \nThe Bank tracks loan underwriting exceptions and exception reports are actively monitored by executive lending management.\nThe Bank\u2019s lending activities are conducted by its salaried and commissioned loan personnel. Designated salaried branch staff originate conforming residential mortgages and receive bonuses based on overall performance. Additionally, the Bank employs commissioned residential mortgage originators. Commercial lenders receive salaries and are eligible for bonuses based on individual and overall performance. The Bank purchases whole loans and participations in loans from banks headquartered in its market and from outside of its market. These loans are underwritten according to the Bank\u2019s underwriting criteria and procedures and are generally serviced by the originating lender under terms of the applicable agreement. The Bank routinely sells newly originated, fixed-rate residential mortgages in the secondary market. Customer rate locks are offered without charge and rate locked applications are generally committed for forward sale or hedged with derivative financial instruments to minimize interest rate risk pending delivery of the loans to the investors. The Bank also sells interest rate derivatives to larger commercial borrowers desiring to fix their interest rates, and includes these derivatives in its underwriting and administrative procedures.\n \nThe Bank also sells residential mortgages and commercial loan participations on a non-recourse basis. The Bank issues loan commitments to its prospective borrowers conditioned on the occurrence of certain events. Loan origination commitments are made in writing on specified terms and conditions and are generally honored for up to 60 days from approval; some commercial commitments are made for longer terms. The Company also monitors pipelines of loan applications and has processes for issuing letters of interest for commercial loans and pre-approvals for residential mortgages, all of which are generally conditional on completion of underwriting prior to the issuance of formal commitments.\n9\nTable of Contents\nThe loan policy sets certain limits on concentrations of credit and requires periodic reporting of concentrations to the Risk Management and Capital Committee. The Bank has heightened monitoring of its 25 largest borrower relationships. Commercial real estate is generally managed within federal regulatory monitoring guidelines of 300% of risk based capital for non-owner occupied commercial real estate and 100% for construction loans. The Bank has hold limits for numerous categories of commercial specialty lending including healthcare, hospitality, designated franchises, and leasing, as well as hold limits for designated commercial loan participations purchased. In most cases, these limits are below 100% of risk based capital for all outstanding loans in each monitored category.\nProblem Assets.\n The Bank prefers to work with borrowers to resolve problems rather than proceeding to foreclosure. For commercial loans, this may result in a period of forbearance or restructuring of the loan, which is normally done at current market terms and does not result in a \u201ctroubled\u201d loan designation. For residential mortgage loans, the Bank generally follows FDIC guidelines to attempt a restructuring that will enable owner-occupants to remain in their home. However, if these processes fail to result in a performing loan, then the Bank generally will initiate foreclosure or other proceedings no later than the 90th day of a delinquency, as necessary, to minimize any potential loss. Management reports delinquent loans and non-performing assets to the Board quarterly. Loans are generally removed from accruing status when they reach 90 days delinquent, except for certain loans which are well secured and in the process of collection. Loan collections are managed by a combination of the related business units and the Bank\u2019s special assets group, which focuses on larger, riskier collections and the recovery of purchased credit deteriorated loans.\nReal estate obtained by the Bank as a result of loan collections, including foreclosures, is classified as real estate owned until sold. When property is acquired it is recorded at fair market value less estimated selling costs at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Holding costs and decreases in fair value after acquisition are expensed. Interest income on accruing troubled debt restructurings totaled $0.2\u00a0million for 2021. The total carrying value of troubled debt restructurings was $26.8\u00a0million at year-end.\nAsset Classification and Delinquencies. \nThe Bank performs an internal analysis of its commercial loan portfolio and assets to classify such loans and assets in a manner similar to that employed by federal banking regulators. There are four classifications for loans with higher than normal risk: Loss, Doubtful, Substandard, and Special Mention. Usually an asset classified as Loss is fully charged-off. Substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values questionable, and there is a high possibility of loss. Assets that do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories, but possess weaknesses, are designated Special Mention. Please see the additional discussion of non-accruing and potential problem loans in Item 7 and additional information in notes to the financial statements.\n \nImpaired loans acquired in business combinations are normally rated Substandard or lower and the fair value assigned to such loans at acquisition includes a component for the possibility of loss if deficiencies are not corrected.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Loans.\n The Bank\u2019s loan portfolio is regularly reviewed by management to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Prior to 2020, the allowance represented management\u2019s estimate of inherent incurred losses that are probable and estimable as of the date of the financial statements. The allowance included a specific component for impaired loans (a \u201cspecific loan loss reserve\u201d) and a general component for portfolios of all outstanding loans (a \u201cgeneral loan loss reserve\u201d). At the time of acquisition, no allowance for loan losses was assigned to loans acquired in business combinations. These loans were initially recorded at fair value, including the impact of expected losses, as of the acquisition date. An allowance on such loans was established subsequent to the acquisition date through the provision for loan losses based on an analysis of factors including environmental factors.  \nOn January 1, 2020, the Company adopted the new loan loss allowance standard based on Current Expected Credit losses (\u201cCECL\u201d). Under this standard, management makes estimates of future economic conditions over the life of the loan portfolio and other future conditions and arrives at a reasonable estimate of expected loan losses. The basis \n10\nTable of Contents\nof the allowance changed from an incurred model to an expected model based on this standard. As a result, the amount of the loan loss allowance and the loan loss provision beginning in 2020 is not comparable to prior years. Also, since different banks may use different estimates and arrive at different expectations, comparisons between banks are more difficult. Further, since the accounting is based on future projections our estimates may change significantly from period to period, the amounts of the allowance and provision may be more volatile than under the previous model. Further information about the allowance is discussed further in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nManagement believes that it uses the best information available to establish the allowance. However, future adjustments to the allowance for credit losses on loans may be necessary, and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making its determinations. There can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loan or loan portfolio category deteriorate. Regulatory agencies may require the Bank to make additional provisions for credit losses based upon judgments different from those of management. Any material increase in the allowance may adversely affect the Bank\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nItem 1 - Table 3 - Credit Quality Ratios\n2021\n2020\n2019\nRatios:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAllowance for credit losses/total loans\n1.55\u00a0\n%\n1.58\u00a0\n%\n0.67\u00a0\n%\nNon-accrual loans/total loans\n0.52\u00a0\n0.80\u00a0\n0.42\u00a0\nAllowance for credit losses/non-accruing loans\n300.33\u00a0\n196.01\u00a0\n160.38\u00a0\nNet charge-offs/average loans\n0.29\u00a0\n0.41\u00a0\n0.35\u00a0\nItem 1 - Table 3.a - Net charge-offs to average loans  for each loan category\n2021\n2020\n2019\nNet charge-offs to average loans:\nConstruction\n\u2014\u00a0\n%\n0.01\u00a0\n%\n\u2014\u00a0\n%\nCommercial multifamily\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n0.01\u00a0\nCommercial real estate owner occupied\n0.02\u00a0\n0.08\u00a0\n0.05\u00a0\nCommercial real estate non-owner occupied\n0.18\u00a0\n0.12\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\nCommercial and industrial\n0.09\u00a0\n0.16\u00a0\n0.24\u00a0\nResidential real estate\n\u2014\u00a0\n0.01\u00a0\n0.01\u00a0\nHome equity\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n0.01\u00a0\nConsumer other\n0.01\u00a0\n0.02\u00a0\n0.03\u00a0\n11\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables present year-end data for the approximate allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan categories at the dates indicated (including an apportionment of any unallocated amount).\u00a0The first table shows for each category the amount of the allowance allocated to that category as a percentage of the outstanding loans in that category.\u00a0The second table shows the allocated allowance together with the percentage of loans in each category to total loans.\u00a0Management believes that the allowance can be allocated by category only on an approximate basis.

The portfolio is also used to manage interest rate risk and to earn a reasonable return on investment. Decisions are made in accordance with the Company\u2019s investment policy and include consideration of risk, return, duration, and portfolio concentrations. Day-to-day oversight of the portfolio rests with the Chief Financial Officer and the Treasurer. The Enterprise Risk Management/Asset-Liability Committee meets multiple times each quarter and reviews investment strategies. The Risk Management and Capital Committee of the Board of Directors provides general oversight of the investment function.\nHistorically, the Company has maintained short-term investment balances as a component of cash and cash equivalents which are a component of short-term liquidity management.\n \nDue to the pandemic, with a surge in demand deposits and a reduction in loan balances, the balance of short-term investments has increased due to the comparatively low yields and spreads on longer duration investment securities.\n \nMost short-term investments have been maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.\nThe Company has historically maintained a high-quality portfolio of managed duration mortgage-backed securities, together with a portfolio of municipal bonds including national and local issuers and local economic development bonds issued to non-profit organizations. Nearly all of the mortgage-backed securities are issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac, consisting principally of collateralized mortgage obligations (generally consisting of planned amortization class bonds and pass-through securities). The municipal portfolio provides tax-advantaged yield, and the local economic development bonds were originated by the Company to area borrowers. The Company invests in investment grade corporate bonds and Agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Purchases of non-investment grade fixed-income securities have consisted primarily of capital instruments issued by local and regional financial institutions. The Company also invests in funds financing community reinvestment projects. The Bank owns restricted equity in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (\u201cFHLBB\u201d) based on its operating relationship with the FHLBB. \n \nThe Company has various hold limits limiting credit and instrument exposures.\nThe Company owns an interest rate swap against a tax advantaged economic development bond issued to a local not-for-profit organization, and as a result this security is carried as a trading account security. The Company generally designates debt securities as available for sale, but sometimes designates longer-duration municipal and other securities as held to maturity based on its intent. This also allows the Company to more effectively manage the potential impact of longer-duration, fixed-rate securities on stockholders' equity in the event of rising interest rates.\nThe following table summarizes year-end 2021 amortized cost, weighted average yields, and contractual maturities of debt securities. Yields are shown on a fully taxable equivalent basis and are based on amortized cost. A significant portion of the mortgage-based securities are planned amortization class bonds.\u00a0Their expected durations are 3-5 years at current interest rates, but the contractual maturities shown reflect the underlying maturities of the collateral mortgages.\u00a0Additionally, the mortgage-based securities maturities shown below are based on final maturities and do not include scheduled amortization. Yields include amortization and accretion of premiums and discounts. There were no material changes in the tax-exempt portfolio.\nItem 1 - Table 5 - Weighted Average Yield\n\u00a0\nOne\u00a0Year\u00a0or\u00a0Less\nMore\u00a0than\u00a0One\nYear\u00a0to\u00a0Five\u00a0Years\nMore\u00a0than\u00a0Five\u00a0Years\nto\u00a0Ten\u00a0Years\nMore\u00a0than\u00a0Ten\u00a0Years\nTotal\n(In\u00a0millions)\nAmortized\nCost\nWeighted\nAverage\nYield\nAmortized\nCost\nWeighted\nAverage\nYield\nAmortized\nCost\nWeighted\nAverage\nYield\nAmortized\nCost\nWeighted\nAverage\nYield\nAmortized\nCost\nWeighted\nAverage\nYield\nMunicipal bonds and obligations\n$\n2.1\u00a0\n3.0\u00a0\n%\n$\n5.5\u00a0\n5.0\u00a0\n%\n$\n36.5\u00a0\n5.0\u00a0\n%\n$\n309.2\u00a0\n4.0\u00a0\n%\n$\n353.3\u00a0\n4.0\u00a0\n%\nMortgage-backed securities\n0.1\u00a0\n2.0\u00a0\n%\n31.8\u00a0\n2.0\u00a0\n%\n255.4\u00a0\n2.0\u00a0\n%\n1,752.8\u00a0\n1.0\u00a0\n%\n2,040.1\u00a0\n2.0\u00a0\n%\nOther bonds and obligations\n61.0\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n%\n1.7\u00a0\n2.0\u00a0\n%\n40.1\u00a0\n4.0\u00a0\n%\n22.3\u00a0\n3.0\u00a0\n%\n125.1\u00a0\n2.0\u00a0\n%\nTotal\n$\n63.2\u00a0\n0.3\u00a0\n%\n$\n39.0\u00a0\n2.7\u00a0\n%\n$\n332.0\u00a0\n2.4\u00a0\n%\n$\n2,084.3\u00a0\n1.9\u00a0\n%\n$\n2,518.5\u00a0\n1.9\u00a0\n%\nDEPOSIT ACTIVITIES AND OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDS\nDeposits are the major source of funds for the Bank\u2019s lending and investment activities. Deposit accounts are the primary product and service interaction with the Bank\u2019s customers. The Bank serves personal, commercial, non-profit, and municipal deposit customers. Most of the Bank\u2019s deposits are generated from the areas surrounding its branch offices. The Bank offers a wide variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms. The Bank also periodically offers promotional interest rates and terms for limited periods of time. The Bank\u2019s deposit accounts consist of demand deposits (non-interest-bearing checking), NOW (interest-bearing checking), regular savings, money market savings, and time certificates of deposit. The Bank emphasizes its transaction deposits \n\u2013\n checking and NOW accounts \n\u2013\n for personal accounts and checking accounts promoted to businesses. These accounts have the lowest marginal cost to the Bank and are also often a core account for a customer relationship. The Bank offers a courtesy overdraft program to improve customer service, and also provides debit cards and other electronic fee producing payment services to transaction account customers. The Bank offers targeted online and mobile deposit account opening capabilities for personal accounts. The Bank promotes remote deposit capture devices so that commercial accounts can make deposits from their place of business. Additionally, the Bank offers a variety of retirement deposit accounts to personal and business customers. Deposit related fees are a significant source of fee income to the Bank, including overdraft and interchange fees related to debit card usage. Deposit service fee income also includes other miscellaneous transactions and convenience services sold to customers through the branch system as part of an overall service relationship. The Bank offers compensating balance arrangements for larger business customers as an alternative to fees charged for checking account services. Berkshire\u2019s Business Connection is a personal financial services benefit package designed for the employees of its business customers. In addition to providing service through its branches, Berkshire provides services to deposit customers through its private bankers, MyBankers, commercial/small business relationship managers, and call center representatives. Commercial cash management services are an important commercial service offered to commercial \n \nand governmental depositors and a fee income source to the bank. The Bank also operates a commercial payment processing business that serves regional and national payroll service bureau customers. Online banking and mobile banking functionality is increasingly important as a component of deposit account access and service delivery. The Bank is also gradually deploying its MyTeller video tellers to complement and extend its service capabilities in its branches.\n \nThe Bank has partnered with a third party fintech company to provide enhanced online deposit account opening services. The Company also is monitoring the development of payment services which are growing in their importance in the personal and commercial deposit markets. \n13\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents information concerning average balances and weighted average interest rates on the Bank\u2019s interest-bearing deposit accounts for the years indicated. \nItem 1 - Table 6 - Average Balance and Weighted Average Rates for Deposits\n\u00a0\n2021\n2020\n2019\n(In\u00a0millions)\nAverage\nBalance\nPercent\nof\u00a0Total\nAverage\nDeposits\nWeighted\nAverage\nRate\nAverage\nBalance\nPercent\nof\u00a0Total\nAverage\nDeposits\nWeighted\nAverage\nRate\nAverage\nBalance\nPercent\nof\u00a0Total\nAverage\nDeposits\nWeighted\nAverage\nRate\nDemand\n$\n3,008.5\u00a0\n30\u00a0\n%\n\u2014\u00a0\n%\n$\n2,324.6\u00a0\n23\u00a0\n%\n\u2014\u00a0\n%\n$\n1,745.2\u00a0\n18\u00a0\n%\n\u2014\u00a0\n%\nNOW and other\n976.4\u00a0\n10\u00a0\n0.1\u00a0\n1,216.6\u00a0\n12\u00a0\n0.3\u00a0\n1,053.9\u00a0\n11\u00a0\n0.6\u00a0\nMoney market\n3,293.5\u00a0\n32\u00a0\n0.2\u00a0\n2,713.6\u00a0\n26\u00a0\n0.6\u00a0\n2,542.6\u00a0\n26\u00a0\n1.2\u00a0\nSavings\n1,111.6\u00a0\n11\u00a0\n0.1\u00a0\n914.1\u00a0\n9\u00a0\n0.1\u00a0\n798.2\u00a0\n8\u00a0\n0.2\u00a0\nTime\n1,678.9\u00a0\n17\u00a0\n0.9\u00a0\n3,102.9\u00a0\n30\u00a0\n1.7\u00a0\n3,754.2\u00a0\n37\u00a0\n2.0\u00a0\nTotal\n$\n10,068.9\u00a0\n100\u00a0\n%\n0.3\u00a0\n%\n$\n10,271.8\u00a0\n100\u00a0\n%\n0.7\u00a0\n%\n$\n9,894.1\u00a0\n100\u00a0\n%\n1.2\u00a0\n%\nEstimated uninsured deposits were $3.7 billion and $4.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The Bank utilizes brokered time deposits to broaden its funding base, augment its interest rate risk management vehicles, and to support loan growth. The Bank also offers brokered reciprocal money market arrangements to provide additional deposit protection to certain large commercial and institutional accounts. These balances are viewed as part of overall relationship balances with regional customers. Brokered deposits are sourced through selected Board approved brokers; these deposits are viewed as potentially more volatile than other deposits and are managed as a component of the Bank's liquidity policies.\nThe Company also uses borrowings from the FHLBB as an additional source of funding, particularly for daily cash management and for funding longer duration assets. FHLBB advances also provide more pricing and option alternatives for particular asset/liability needs. The FHLBB functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for member institutions. As an FHLBB member, the Company is required to own capital stock of the organization. Borrowings from this institution are secured by a blanket lien on most of the Bank\u2019s mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities, as well as certain other assets. Advances are made under several different credit programs with different lending standards, interest rates, and range of maturities.  The Bank also has access to borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.\nThe Company had a $15 million trust preferred obligation and a $7 million trust preferred obligation outstanding, as well as $74 million in senior subordinated notes at year-end 2021. The Company\u2019s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker \u201cBHLB\u201d. Subject to certain limitations, the Company can also choose \n14\nTable of Contents\nto issue common stock, preferred stock, subordinated debt, or senior debt in public stock offerings or private placements. In 2020, the Company renewed its universal securities shelf registration with the SEC to facilitate potential future capital issuances. The Company has maintained a shelf registration as part of its routine capital management for many years. \n \nDERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe Company offers interest rate swaps to commercial loan customers who wish to fix the interest rates on their loans, and the Company backs these swaps with offsetting swaps with national bank counterparties. With other lending institutions, the Company engages in risk participation agreements. These arrangements are structured similarly to its swaps with commercial borrowers, but a different bank is the lead underwriter. The Company gets paid a fee to take on the risk associated with having to make the lead bank whole on Berkshire\u2019s portion of the pro-rated swap should the borrower default. These swaps are designated as economic hedges. Interest rate swaps that meet certain criteria to be viewed as conforming are required to be cleared through exchanges. The Bank has designated a national financial institution as its clearing agent.\nThe Company\u2019s mortgage banking activities result in derivatives. Commitments to lend are provided on applications for residential mortgages intended for resale and are accounted for as non-hedging derivatives. The Company arranges offsetting forward sales commitments for most of these rate-locks with national bank counterparties, which are designated as economic hedges. Commitments on applications intended to be held for investment are not accounted for as derivative financial instruments. The Company has a policy for managing its derivative financial instruments, and the policy and program activity are overseen by the Risk Management and Capital Committee. Derivative financial instruments with counterparties which are not customers are limited to a select number of national financial institutions. Collateral may be required based on financial condition tests. The Company works with third-party firms which assist in marketing derivative transactions, executing transactions, and providing information for bookkeeping and accounting purposes.\nThe Company sometimes uses interest rate swap instruments for its own account to fix the interest rate on some of its borrowings, all of which have been designated as cash flow hedges. The Company also has begun offering forward foreign exchange derivatives to its commercial markets as part of its expanded international banking services. The Company expects to back these forwards with offsetting forwards with national bank counterparties. This activity would be targeted to support routine commercial needs of customers engaged in international trading activities and would only be offered for bank approved currencies and durations.\nLIBOR BASED INSTRUMENTS\nThe Company\u2019s floating-rate funding, certain hedging transactions and certain of the Company\u2019s products, such as floating-rate loans and mortgages, determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to a benchmark rate using the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). Pursuant to bank regulations, the use of LIBOR as an index for new contracts was prohibited beginning in 2022. The use of LIBOR as an index on existing \u201cLegacy\u201d contracts will be discontinued beginning in 2023. There is further discussion of the LIBOR transition in Item 1A and Item 7 of this report.\n15\nTable of Contents\nWEALTH MANAGEMENT SERVICES\nThe Company\u2019s Wealth Management Group provides consultative investment management, trust administration, and financial planning to individuals, businesses, and institutions, with an emphasis on personal investment management. The Wealth Management Group has built a track record over more than a decade with its dedicated in-house investment management team. The Bank also provides a full line of investment products, financial planning, and brokerage services through BerkshireBanc Investment Services utilizing Commonwealth Financial Network as the broker/dealer. The Bank is integrating with its growing private banking and MyBanker teams to further develop wealth management account generation. The Wealth Management Group reported $1.7 billion in total assets under management at year-end 2021. The Company expanded this team during the year and introduced Socially Responsible Investment portfolios as another element of the Company\u2019s overall vision of being a leading socially responsible company. \nHUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nBerkshire\u2019s people are the core of its ability to deliver on its Berkshire\u2019s Exciting Strategic Transformation (BEST) plan and vision of being a high performing, leading socially responsible community bank in New England and beyond.\n \nThe Company\u2019s approach to human capital management is grounded in its Be FIRST values and focuses on: \n\u2022\nStrong oversight and risk management practices\n\u2022\nRecruitment \n\u2022\nCompensation & Benefits \n\u2022\nRetention, Training, Development & Engagement \n\u2022\nHealth & Wellness\nOversight\nThe Board of Directors has ultimate responsibility for the strategy of the Company. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors oversees executive compensation matters and the Corporate Responsibility & Culture committee oversees company culture, diversity, and employee engagement. The Company proactively identifies potential human capital related risks, such as the labor market shortage, rising labor costs, and employee retention and designs strategies to mitigate those risks. Strong human capital management is viewed as integral to the Company's strategic transformation. \nRecruitment\nBerkshire operates in a highly competitive labor market with strong competition for top talent. To help power Berkshire\u2019s transformation, it relies on and continues to recruit employees with the right mix of skills, expertise and experiences. The Company leverages several strategies to support its talent pipeline and talent acquisition activities including internship placements, affinity group relationships, and the use of experienced recruiters for key management and specialized positions. Berkshire continues to pursue a hybrid work model to expand its access to top talent and provide its employees with workplace flexibility. These strategies have proved effective in meeting the demand for talent demonstrated by the Company\u2019s strong track record attracting new talent across retail, commercial, wealth management, business banking and operational areas. In addition, as market disruptions from mergers remain, Berkshire will continue to leverage its differentiated brand and unique market positioning to hire community-focused bankers from its competitors. \nCompensation & Benefits \nWhile the labor market shortage and other factors can contribute to increased labor costs, Berkshire continually evaluates its strategies and looks at best practices to provide competitive pay and benefits packages that reward performance and retain top talent at all levels of the Company. The Company offers comprehensive medical coverage, paid vacation and personal time, along with other benefits, all of which are available to married same-sex or different-sex couples as well as domestic partners. In addition to its compensation and health benefits, Berkshire offers volunteer-time off, an employee assistance program, regular performance reviews and the You FIRST Fund to help employees impacted by personal financial hardships. \n16\nTable of Contents\nRetention, Training, Development & Engagement \nStrong employee retention will help reduce expense, create efficiencies and contribute to the success of BEST. In addition to compensation and benefits packages, Berkshire employs a collection of strategies to strengthen employee retention. The Company offers a menu of development and training programs consistent with one\u2019s job responsibilities and professional goals including a mentoring program to pair high potential junior employees with senior staff. Berkshire continues to reskill and upskill employees from across the Company to take on new responsibilities and roles. For employees looking to expand their professional experience in the classroom, the Company offers an education assistance program. In 2021, Berkshire further enhanced its commitment to creating a strong workplace culture by rolling out a comprehensive employee engagement survey to identify strengthens and opportunity areas within the organization. Action plans were developed in areas that did not meet the Company\u2019s high expectations. It expects to continue to enhance its efforts through intentional actions including offering a new employee rewards and recognition program. \nHealth & Wellness\nLike all businesses, Berkshire has been impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and continues to proactively manage impacts to protect the health and safety of its employees, customers and communities as well as retain and attract top talent.\n \nDuring the height of the pandemic, the Company provided protective equipment to front-line employees, including masks and gloves, and offered all additional paid sick time, paid vaccine time, paid quarantine/isolation leave, job protected personal leave, flexible work schedules for remote employees, premium pay for onsite employees and maintained full pay for employees with reduced schedules, as a result of the pandemic. The Company continues to maintain a largely hybrid working environment with the majority of non-branch staff working remotely at least part-time. \nFuture of the Workplace\nBerkshire continues to evolve and enhance its human capital management strategies to help drive organizational growth in support of BEST while combating risks, such as the labor market shortage and rising labor costs. The Company intends to continue to evolve its workplace model into a hybrid environment over the long-term. It also plans to pursue its DigiTouch\u2122 service delivery model, a powerful combination of personal service driven by bankers fused with the convenience of user-centric technology that combined, delivers a superior customer experience. While technology will play a bigger role in the future of Berkshire helping to improve processes and drive efficiencies, people will always be at the core of its ability to deliver value to its customers and communities. The Company remains confident that the Berkshire brand, value proposition and socially-responsible vision will continue to be a differentiator in the market and help overcome labor market disruptions. \nHuman Capital*\n\u25e6\nTotal Full Time Equivalent\n1319\n\u25e6\nTurnover Rate\n31%\n\u25e6\nRetention Rate\n64%\n*All metrics reported are as of or for the year-ended December 31, 2021. \nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion \nCreating a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace is a critical component to the success of Berkshire\u2019s Exciting Strategic Transformation (BEST) and its BEST Community Comeback. At the core of Berkshire\u2019s strategy is a goal to ensure that its workforce reflects the communities in which it operates, that its employees feel that they are valued and can reach their full potential and that it leverages its core business to improve the access and affordability of financial solutions to support economic growth of under-represented populations and communities. \nThe Company instituted a strong foundation of governance practices to ensure that diversity, equity and inclusion is embedded into Berkshire\u2019s business activities. This includes the Corporate Responsibility & Culture Committee of the Board of Directors which has ultimate oversight responsibility. Berkshire\u2019s Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Committee, which reports into the Board committee, provides additional management level oversight to the Company\u2019s programming and performance. To further strengthen those efforts in 2021, Berkshire named a Senior Vice President/Chief Diversity Officer.\n \n17\nTable of Contents\nThe Company continues to work to improve representation within its workplace leveraging a combination of strategies. Berkshire identifies opportunities in targeted markets and business lines, develops deeper partnerships with non-profit organizations and affinity groups and uses external recruitment professionals to ensure it receives candidate pools that reflect the rural and urban communities in which it operates. In addition, the Company regularly reviews the gender and ethnic diversity of its workforce at the employee, manager and executive management level. \nDiversity & Inclusion*\n\u25e6\nPercent of women in workforce \n67\u00a0\n%\n\u25e6\nPercent of ethnic minorities in workforce \n15\u00a0\n%\n\u25e6\nPercent of women on the Board\n25\u00a0\n%\n\u25e6\nPercent of ethnic minorities on the Board\n25\u00a0\n%\n\u25e6\nPercent of women in management (officer+)\n20\u00a0\n%\n\u25e6\nPercent of ethnic minorities in management officer+)\n4\u00a0\n%\n*All metrics reported are as of  December 31, 2021.\nBerkshire provides a full suite of diversity, equity & inclusion trainings to build understanding and afford employees with strategies they can put into practice. All employees complete training annually. In addition, Berkshire offers seven Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) each playing an integral role for employees and the culture of the company. Every Employee Resource Group provides a safe space for dialogue, education, and collective action on topics relevant to their members and the Company. Through the ERGs, employees concerns and ideas to strengthen Berkshire\u2019s culture are elevated to members of management and the Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Committee for action, empowering employees to collectively be engines of positive change within the workplace.\n \nAdditional information on Berkshire\u2019s Human Capital Management and Diversity, Equity & Inclusion practices can be found in the Company\u2019s annual \nCorporate Responsibility Report\n, which details the company's environmental, social and governance programs. \nSUBSIDIARY ACTIVITIES\nThe Company wholly-owns Berkshire Bank.\n \nThe Bank operates as a commercial bank under a Massachusetts trust company charter. Berkshire Bank owns Firestone Financial, LLC which is a Massachusetts limited liability company, as well as consolidated subsidiaries operated as Massachusetts securities corporations and other subsidiary entities. The Company also owns all of the common stock of Delaware statutory business trusts, Berkshire Hills Capital Trust I and SI Capital Trust II. The capital trusts are unconsolidated and their only material assets are trust preferred securities related to the junior subordinated debentures reported in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements. Additional information about the subsidiaries is contained in Exhibit 21 to this report.\nREGULATION AND SUPERVISION\nThe Company is a Delaware corporation and a bank holding company that has elected financial holding company status within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. As such, it is registered with, supervised by and required to comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board requires the Company to file various reports and also conducts examinations of the Company. The Company must receive the approval of the Federal Reserve Board to engage in certain transactions, such as acquisitions of additional banks and savings associations, and the Company must seek nonobjection for various capital actions, including stock repurchases.\nThe Bank is a Massachusetts-chartered trust company and its deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. The Bank was previously a Massachusetts-chartered savings bank and converted to a Massachusetts-chartered trust company in July 2014. The Bank is subject to extensive regulation by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks (the \u201cCommissioner\u201d), as its chartering agency, and by the FDIC, as its deposit insurer. The Bank is required to file reports with the Commissioner and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such as mergers \n18\nTable of Contents\nwith, or acquisitions of, other depository institutions or branches of other institutions. \n \nUnder specified conditions, the Bank must also seek regulatory approval of capital distributions to the Company, its sole shareholder.\nThe Commissioner and the FDIC conduct periodic examinations to test the Bank\u2019s safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements. The regulatory structure gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulatory requirements and policies, whether by the Commissioner, the Massachusetts legislature, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board, or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the Company, the Bank, and their operations.\nCertain regulatory requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank are referred to below. The description of statutory provisions and regulations applicable to financial institutions and their holding companies set forth in this Form 10-K does not purport to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Company and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations. A summary of the regulatory requirements referred to below is as follows:\n\u2022Massachusetts Banking Laws and Supervision\n\u2022Federal Regulations\n\u2022Enforcement\n\u2022Holding Company Regulation\n\u2022Mergers and Acquisitions\n\u2022Other Regulations\n\u2022Taxation\nMassachusetts Banking Laws and Supervision\nGeneral.\n As a Massachusetts-chartered depository institution, the Bank is subject to various Massachusetts statutes and regulations which govern, among other things, investment powers, lending and deposit-taking activities, borrowings, maintenance of surplus and reserve accounts, distribution of earnings and payment of dividends. In addition, the Bank is subject to Massachusetts consumer protection and civil rights laws and regulations. The approval of the Commissioner is required for a Massachusetts-chartered institution to establish or close branches, merge with other financial institutions, issue stock, and undertake certain other activities.\nMassachusetts law and regulations generally allow Massachusetts institutions to engage in activities permissible for federally chartered banks or banks chartered by another state. There is a 30-day notice procedure to the Commissioner in order to engage in such activities. Massachusetts law also authorized Massachusetts institutions to engage in activities determined to be \u201cfinancial in nature,\u201d or incidental or complementary to such a financial activity, subject to a 30-day notice to the Commissioner.\nDividends.\n \nUnder Massachusetts law, the Bank may declare cash dividends from net profits not more frequently than quarterly and non-cash dividends at any time. No dividends may be declared, credited, or paid if the institution\u2019s capital stock is impaired. An institution with outstanding preferred stock may not, without the prior approval of the Commissioner, declare dividends to the common stock without also declaring dividends to the preferred stock. The approval of the Commissioner is generally required if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained \u201cnet profits,\u201d as defined, of the preceding two years. The approval of both the Commissioner and the FDIC is required for the Bank to pay a dividend from its surplus account, which was the case during 2021 as to Bank dividends to the Company, and is expected to be the case for 2022.\nLoans to One Borrower Limitations.\n Massachusetts banking law grants broad lending authority. However, with certain limited exceptions, total obligations of one borrower to an institution may not exceed 20.0% of the total of the institution\u2019s capital, which is defined under Massachusetts law as the sum of the institution\u2019s capital stock, surplus account and undivided profits.\nInvestment Activities.\n In general, Massachusetts-chartered institutions may invest in preferred and common stock of any corporation organized under the laws of the United States or any state provided such investments do not involve control of any corporation and do not, in the aggregate, exceed 4.0% of the bank\u2019s deposits. Massachusetts-\n19\nTable of Contents\nchartered institutions may also invest an amount equal to 1.0% of their deposits in stocks of Massachusetts corporations or companies with substantial employment in Massachusetts which have pledged to the Commissioner that such monies will be used for further development within the Commonwealth. However, these powers are constrained by federal law, which generally limit the activities and equity investments of state banks to those permitted for national banks.\nRegulatory Enforcement Authority.\n Any Massachusetts-chartered institution that does not operate in accordance with the regulations, policies, and directives of the Commissioner may be sanctioned for non-compliance, including seizure of the property and business of the institution and suspension or revocation of its charter. The Commissioner may, under certain circumstances, suspend or remove officers or directors who have violated the law, conducted the institution\u2019s business in a manner which is unsafe, unsound or contrary to the depositors\u2019 interests, or been negligent in the performance of their duties. In addition, upon finding that an institution has engaged in an unfair or deceptive act or practice, the Commissioner may issue an order to cease and desist and impose a fine on the institution concerned. Finally, Massachusetts consumer protection and civil rights statutes applicable to the Bank permit private individual and class action lawsuits and provide for the rescission of consumer transactions, including loans, and the recovery of statutory and punitive damage and attorney\u2019s fees in the case of certain violations of those statutes.\nMassachusetts has other statutes or regulations that are similar to the federal provisions discussed below.\nFederal Regulations\nCapital Requirements.\n Federal regulations require FDIC insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8.0%, and a 4.0% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The definitions of these capital categories and the ratio metrics are set out in federal regulations.  In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. \nIn assessing an institution\u2019s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary. As a bank holding company, the Company is also subject to regulatory capital requirements, as described in a subsequent section.\nInterstate Banking and Branching\n.\n Federal law permits an institution, such as the Bank, to acquire another institution by merger in a state other than Massachusetts unless the other state has opted out. Federal law, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, authorizes de novo branching into another state to the extent that the target state allows its state-chartered banks to establish branches within its borders. As of December 31, 2021, the Bank operated branches in New York, Vermont, Connecticut and Rhode Island, as well as Massachusetts.  At its interstate branches, the Bank may conduct any activity authorized under Massachusetts law that is permissible either for an institution chartered in that state (subject to applicable federal restrictions) or a branch in that state of an out-of-state national bank. The New York State Superintendent of Banks, the Vermont Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, the Connecticut Commissioner of Banking and the Director of the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation may exercise certain regulatory authority over the Bank\u2019s branches in their respective states.\nPrompt Corrective Regulatory Action.\n Federal law requires that federal bank regulatory authorities take \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d with respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. At December 31, 2021, the Bank met the criteria for being considered \u201cwell capitalized\u201d as defined in the prompt corrective action regulations.\nThe law establishes three categories of capital deficient institutions: undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. The FDIC regulations implementing the prompt corrective action law were amended to incorporate the previously discussed increased regulatory capital standards that were effective January 1, 2015. An institution is deemed to be \u201cwell capitalized\u201d if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of \n20\nTable of Contents\n6.5% or greater. An institution is \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater, and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is \u201cundercapitalized\u201d if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%, or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be \u201csignificantly undercapitalized\u201d if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%, or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be \u201ccritically undercapitalized\u201d if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%.\n\u201cUndercapitalized\u201d banks must adhere to growth, capital distribution (including dividend), and other limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. A bank\u2019s compliance with such plans must be guaranteed by its holding company in an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the institution\u2019s total assets when deemed \u201cundercapitalized\u201d or the amount needed to comply with regulatory capital requirements. If an \u201cundercapitalized\u201d bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is \u201csignificantly undercapitalized.\u201d \u201cSignificantly undercapitalized\u201d banks must comply with one or more of a number of additional restrictions, including but not limited to an order by the FDIC to sell sufficient voting stock to become \u201cadequately capitalized,\u201d requirements to reduce assets and cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks or dismiss directors or officers, and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers, and capital distributions by the holding company. \u201cCritically undercapitalized\u201d institutions must comply with additional sanctions including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after it obtains such status.\nTransactions with Affiliates and Loans to Insiders.\n Transactions between depository institutions and their affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. In a holding company context, at a minimum, the parent holding company of an institution and any companies which are controlled by the holding company are affiliates of the institution. Generally, Section 23A limits the extent to which the institution or its subsidiaries may engage in \u201ccovered transactions,\u201d such as loans, with any one affiliate to 10% of such institution\u2019s capital stock and surplus. There is also an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to 20% of capital stock and surplus. Loans to affiliates and certain other specified transactions must comply with specified collateralization requirements. Section 23B requires that transactions with affiliates be on terms that are no less favorable to the institution or its subsidiary as similar transactions with non-affiliates.\nFederal law also restricts an institution with respect to loans to directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders (\u201cinsiders\u201d). Loans to insiders and their related interests may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such persons and affiliated entities, the institution\u2019s total capital and surplus. Loans to insiders above specified amounts must receive the prior approval of the Board of Directors. Further, loans to insiders must be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons, except that such insiders may receive preferential loans made under a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to the institution\u2019s employees and does not give preference to the insider over the employees. Federal law places additional limitations on loans to executive officers. Massachusetts law previously had a separate law regarding insider transactions, but that law was amended in 2015 to generally incorporate the federal restrictions.\nInsurance of Deposit Accounts\n.\n The Bank\u2019s deposit accounts are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC up to applicable limits. The FDIC insures deposits up to the standard maximum deposit insurance amount (\u201cSMDIA\u201d) of $250,000.\nThe FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base its assessments upon each insured institution\u2019s total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits.\nUnder the FDIC\u2019s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assessed based on perceived risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund with institutions deemed less risky pay lower FDIC assessments. Assessments for institutions with $10 billion or more of assets are primarily based on a scorecard approach by the FDIC, including factors such as examination ratings and modeling measuring the institution\u2019s ability to withstand asset-related and funding-related stress and potential loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund should the bank fail. The assessment range \n21\nTable of Contents\n(inclusive of possible adjustments specified by the regulations) for institutions with greater than $10 billion of total assets is 1.5 to 40 basis points. \nInsurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by a regulator. Management does not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of FDIC deposit insurance.\nThe FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future.\nFederal Home Loan Bank System\n.\n The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank system, which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks that provide a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. The Bank, as a member, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLBB.\nThe Federal Home Loan Banks are required to provide funds for certain purposes including contributing funds for affordable housing programs. These requirements, and general financial results, could reduce the amount of dividends that the Federal Home Loan Banks pay to their members and result in the Federal Home Loan Banks imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to their members. Historically, the FHLBB has paid dividends to member banks based on money market rates.\nEnforcement\nThe FDIC has primary federal enforcement responsibility over state-chartered banks that are not members of Federal Reserve System, which includes the Bank. The FDIC has authority to bring enforcement actions against such institutions and their \u201cinstitution-related parties,\u201d including officers, directors, certain shareholders, and attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution or receivership or conservatorship in certain circumstances. Potential civil money penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and are adjusted annually for inflation.  Such penalties currently range up to more than $50 thousand per day or, in extreme cases, as high as $2 million per day.\nHolding Company Regulation\nGeneral.\n The Company is subject to examination, regulation, and periodic reporting as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any other bank or bank holding company. Prior Federal Reserve Board approval would be required for the Company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than five percent of any class of voting shares of the bank or bank holding company.\nA bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in non-banking activities, or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than five percent of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. The Federal Reserve Board has allowed by regulation some exceptions based on activities closely related to banking including: (i) making or servicing loans; (ii) performing certain data processing services; (iii) providing discount brokerage services; (iv) acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; and (v) acquiring a savings and loan association whose direct and indirect activities are limited to those permitted for bank holding companies.\nThe Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 authorized a bank holding company that meets specified conditions, including being \u201cwell capitalized\u201d and \u201cwell managed\u201d as defined in the regulations, to opt to become a \u201cfinancial holding company\u201d and thereby engage in a broader array of financial activities. Such activities can include insurance and investment banking. The Company has elected to become a financial holding company.\nThe Company is subject to the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s capital adequacy requirements for bank holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components \n22\nTable of Contents\nof capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves. Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the Bank apply also to the Company. \nFederal Reserve Board policy requires that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength doctrine.\nThe Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization\u2019s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior consultation with and nonobjection of the Federal Reserve Board with respect to dividends in certain circumstances, such as where the company\u2019s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company\u2019s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company\u2019s capital needs and overall financial condition. Such Federal Reserve Board consultation and nonobjection was required for certain dividends paid by the Company during the first half of 2021. The Federal Reserve Board guidance also provides for consultation and nonobjection for material increases in the amount of a bank holding company\u2019s common stock dividend. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized.\nFederal regulations require a bank holding company to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any repurchase or redemption of then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the repurchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such repurchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company\u2019s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption under certain circumstances. There is an exception to this approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain other conditions. Federal Reserve guidance provides for regulatory consultation and nonobjection under specified circumstances prior to a holding company redeeming or repurchasing regulatory capital instruments, including common stock, regardless of the applicability of the previously referenced notification requirement.\nThese regulatory policies could affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends, repurchase shares of its stock, or otherwise engage in capital distributions.\nThe status of the Company as a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act does not exempt it from certain federal and state laws and regulations applicable to corporations generally, including, without limitation, certain provisions of the federal securities laws.\nAcquisition of the Company.\n Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a bank holding company such as the Company unless the Federal Reserve Board has been given 60 days\u2019 prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined for this purpose, means ownership, control of or power to vote 25% or more of any class of voting stock. Acquisition of more than 10% of any class of a bank holding company\u2019s voting stock constitutes a rebuttable presumption of control under the regulations under certain circumstances including where, is the case with the Company, the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nMassachusetts Holding Company Regulation.\n In addition to the federal holding company regulations, a bank holding company organized or doing business in Massachusetts must comply with requirements under Massachusetts law. Approval of the Massachusetts regulatory authorities is generally required for the Company to acquire 25 percent or more of the voting stock of another depository institution. Similarly, prior regulatory approval would be necessary for any person or company to acquire 25 percent or more of the voting stock of the Company.\n23\nTable of Contents\nMergers and Acquisitions\nThe Company and the Bank have authority to engage, and have engaged, in acquisitions of other depository institutions. Such transactions are subject to a variety of conditions including, but not limited to, required stockholder approvals and the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. Necessary regulatory approvals include those required by the federal Bank Holding Company Act and/or Bank Merger Act, Massachusetts law and, if the target institution is located in a state other than Massachusetts, the law of that state. When considering merger applications, the federal regulators must evaluate such factors as the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the parties, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served (including performance of the parties under the Community Reinvestment Act), competitive factors, any risk to the stability of the United States banking or financial system and the effectiveness of the institutions involved in combating money laundering activities. Both the Bank Holding Company Act and the Bank Merger Act provide for a waiting period of 15 to 30 days following approval by the federal banking regulator within which the United States Department of Justice may file objections to the merger under the federal antitrust laws. Massachusetts law requires the Commissioner (or Board of Bank Incorporation in certain cases) to consider such factors as whether competition among banking institutions will be unreasonably affected and whether public convenience and advantage will be promoted (including whether the merger will result in net new benefits).\nOther Regulations\nConsumer Protection Laws.\n The Bank is subject to federal and state consumer protection statutes and regulations applicable to depository institutions. These include the Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide certain information about home mortgage and refinance loans; the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit; the Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the provision of consumer information to credit reporting agencies and the use of consumer information; the Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; and the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, governing automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers\u2019 rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services. Since the Bank has exceeded $10 billion of consolidated assets, compliance with such federal consumer protection statutes and regulations is examined for and enforced by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau rather than the FDIC.\nThe Bank also is subject to Massachusetts and federal laws protecting the confidentiality of consumer financial records, and limiting the ability of the institution to share non-public personal information with third parties.\nThe Community Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) establishes a requirement for federal banking agencies that, in connection with examinations of depository institutions within their jurisdiction, the agencies evaluate the record of the depository institutions in meeting the credit needs of their local communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions. These factors are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or new facility. Under the CRA, institutions are assigned a rating of \u201coutstanding,\u201d \u201csatisfactory,\u201d \u201cneeds to improve,\u201d or \u201csubstantial non-compliance.\u201d A less than \u201csatisfactory\u201d rating would result in the suspension of any growth of the Bank through acquisitions or opening de novo branches until the rating is improved. As of the most recent CRA examination by the FDIC, the Bank\u2019s CRA rating was \u201csatisfactory.\u201d\nAnti-Money Laundering Laws\n.\n The Bank is subject to extensive anti-money laundering provisions and requirements, which require the institution to have in place a comprehensive customer identification program and an anti-money laundering program and procedures. These laws and regulations also prohibit depository institutions from engaging in business with foreign shell banks; require depository institutions to have due diligence procedures and, in some cases, enhanced due diligence procedures for foreign correspondent and private banking accounts; and improve information sharing between depository institutions and the U.S. government. The Bank has established policies and procedures intended to comply with these provisions.\nTaxation\n \nThe Company reports its income on a calendar year basis using the accrual method of accounting. This discussion of tax matters is only a summary and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company \n24\nTable of Contents\nand its subsidiaries. Further discussion of income taxation is contained in a note to the financial statements. The federal income tax laws apply to the Company in the same manner as to other corporations with some exceptions. The Company may exclude from income 100 percent of dividends received from the Bank and from Berkshire Insurance Group as members of the same affiliated group of corporations. The Company reports income on a calendar year basis to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Massachusetts tax law generally permits special tax treatment for a qualifying limited purpose \u201csecurities corporation.\u201d The Bank\u2019s securities corporations all qualify for this treatment, and are taxed at a 1.3% rate on their gross income.\n25\nTable of Contents", "item1a": ">ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe risks set forth below, in addition to the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, strategic objectives, and operating results. In addition to the risks set forth below and the other risks described in this annual report, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial that could materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, strategic objectives, or operating results. As a result, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors set forth below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic affected all aspects of the company\u2019s business in 2021 and 2020. The impact of the pandemic is discussed in the \"Operating\" risk factors below, but it should be understood as affecting the overall risk environment and risk factors of the Company.\nRisk Factors Summary\nLending Risks\n\u2022\nDeterioration in the Housing Sector, Commercial Real Estate, and Related Markets May Adversely Affect Business and Financial Results.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s Emphasis on Commercial Lending May Expose the Company to Increased Lending Risks, Which Could Hurt Profits.\n\u2022\nThe Company is Subject to a Variety of Risks in Connection With Any Sale of Loans it May Conduct.\n\u2022\nThe Company is Exposed to Risk of Environmental Liability When It Takes Title to Property.\n\u2022\nNew Third Party Lending Relationships and Sourcing Channels May Increase Lending Risk\nOperating Risks\n\u2022\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic is Adversely Affecting, and Will Likely Continue to Adversely Affect, the Company\u2019s Business, Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Results of Operations. \n\u2022\nThe Company is Subject to Security and Operational Risks Relating to the Use of Technology that Could Damage the Company's Reputation and Business.\n\u2022\nThe Company Faces Cybersecurity Risks, Including Denial of Service Attacks, Ransomware, Hacking and Identity Theft that Could Result in the Disclosure of Confidential Information or the Creation of Unauthorized Transactions, Which Could Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Business or Reputation and Create Significant Legal and Financial Exposure.\n\u2022\nCounterparties and Correspondents Expose the Company to Risks.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s Business is Reliant on Outside Vendors.\n\u2022\nDevelopment of New Products and Services May Impose Additional Costs on the Company and May Expose It to Increased Operational Risk.\n\u2022\nThe Discontinuation of LIBOR and the Emergence of One or More Alternative Benchmark Indices to Replace LIBOR Could Adversely Impact the Company\u2019s Business and Results of Operations.\n26\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity Risks\n\u2022\nThe Company's Wholesale Funding Sources May Prove Insufficient to Replace Deposits at Maturity and Support Operations and Future Growth.\n\u2022\nThe Company's Ability to Service Our Debt, Pay Dividends, and Otherwise Pay Obligations as They Come Due Is Substantially Dependent on Capital Distributions from the Bank, and These Distributions Are Subject to Regulatory Limits and Other Restrictions. The Company\u2019s Stock Repurchase Program is also Dependent on These Distributions.\n\u2022\nThe Loss Recorded in 2020 May Have an Adverse Effect on Future Dividend Payments to Common Shareholders.\n\u2022\nSecondary Mortgage Market Conditions Could Have a Material Impact on the Company\u2019s Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nInterest Rates\n\u2022\nMarket Interest Rate Conditions Could Adversely Affect Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nSecurities Market Value Risks\n\u2022\nDeclines in the Value of Certain Investment Securities Could Require Write-Downs, Which Would Reduce Earnings.\nRegulatory Matters Risks\n\u2022\nLegislative and Regulatory Initiatives May Affect Business Activities and Increase Operating Costs.\n\u2022\nProvisions of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, and Delaware Law, as Well as State and Federal Banking Regulations, Could Delay or Prevent a Takeover of Us by a Third Party.\nSignificant Accounting Estimates Risks\n\u2022\nVarious Factors May Cause Our Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans to Increase.\n\u2022\nFair Value Measurements May Be Affected by Inherent Uncertainties\nTrading of the Company's Common Stock\n\u2022\nThe Trading History of the Company\u2019s Common Stock is Characterized By Low Trading Volume. The Value of Shareholder Investments May be Subject to Sudden Decreases Due to the Volatility of the Price of the Common Stock\n.\nLending\nDeterioration in the Housing Sector, Commercial Real Estate, and Related Markets May Adversely Affect Business and Financial Results.\nReal estate lending is a major business activity for the Company. Real estate market conditions affect the value and marketability of real estate collateral, and they also affect the cash flows, liquidity, and net worth of many borrowers whose operations and finances depend on real estate market conditions. Adverse conditions in the Company's market areas could reduce growth rates, affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans, and generally affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Potential increases in interest rates could increase capitalization rates which could adversely affect commercial property appraisals and collateral value. Similarly, if residential mortgage interest rates increase from lows in recent years, residential property values may be adversely impacted.\n \nPandemic impacts on the supply and demand of residential properties have caused unusual price appreciation in many markets, which may not be sustained if market conditions normalize.\nThe Company\u2019s Emphasis on Commercial Lending May Expose the Company to Increased Lending Risks, Which Could Hurt Profits.\nThe Company emphasizes commercial lending, which generally exposes the Company to a greater risk of nonpayment and loss because repayment of such loans often depends on the successful operations and income stream of the borrowers. Commercial loans are historically more susceptible to delinquency, default, and loss during economic downturns. Commercial lending involves larger loan sizes and larger relationship exposures, with greater \n27\nTable of Contents\npotential impact on profits in the event of adverse loan performance. The majority of the Company\u2019s commercial loans are secured by real estate and subject to the previously discussed real estate risk factors, as well as risks specific to individual properties and property types. Geographic expansion may result in risks not previously experienced by the Company or which it is unfamiliar with monitoring or resolving. Recent expansion has been focused on the Greater Boston market, where the Bank may be financing projects with larger loan amounts where the Bank has less experience than in its traditional market areas and where competition may result in different lending structures. Recent expansion of the commercial lending team may expose the Company to new markets and risks if new lenders are not integrated with the Company\u2019s policies, controls, and procedures.\nCommercial lending activities pose higher risk of fraud. In 2019, the Company wrote-off the $16 million balance of a secured commercial loan in circumstances involving alleged borrower fraud. This asset was a participating interest in a commercial loan managed by another financial institution. Such participating interests involve risks related to counterparty performance, as further described in a later risk factor. In the case of this loan, the Company has filed legal claims against the agent bank in pursuit of the recovery of some of the loss recorded by the Company. The outcome of such legal proceedings is subject to uncertainty.\n \nThe Company is Subject to a Variety of Risks in Connection With Any Sale of Loans it May Conduct.\nThe Company routinely sells newly originated residential mortgage loans and SBA guaranteed business loans, and may also sell other loans or loans portfolios. It may make certain representations and warranties to the purchaser concerning the loans sold and the procedures under which those loans have been originated and serviced. If any of these representations and warranties are invalid, the Company may be required to refund premiums, indemnify the purchaser for any related costs or losses, or it may be required to repurchase part or all of the affected loans, which may be impaired. The Company may also be required to repurchase loans as a result of borrower fraud or in the event of early payment default by the borrower on a loan it has sold. The Company\u2019s ability to maintain seller/servicer relationships with government agencies and government backed entities may be jeopardized in the event of the emergence of one or more of the above risks. Demand for the Company\u2019s loans in the secondary markets could also be affected by these risks, which could lead to a reduction in related business activities.\nThe Company may be required to reduce the value of any loans it marks as held for sale, which could adversely affect its results of operations. As a result of the Company\u2019s strategic initiatives, the Company sold certain loans which were previously held for investment and conducted sales with buyers who it had not previously transacted with.\nThe Company is Exposed to Risk of Environmental Liability When It Takes Title to Property.\nIn the course of its business, the Company may foreclose on and take title to real estate. As a result, the Company could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. The Company may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property.\nNew Third Party Lending Relationships and Sourcing Channels May Increase Lending Risk.\n \nThe Company is expanding its lending sourcing channels, including forming a residential mortgage conduit, partnering with fintech online lenders, and expanding its commercial loan sourcing channels.\n \nIt is also relying more on third party loan servicing. These activities may increase the underwriting risks and loan administration risks in managing its lending activities.\n28\nTable of Contents\nOperating\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic is Adversely Affecting, and Will Likely Continue to Adversely Affect, the Company\u2019s Business, Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Results of Operations. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the U.S. and global economy; disrupted U.S. and global supply chains and labor markets; \n \ncreated significant volatility and disruption in financial markets; impacted rates and yields on U.S. Treasury securities; resulted in increased credit risk in certain \n \nindustries; increased demands on capital and liquidity; and affected employment and consumer confidence. In addition, the pandemic has resulted in temporary closures and curtailment of individual and business activities in our footprint. The pandemic has caused us, and could continue to cause us, increases in the Company's allowance for credit losses and subsequent increases in credit losses in our loan portfolios. Some of the risks the Company faces from the pandemic include, but are not limited to: the health and availability of our colleagues, the supply of labor, inflationary impacts on operating costs, the financial condition of our clients and the demand for our products and services, changes in \n \ninterest rates, recognition of credit losses and increases in the allowance for credit losses, impacts\n \nif customers draw on their lines of credit or draw down deposits or seek additional loans to help finance their businesses, and a significant deterioration of business conditions in our markets. Furthermore, the pandemic has caused us to recognize impairment of our goodwill and there could be impairment of our financial assets. Sustained adverse effects may also increase our cost of capital, prevent us from satisfying our minimum regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory requirements, or result in downgrades in our credit rating. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the continued effectiveness of our business continuity plan, the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our customers, colleagues, counterparties and service providers, and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.\nGovernmental authorities have taken significant measures to provide economic assistance to individual households and businesses, stabilize the markets, and support economic growth. The future impact of these measures is unknown, and they may not be sufficient to mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic. We also face an increased risk of litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of the pandemic on market and economic conditions and actions governmental authorities take in response to those conditions.\nThe length of the pandemic and the effectiveness of the measures being put in place to address it are unknown.\n \nUntil the effects of the pandemic subside, we face possible impacts on liquidity, operating revenues, and credit performance.\n \nTo the extent the pandemic adversely affects our business, financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company is Subject to Security and Operational Risks Relating to the Use of Technology that Could Damage the Company's Reputation and Business.\nSecurity breaches of confidential information in our technology platforms could expose the Company to possible liability and damage its reputation. Any compromise of data security could also deter customers from using the Company's services. The Company relies on industry standard internet security and authentication systems to effect secure transmission of data. These precautions may not protect the Company's security systems from compromises or breaches and could result in damage to its reputation and business. The Company utilizes third party core banking software, in addition to other outsourced data processing. If third party providers encounter difficulties or if the Company has difficulty in communicating and/or transmitting with such third parties, it could significantly affect its ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions, which could significantly affect its business operations. The Company interfaces with electronic payments systems which are subject to security and operational risks. The Company utilizes file encryption in designated internal systems and networks and is subject to certain state and federal regulations regarding how the Company manages data security. The Company's enterprise governance risk and compliance function includes a framework of controls, policies and technologies to monitor and protect information from cyberattacks, mishandling, and loss, together with safeguards related to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. Natural disasters and disaster recovery risks could affect its operating systems, which could affect its reputation. The Company's business continuity program addresses crisis \n29\nTable of Contents\nmanagement, business impact, and data and systems recovery. Potential problems with the management of technology security and operational risks may affect regulatory compliance, which could affect operating costs and expansion plans.\nThe Company Faces Cybersecurity Risks, Including Denial of Service Attacks, Ransomware, Hacking and Identity Theft that Could Result in the Disclosure of Confidential Information or the Creation of Unauthorized Transactions, Which Could Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Business or Reputation and Create Significant Legal and Financial Exposure.\nBanking institutions face increased cybersecurity risks due to the number of employees that are working remotely in regions impacted by stay-at-home orders. Increased levels of remote access create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities, and employees may be more susceptible to phishing and social engineering attempts due to work responsibilities at home. In addition, technological resources may be strained due to the number of remote users. Banking institutions should evaluate their cybersecurity risks in light of these issues and update their existing risk factors for any material changes or developments\nThe Company\u2019s computer systems and network infrastructure are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities or identity theft. Financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, steal financial assets, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means. Denial of service attacks have been launched against a number of large financial services institutions. As a growing regional bank, the Company may be subject to similar attacks in the future. Hacking and identity theft risks could cause serious reputational harm and possible financial loss to the Company. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and the Company may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks.\nThe Company may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize these risks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss. Despite efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems, the Company will not be able to anticipate all security breaches of these types, and the Company may not be able to implement effective preventive measures against such security breaches. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of the Company\u2019s systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to its data or that of its clients or to conduct unauthorized financial transactions.\nThese risks may increase in the future as the Company continues to increase its mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expands its internal usage of web-based products and applications. A successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause serious negative consequences to the Company, including significant disruption of operations, misappropriation of confidential information of the Company or that of its customers, or damage to computers or systems of the Company or those of its customers and counterparties. A security breach could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to the Company or to its customers, loss of confidence in the Company\u2019s security measures, significant litigation exposure, and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nCounterparties and Correspondents Expose the Company to Risks.\nThe Company's use of derivative financial instruments exposes us to financial and contractual risks with counterparties. The Company maintains correspondent bank relationships, manage certain loan participations, engage in securities and funding transactions, and undergo other activities with financial counterparties that are customary to its industry. The Company also utilizes services from major vendors of technology, telecommunications, and other essential operating services. There is financial, reputational, and operational risk in these relationships, which the Company seeks to manage through internal controls and procedures, but there are no assurances that the Company will not experience loss or interruption of its business as a result of unforeseen events with these providers. The Company's mortgage banking operations have exposed us to counterparty transactions including the use of third parties to participate in the management of interest rate risk and mortgage sales and \n30\nTable of Contents\nhedging. Financial, reputational, and operational risks are inherent in these counterparty and correspondent relationships. The Company could experience losses if there are failures in the controls or accounting, including those related to derivatives activities or if there are performance failures by any counterparties. The risk of loss is increased when interest rates change suddenly and if the intended hedging objectives are not achieved as a result of market or counterparty behaviors.\nThe Company\u2019s Business is Reliant on Outside Vendors.\nThe Company\u2019s business is highly dependent on the use of certain outside vendors for its day-to-day operations. The Company\u2019s operations and reputation\n \nare exposed to risk that a vendor may not perform in accordance with established performance standards required in its agreements for any number of reasons including a change in their senior management, their financial condition, their product line or mix and how they support existing customers, or a simple change in their strategic focus. While the Company has comprehensive programs, policies and procedures in place to mitigate risk at all phases of vendor management from selection, to performance monitoring and renewals, the failure of a vendor to perform in accordance with contractual agreements could be disruptive to its business, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, strategic objectives, and results of operations.\nDevelopment of New Products and Services May Impose Additional Costs on the Company and May Expose It to Increased Operational Risk.\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance depends, in part, on its ability to develop and market new and innovative services and to adopt or develop new technologies that differentiate its products or provide cost efficiencies, while avoiding increased related expenses. This dependency is exacerbated in the current \u201cFinTech\u201d environment, where financial institutions are investing significantly in evaluating new technologies, such as \u201cBlockchain,\u201d and developing potentially industry-changing new products, services and industry standards. The introduction of new products and services can entail significant time and resources, including regulatory approvals. Substantial risks and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including technical and control requirements that may need to be developed and implemented, rapid technological change in the industry, the Company\u2019s ability to access technical and other information from its clients, the significant and ongoing investments required to bring new products and services to market in a timely manner at competitive prices and the preparation of marketing, sales and other materials that fully and accurately describe the product or service and its underlying risks. The Company\u2019s failure to manage these risks and uncertainties also exposes it to enhanced risk of operational lapses which may result in the recognition of financial statement liabilities. Regulatory and internal control requirements, capital requirements, competitive alternatives, vendor relationships and shifting market preferences may also determine if such initiatives can be brought to market in a manner that is timely and attractive to the Company\u2019s clients. Products and services relying on internet and mobile technologies may expose the Company to fraud and cybersecurity risks. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new products or services could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and reputation, as well as on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Discontinuation of LIBOR and the Emergence of One or More Alternative Benchmark Indices to Replace LIBOR Could Adversely Impact the Company\u2019s Business and Results of Operations.\nThe Company\u2019s floating-rate funding, certain hedging transactions and certain of the Company\u2019s products, such as floating-rate loans and mortgages, determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to a benchmark rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), or to an index, currency, basket or other financial metric. Pursuant to regulations, the use of LIBOR on new contracts was discontinued on December 31, 2021, and LIBOR will cease publication after June 30, 2023.\nRegulators and various financial industry groups have sponsored or formed committees (e.g., the Federal Reserve-sponsored Alternative Reference Rates Committee) to, among other things, facilitate the identification of an alternative benchmark index to replace LIBOR, and publish consultations on recommended practices for transitioning away from LIBOR, including (i) the utilization of recommended fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, and (ii) development of alternative pricing methodologies for recommended alternative benchmarks such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-based \n31\nTable of Contents\nrepurchase transactions. At this time, it is still not possible to predict whether these recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted in the market, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments.\n \nThe Company has adopted SOFR as its preferred benchmark as an alternative to LIBOR for use in new contracts beginning on January 1, 2022.\n \nThe discontinuation of LIBOR could result in changes to the Company\u2019s risk exposures (for example, if the anticipated discontinuation of LIBOR adversely affects the availability or cost of floating-rate funding and, therefore, the Company\u2019s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates) or otherwise result in losses on a product or having to pay more or receive less on securities that the Company has issued or owns. A substantial portion of the Company\u2019s on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments are indexed to LIBOR, including interest rate swap agreements and other contracts used for hedging and trading account purposes, loans to commercial customers and consumers (including mortgage loans and other loans), and long-term borrowings. In addition, such uncertainty could result in pricing volatility and increased capital requirements, loss of market share in certain products, adverse tax or accounting impacts, and compliance, legal and operational costs and risks.\nLiquidity\nThe Company's Wholesale Funding Sources May Prove Insufficient to Replace Deposits at Maturity and Support Operations and Future Growth.\nThe Company must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. As a part of its liquidity management, the Company uses a number of funding sources in addition to deposit growth and cash flows from loans and investments. These sources include Federal Home Loan Bank advances, proceeds from the sale of loans, and liquidity resources at the holding company. The Company uses brokered deposits both to support ongoing growth and to provide enhanced deposit insurance to support large dollar commercial relationships. The Company's financial flexibility will be severely constrained if the Company is unable to maintain access to wholesale funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable costs. Turbulence in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect liquidity and financial condition and the willingness of certain counterparties and customers to do business with the Company.\nThe Company's Ability to Service Our Debt, Pay Dividends, and Otherwise Pay Obligations as They Come Due Is Substantially Dependent on Capital Distributions from the Bank, and These Distributions Are Subject to Regulatory Limits and Other Restrictions. The Company\u2019s Stock Repurchase Program is also Dependent on These Distributions.\nA substantial source of holding company income is the receipt of dividends from the Bank, from which the Company services debt, pay obligations, and pay shareholder dividends. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank and other factors, that the applicable regulatory authorities could assert that payment of dividends or other types of payments are an unsafe or unsound practice. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends, the Company may not be able to service debt, pay debt obligations, or pay dividends on its common stock. The Company may also be unable to repurchase common stock under its Stock Repurchase Program.\nThe Loss Recorded in 2020 May Have an Adverse Effect on Future Dividend Payments to Common Shareholders.\nDue to the loss in the first half of 2020 and its impact on retained earnings, the Bank requires approval from the Massachusetts Division of Banks in order to continue to be a source of dividend income to the Company. Over the long term, these dividends are a source of funds to the parent to support dividend payments to Company shareholders. Also due to the loss, the Company requires nonobjection from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston for future shareholder dividend payments. Future payments of dividends will also depend on the Board\u2019s holistic assessment of the Company\u2019s operating, risk, and financial situations and current circumstances, as well as regulatory assessments of these factors.\nSecondary Mortgage Market Conditions Could Have a Material Impact on the Company\u2019s Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIn addition to being affected by interest rates, the secondary mortgage markets are also subject to investor demand for residential mortgage loans and increased investor yield requirements for these loans. These conditions may \n32\nTable of Contents\nfluctuate or worsen in the future. As a result, a prolonged period of secondary market illiquidity may reduce the Company\u2019s loan production volumes and operating results.\nSecondary markets are significantly affected by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae (collectively, the \u201cAgencies\u201d) for loan purchases that meet their conforming loan requirements. These agencies could limit purchases of conforming loans due to capital constraints, a change in the criteria for conforming loans or other factors. Proposals to reform mortgage finance could affect the role of the Agencies and the market for conforming loans which comprise the majority of the Company\u2019s mortgage lending and related originations income.\nInterest Rates\nMarket Interest Rate Conditions Could Adversely Affect Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nNet interest income is the Company's largest source of income. Changes in interest rates can affect the level of net interest income and other elements of net income. The Company\u2019s interest rate sensitivity is discussed in more detail in Item 7A of this report and is the primary market risk to its condition and operations. Changes in interest rates can also affect the demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, and the supply conditions in the U.S. financial and capital markets. Changes in the level of interest rates may negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to originate real estate loans, the value of its assets and its ability to realize gains from the sale of assets, all of which ultimately affect earnings.\n \nChanges in interest rates may also affect the market value of the Company\u2019s investment securities portfolio, which may affect the level and adequate of its regulatory capital.\n \nThe Federal Open Market Committee has indicated that it plans to increase interest rates in 2022.\n \nSecurities Market Values\nDeclines in the Value of Certain Investment Securities Could Require Write-Downs, Which Would Reduce Earnings.\nDeclines in the value of investment securities due to market conditions and/or issuer impairment could result in losses that can reduce capital and earnings. The Company\u2019s investment in equity securities and non-investment grade debt securities present heightened credit and price risks. Under new accounting standards, equity gains and losses are recorded to current period operating results. The Company has an investment in the stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (\"FHLBB\") which could result in write-down in the event of impairment.\nRegulatory Matters\nLegislative and Regulatory Initiatives May Affect Business Activities and Increase Operating Costs.\nNew federal or state laws and regulations could affect lending, funding practices, capital, and liquidity standards. New laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes may also increase compliance costs and affect business and operations. Moreover, the FDIC sets the cost of FDIC insurance premiums, which can affect profitability.\nRegulatory capital requirements and their impact on the Company may change. The Company may need to raise additional capital in the future to support operations and continued growth. The Company's ability to raise capital, if needed, will depend on its condition and performance, and on market conditions.\nNew laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes, along with negative developments in the financial industry and the domestic and international credit markets, may significantly affect the markets in which the Company does business, the markets for and value of its loans and investments, and ongoing operations, costs and profitability. For more information, see \u201cRegulation and Supervision\u201d in Item 1 of this report.\nWith total assets over $10 billion,\n \nthe \n \nCompany and the Bank are subject to closer supervision by their primary regulators and, as to compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Company and the Bank are subject to capital stress testing expectations which require significant resources and infrastructure. If the Company\u2019s compliance with the enhanced supervision and requirements is insufficient, there can be significant negative consequences for its operations, profitability, and ability to further pursue its strategic growth plan.\nProvisions of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, and Delaware Law, as Well as State and Federal Banking Regulations, Could Delay or Prevent a Takeover of Us by a Third Party.\n33\nTable of Contents\nProvisions in the Company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws, the corporate law of the State of Delaware, and state and federal regulations could delay, defer or prevent a third party from acquiring us, despite the possible benefit stockholders, or otherwise adversely affect the price of its common stock. These provisions include: limitations on voting rights of beneficial owners of more than 10 percent of common stock; supermajority voting requirements for certain business combinations; the election of directors to terms of one year; and advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Company's Board of Directors and for proposing matters that stockholders may act on at stockholder meetings. In addition, the Company is subject to Delaware laws, including one that prohibits engaging in a business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date the person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met. These provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for the Company's common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, its common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by the Board.\nSignificant Accounting Estimates \nVarious Factors May Cause our Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans to Increase.\nThe Company has an allowance for current expected credit losses on loans maintained through a provision for credit losses charged to expense.  This represents our estimate of current expected credit losses based on an evaluation of risks within the portfolio of loans. The level of the allowance represents management\u2019s estimate of current expected credit losses over the contractual life of the existing loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and current trends and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, all of which may undergo frequent and material changes. Changes in economic and other conditions affecting borrowers, along with new information regarding existing loans other factors, may indicate the need for a future increase in the allowance.\nFair Value Measurements May Be Affected by Inherent Uncertainties\nThe Company uses fair value measurements to determine fair value disclosures and to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities, such as interest rate swaps, impaired loans, securities available for sale, and derivatives. Additionally, from time to time, the Company may be required to record certain assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis, such as certain impaired loans held for investment and capitalized servicing rights. Whenever there is no readily available market data, management uses its best estimate and assumptions in determining fair value, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management\u2019s judgment. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, our recorded earnings or disclosures could have been materially different from those reflected in these financial statements.\nTrading of the Company's Common Stock\nThe Trading History of the Company\u2019s Common Stock is Characterized By Low Trading Volume. The Value of Shareholder Investments May be Subject to Sudden Decreases Due to the Volatility of the Price of the Common Stock.\nThe level of interest and trading in the Company\u2019s stock depends on many factors beyond the Company's control. The market price of the Company's common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the factors discussed in other risk factors and the following: actual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results; changes in interest rates; changes in the legal or regulatory environment; press releases, announcements or publicity relating to the Company or its competitors or relating to trends in its industry; changes in expectations as to future financial performance, including financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts and investors; future sales of its common stock; changes in economic conditions in the marketplace, general conditions in the U.S. economy, financial markets or the banking industry; and other developments. These factors may adversely affect the trading price of the Company's common stock, regardless of actual operating performance, and could prevent stockholders from selling their common stock at a desirable price.\n34\nTable of Contents\nIn the past, stockholders have brought securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. The Company could be the target of similar litigation in the future, which could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\n35\nTable of Contents", "item7": ">Item 7-7A - Table 2 - Qualitative Aspects of Market Risk\nChange\u00a0in\nInterest\u00a0Rates-Basis\nPoints\u00a0(Rate\u00a0Ramp)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n1-\u00a012\u00a0Months\n13-\u00a024\u00a0Months\n$\u00a0Change\n%\u00a0Change\n$\u00a0Change\n%\u00a0Change\n(In\u00a0thousands)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAt December\u00a031, 2021\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n+200\n17,815\u00a0\n6.82\u00a0\n39,059\u00a0\n14.83\u00a0\n+100\n7,294\u00a0\n2.79\u00a0\n15,282\u00a0\n5.80\u00a0\n-100\n1,227\u00a0\n0.47\u00a0\n(1,356)\n(0.51)\nAt December\u00a031, 2020\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n+200\n(108)\n(0.03)\n12,199\u00a0\n4.01\u00a0\n+100\n(3,090)\n(0.99)\n(943)\n(0.31)\n-100\n5,408\u00a0\n1.73\u00a0\n6,769\u00a0\n2.22\u00a0\nAt year-end 2021, a 200 basis point parallel upward interest rate increase results in approximately a 7% increase in modeled NII compared to the static baseline view in the first year, and approximately a 15% increase in the second-year horizon. The Company has shifted towards asset sensitive positioning throughout 2021, and remains well-positioned for the forecast rate cycle ahead. Asset sensitivity is driven by elevated cash balances from loan payoffs, a predominantly floating-rate loan portfolio, and modeled assumptions for deposit pricing and beta. For purposes of NII sensitivity reporting, a weighted average deposit beta of 35-45% is assumed in asset-liability modeling. Our positioning to downward changes in market rates remains limited due to a smaller effective shock for assets and liabilities to reprice lower from the current rate environment. In addition to parallel shocks and ramps, the Company analyzes the impact of non-parallel shocks (i.e., yield curve twist scenarios). At this time, the primary driver of asset sensitivity is on the short-end of the yield curve, though upward changes in the long-end are also expected to be accretive to NII.\nEconomic value of equity is modeled to increase by 4.5% in the event of a 200 basis point upward parallel shock in interest rates. Based on market expectations for higher interest rates in 2022 and beyond, and on commentary from monetary authorities about easing monetary stimulus, it is anticipated that the Company\u2019s positive sensitivity to rising rates may contribute to its BEST goals for improved profitability.\nA critical component of modeling this scenario is the assumption of deposit interest rate sensitivity, which the Company continues to model at a 40% beta level after an initial low beta for the first 50 basis points of rising rates. Due to the low level of interest rates, the modeled sensitivity of a downward shift in interest rates is affected by assumptions related to market influences on spreads and floors.  Prime, mortgage rates, and deposits are floored. All other rates are zero bound. \nModeled interest rate sensitivity depends on other material assumptions. Market risk exposure is affected by the level and shape of the yield curve in markets for financial instruments including U.S. Treasury obligations, forward interest rate derivatives, the U.S. prime interest rate, and LIBOR rates. Also, the economic impact on customer and market behaviors of the COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain and may cause actual events to differ from assumptions. The behavior of markets under the historically unusual conditions currently prevailing may be different from modeling assumptions, and the Company continues to monitor the markets and the assumptions in its model.\n65\nTable of Contents\nITEM 8.\u00a0 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements and supplementary data required by this item are presented elsewhere in this report beginning on page\u00a0F-1, in the order shown below:\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID \n173\n)\n \nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December\u00a031, 2021, 2020, and 2019\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income/(Loss) for the years ended December\u00a031, 2021, 2020, and 2019\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders\u2019 Equity for the years ended December\u00a031, 2021, 2020, and 2019\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December\u00a031, 2021, 2020, and 2019\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nITEM 9.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\u00a0\nMANAGEMENT OF INTEREST RATE RISK AND MARKET RISK ANALYSIS\nQualitative Aspects of Market Risk\n. The Company seeks to provide sustainable net interest income (NII) under varying economic conditions, while protecting the economic value of assets and liabilities from adverse effects of changes in market interest rates. While a number of market factors affect the level of NII and the economic value of our assets and liabilities, changes in interest rates is the most significant aspect of our market risk.  As such, the Company maintains a regular cadence for review and oversight of its asset-liability policies and interest rate risk positioning with oversight from senior management and the Board of Directors. The manner and extent of the movement of interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a positive or negative impact on the Company\u2019s earnings.\nThe Company manages its interest rate risk by analyzing the sensitivity and mix of its assets and liabilities, including derivative financial instruments. The Company also uses secondary markets, brokerages, and counterparties to accommodate customer demand for long-term fixed rate loans and to provide it with flexibility in managing its balance sheet positions. \nQuantitative Aspects of Market Risk.\n The Company quantifies its NII sensitivity using an earnings simulation model that compares a baseline view of NII over 12 and 24 month horizons, based on a static view of the balance sheet and market interest rates, to a wide range of parallel and non-parallel rate shocks and ramps. In addition, the Company analyzes net income at risk and equity at risk from interest rate changes through discounted cash flow analysis. \nThe chart below shows an analysis of a scenario where interest rates ramp in a parallel manner over a period of 12 months compared to a base case of flat interest rates. Modeled assets and liabilities are assumed to reprice at respective repricing or maturity dates. Pricing caps and floors are included in the results, where applicable. The Company uses prepayment expectations set forth by market sources as well as Company generated data where applicable. Generally, cash flows from loans and securities are assumed to be reinvested to maintain a static balance sheet. Other assumptions about balance sheet mix are generally held constant. There were no material changes to the way that the Company measures market risk in 2021. \n64\nTable of Contents", "companyName": "Berkshire Hills Bancorp", "cusip": "084670702"}
