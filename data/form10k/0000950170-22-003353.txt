(\u201cFive Star REIT\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank, operates as a real estate investment trust that holds residential mortgages and commercial real estate loans. Five Star REIT provides additional flexibility and planning opportunities for the business of the Bank.\n\n\n-\n \n5\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nBusiness Strategy\n\n\nOur business strategy has been to maintain a community bank philosophy, which consists of focusing on and understanding the individualized banking and other financial services needs of individuals, municipalities and businesses of the local communities surrounding our primary service area. We believe this focus allows us to be more responsive to our customers\u2019 needs and provide a high level of personal service that differentiates us from larger competitors, resulting in long-standing and broad-based banking relationships. Our core customers are primarily small- to medium-sized businesses, individuals and community organizations who prefer to build banking, insurance and wealth management relationships with a community bank that offers high quality, competitively-priced products and services with personalized service. Because of our identity and origin as a locally operated bank, we believe that our level of personal service provides a competitive advantage over larger banks, which tend to consolidate decision-making authority outside local communities.\n\n\nA key aspect of our current business strategy is to foster a community-oriented culture where our customers and employees establish long-standing and mutually beneficial relationships. We believe that we are well-positioned to be a strong competitor within our market area because of our focus on community banking needs and customer service, our comprehensive suite of deposit, loan, insurance and wealth management products typically found at larger banks, our highly experienced management team and our strategically located banking centers. We have also broadened our service offerings to include financial advice and insurance solutions along with traditional banking needs.\n\n\nWe have evolved to meet changing customer needs by opening what we refer to as financial solution center branches. These financial solution centers have a smaller footprint than our traditional branches, focus on technology to provide solutions that fit our customer preferences for transacting business with us, and these branches are staffed by certified personal bankers who are trained to meet a broad array of customer needs. In recent years, we have opened four financial solution centers in the Rochester and Buffalo markets, and in February 2020, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the New York State Department of Financial Services approved our application to open two additional financial solution centers in Buffalo that opened in 2021. In addition, we are focused on continued expansion of product delivery channels and are investing in our digital banking platform to allow for greater flexibility in the customer experience. We believe that the foregoing factors all help to grow our core deposits, which supports a central element of our business strategy - the growth of a diversified and high-quality loan portfolio.\n\n\nAcquisition Strategy\n\n\nWe will continue to explore market expansion opportunities that complement current market areas as opportunities arise. Our primary focus will be on increasing market share within existing markets, while taking advantage of potential growth opportunities within our insurance and wealth management lines of business by acquiring new businesses that can be added to existing operations. We believe our capital position remains strong enough to support an active merger and acquisition strategy, and expansion of our core financial service businesses of banking, insurance and wealth management. Consequently, we continue to explore acquisition opportunities in these activities. In evaluating acquisition opportunities, we will balance the potential for earnings accretion with maintaining adequate capital levels, which could result in our common stock being the predominant form of consideration and/or the need for us to raise capital.\n\n\nConversations with potential strategic partners occur on a regular basis. The evaluation of any potential opportunity will favor a transaction that complements our core competencies and strategic intent, with a lesser emphasis being placed on geographic location or size. Additionally, we remain committed to maintaining a diversified revenue stream. Our senior management team has experience in acquisitions and post-acquisition integration of operations and is prepared to act promptly should a potential opportunity arise but will remain disciplined with its approach. We believe this experience positions us to successfully acquire and integrate additional financial services and banking businesses.\n\n\nHUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES STRATEGY\n\n\nIn order to continue to deliver on our mission of financial inclusion for all, it is crucial that we attract and retain talent who desire to enable financial equality through delivery of capable solutions, thoughtful innovation and equitable consumer options in the markets that we serve. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make the Company an inclusive, safe and healthy workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits, health and welfare programs.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEmployee Profile\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 625 employees situated across the United States. This represents an increase of 12 employees or 2% from December 31, 2020.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n-\n \n6\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 65% of our current workforce is female, 35% male, and our average tenure is 6.56 years, a decrease of 16% from an average tenure of 7.77 years as of December 31, 2020.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTotal Rewards\n\n\nAs part of our compensation philosophy, we believe that we must offer and maintain market competitive total rewards programs for our employees in order to attract and retain superior talent. In addition to market competitive base wages, our rewards programs include performance-based bonus opportunities, equity compensation, Company-sponsored retirement plans, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, remote work arrangements, flexible work schedules, adoption assistance, and employee assistance programs.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nHealth and Safety\n\n\nThe success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of flexible and convenient health and welfare programs, including benefits that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status and that offer choice where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant operating environment changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This includes supporting a majority of our employees to work from home or remotely, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work.  Many employees continue to work from home as we transition to a more flexible work environment.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTalent\n\n\nA core tenet of our talent system is to both develop talent from within and supplement with external hires. This approach has yielded loyalty and commitment among our employees which in turn grows our business, our products, and our customers, while also adding new talent, skillsets and ideas to support a continuous improvement mindset and our goals of a diverse and inclusive workforce.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have conducted intentional, strategic hiring in 2021 to supplement the organization with new skill sets and perspectives. Our talent acquisition team uses internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled and talented workers, and additionally we incent employee referrals for open positions.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur performance management framework positions our leaders as coaches who continuously develop and grow talent through ongoing performance and development discussions, formal talent and development assessments, goal setting and feedback and performance-based compensation programs.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDiversity and Inclusion\n \n\n\nWe strive toward having a powerful and diverse team of employees, knowing we are better together with our combined wisdom and intellect. With a commitment to equality, inclusion and workplace diversity, we focus on understanding, accepting, and valuing the differences between people. To accomplish this, we established a Diversity & Inclusion Advisory Council in 2020 made up of 18 employee representatives throughout our operating footprint. The Council meets regularly to provide feedback and ideas that guide our DEI strategy. We have begun a series of DEI-focused trainings to raise awareness of unconscious bias and equip leaders to build inclusive team experiences. We continued our commitment to equal employment opportunity through a robust affirmative action plan which includes annual compensation analyses and ongoing reviews of our selection and hiring practices alongside a continued focus on building and maintaining a diverse workforce.\n\n\nMARKET AREAS AND COMPETITION\n\n\nWe provide a wide range of banking and financial services to individuals, municipalities and businesses through a network of over 45 offices and an extensive ATM network throughout Western and Central New York. The region includes the counties of Allegany, Cattaraugus, Cayuga, Chautauqua, Chemung, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Ontario, Orleans, Schuyler, Seneca, Steuben, Wayne, Wyoming and Yates counties. Our banking activities, though concentrated in the communities where we maintain branches, also extend into neighboring counties. In addition, our consumer indirect lending presence includes the Capital District of New York and Northern and Central Pennsylvania.\n\n\nOur market area is economically diversified in that we serve both rural markets and the larger markets in and around Rochester and Buffalo. Rochester and Buffalo are the two largest metropolitan areas in New York outside of New York City, with a combined population of over two million people. We anticipate continuing to increase our presence in and around these metropolitan statistical\n \n\n\n-\n \n7\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nareas and complementary market areas in the coming years. For example, we opened two additional financial solution centers in Buffalo in 2021.\n\n\nWe face significant competition in both making loans and attracting deposits, as Western and Central New York have a high density of financial institutions. Our competition for loans comes principally from commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking companies, credit unions, and other financial services companies. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from commercial banks, savings banks and credit unions. We face additional competition for deposits from non-traditional fintech firms and non-depository competitors such as the mutual fund industry, securities and brokerage firms and insurance companies. We generally compete with other financial service providers on factors such as level of customer service, responsiveness to customer needs, availability and pricing of products, and geographic location. Our industry frequently experiences merger activity, which affects competition by eliminating some institutions while potentially strengthening the franchises of others.\n\n\nThe following table presents the Bank\u2019s market share percentage for total deposits as of June 30, 2021, in each county where we have operations. The table also indicates the ranking by deposit size in each market. All information in the table was obtained from S&P Global Market Intelligence, which compiles deposit data published by the FDIC as of June 30, 2021 and updates the information for any bank mergers and acquisitions completed subsequent to the reporting date.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounty\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMarket\nShare\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nMarket\nRank\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNumber of\nBranches \n(1)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllegany\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n7.8%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCattaraugus\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n24.0%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCayuga\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n6.9%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n6\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChemung\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n13.9%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErie\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.4%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n11\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n6\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenesee\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n18.6%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLivingston\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n32.6%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonroe\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2.2%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n8\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n8\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOntario\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n13.1%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrleans\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n23.7%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeneca\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n26.2%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteuben\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n32.2%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWyoming\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n66.2%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYates\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n32.7%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(1)\nNumber of branches current as of December 31, 2021.\n\n\nINVESTMENT ACTIVITIES\n\n\nOur investment policy is contained within our overall Asset-Liability Management and Investment Policy. This policy dictates that investment decisions will be made based on the safety of the investment, liquidity requirements, potential returns, cash flow targets, need for collateral and desired risk parameters. In pursuing these objectives, we consider the ability of an investment to provide earnings consistent with factors related to quality, maturity, marketability, pledgeable nature and risk diversification. Our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, guided by our Asset-Liability Committee (\u201cALCO\u201d), is responsible for investment portfolio decisions within the established policies.\n\n\nOur investment securities strategy is focused on providing liquidity to meet loan demand and redeeming liabilities, meeting pledging requirements, managing credit risks, managing overall interest rate risks and maximizing portfolio yield. Our current policy generally limits security purchases to the following:\n\n\n\u2022\nU.S. treasury securities;\n\n\n\u2022\nU.S. government agency securities, which are securities issued by official Federal government bodies (e.g., the Government National Mortgage Association (\u201cGNMA\u201d) and the Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d)), and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise securities, which are securities issued by independent organizations that are in part sponsored by the federal government (e.g., the Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d) system, the Federal National Mortgage Association (\u201cFNMA\u201d), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\u201cFHLMC\u201d) and the Federal Farm Credit Bureau);\n\n\n\u2022\nMortgage-backed securities (\u201cMBS\u201d), which include mortgage-backed pass-through securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and multi-family MBS issued by GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC;\n\n\n\u2022\nInvestment grade municipal securities, including revenue, tax and bond anticipation notes, statutory installment notes and general obligation bonds;\n\n\n\u2022\nCertain creditworthy unrated securities issued by municipalities;\n\n\n\u2022\nCertificates of deposit;\n\n\n-\n \n8\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nEquity securities at the holding company level;\n\n\n\u2022\nDerivative instruments; and\n\n\n\u2022\nLimited partnership investments.\n\n\nLENDING ACTIVITIES\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\nWe offer a broad range of loans including commercial business and revolving lines of credit, commercial mortgages, equipment loans, residential mortgage loans and home equity loans and lines of credit, home improvement loans, automobile loans and personal loans. Newly originated and refinanced fixed rate residential mortgage loans are either retained in our portfolio or sold to the secondary market with servicing rights retained.\n\n\nWe continually evaluate and update our lending policy. The key elements of our lending philosophy include the following:\n\n\n\u2022\nTo ensure consistent underwriting, employees must share a common view of the risks inherent in lending activities as well as the standards to be applied in underwriting and managing credit risk;\n\n\n\u2022\nPricing of credit products should be risk-based;\n\n\n\u2022\nThe loan portfolio must be diversified to limit the potential impact of negative events; and\n\n\n\u2022\nCareful, timely exposure monitoring through dynamic use of our risk rating system is required to provide early warning and assure proactive management of potential problems.\n\n\nCommercial Business and Commercial Mortgage Lending\n\n\nWe primarily originate commercial business loans in our market areas and underwrite them based on the borrower\u2019s ability to service the loan from operating income. We offer a broad range of commercial lending products, including term loans and lines of credit. Short and medium-term commercial loans, primarily collateralized, are made available to businesses for working capital (including inventory and receivables), business expansion (including acquisition of real estate, expansion and improvements) and the purchase of equipment. We offer commercial business loans to customers in the agricultural industry for short-term crop production, farm equipment and livestock financing. As a general practice, where possible, a first position collateral lien is placed on any available real estate, equipment or other assets owned by the borrower and a personal guarantee of the owner is obtained. As of December 31, 2021, $229.0 million, or 36%, of our aggregate commercial business loan portfolio were at fixed rates, while $409.3 million, or 64%, were at variable rates.\n\n\nWe also offer commercial mortgage loans to finance the purchase of real property, which generally consists of real estate with completed structures. Commercial mortgage loans are secured by first liens on the real estate and are typically amortized over a 10 to 20-year period. The underwriting analysis includes credit verification, appraisals and a review of the borrower\u2019s financial condition and repayment capacity. As of December 31, 2021, $659.6 million, or 47%, of the loans in our aggregate commercial mortgage portfolio were at fixed rates, while $753.2 million, or 53%, were at variable rates.\n\n\nWe utilize government loan guarantee programs where available and appropriate.\n\n\nGovernment Guarantee Programs\n\n\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) was passed by Congress and signed into law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act established the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d), an expansion of the SBA\u2019s 7(a) loan program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program (\u201cEIDL\u201d), administered directly by the SBA. As of December 31, 2021, we had PPP loans with an aggregate principal balance of $57.5 million that were covered by guarantees under this program.\n\n\nWe participate in other government loan guarantee programs offered by the SBA, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Rural Economic and Community Development and Farm Service Agency, among others. As of December 31, 2021, we had loans with an aggregate principal balance of $30.1 million that were covered by guarantees under these programs. The guarantees typically only cover a certain percentage of these loans. By participating in these programs, we are able to broaden our base of borrowers while reducing credit risk.\n\n\n-\n \n9\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nResidential Real Estate Lending\n\n\nWe originate fixed and variable rate one-to-four family residential mortgages collateralized by owner-occupied properties located in our market areas. We offer a variety of real estate loan products, including home improvement loans, closed-end home equity loans, and home equity lines of credit, which are generally amortized over periods of up to 30 years. Loans collateralized by one-to-four family residential real estate generally have been originated in amounts of no more than 80% of appraised value or have mortgage insurance. Mortgage title insurance and hazard insurance are normally required. We sell certain one-to-four family residential mortgages to the secondary mortgage market and typically retain the right to service the mortgages. We typically follow the underwriting and appraisal guidelines of the secondary market, including the FHLMC and the Federal Housing Administration, and service the loans in a manner that satisfies the secondary market agreements. As of December 31, 2021, our residential mortgage servicing portfolio totaled $272.7 million, the majority of which has been sold to the FHLMC. As of December 31, 2021, our residential real estate loan portfolio totaled $577.3 million, or 16% of our total loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2021, our residential real estate lines portfolio totaled $78.5 million, or 2% of our total loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2021, $528.1 million, or 91%, of the loans in our residential real estate loan portfolio were at fixed rates, while $49.2 million, or 9%, were at variable rates. The residential real estate lines portfolio primarily consists of variable rate lines. Approximately 93% of the loans and lines in our residential real estate portfolios were in first lien positions at December 31, 2021. We do not engage in sub-prime or other high-risk residential mortgage lending as a line-of-business.\n\n\nConsumer Lending\n\n\nWe offer a variety of loan products to our consumer customers, including automobile loans, secured installment loans and other types of secured and unsecured personal loans. At December 31, 2021, outstanding consumer loan balances were concentrated in indirect automobile loans.\n\n\nWe originate indirect consumer loans for a mix of new and used vehicles through franchised new car dealers. The consumer indirect loan portfolio is primarily comprised of loans with terms that typically range from 36 to 84 months. We have developed relationships with franchised new car dealers in Western, Central and the Capital District of New York, and Northern and Central Pennsylvania. As of December 31, 2021, our consumer indirect portfolio totaled $958.0 million, or 26% of our total loan portfolio. The consumer indirect loan portfolio primarily consists of fixed rate loans with relatively short durations.\n\n\nWe also originate, independently of the indirect loans described above, consumer automobile loans, recreational vehicle loans, boat loans, personal loans (collateralized and uncollateralized) and deposit account collateralized loans. The terms of these loans typically range from 12 to 60 months and vary based upon the nature of the collateral and the size of loan. A portion of the consumer lending program is underwritten on a secured basis using the customer\u2019s financed automobile, mobile home, boat or recreational vehicle as collateral. The other loans in our consumer portfolio totaled $14.5 million as of December 31, 2021, all of which were fixed rate loans.\n\n\nCredit Administration\n\n\nOur loan policy establishes standardized underwriting guidelines, as well as the loan approval process and the committee structures necessary to facilitate and ensure the highest possible loan quality decision-making in a timely and businesslike manner. The policy establishes requirements for extending credit based on the size, risk rating and type of credit involved. The policy also sets limits on individual lending authority and various forms of joint lending authority, while designating which loans are required to be approved at the committee level.\n\n\nOur credit objectives are to:\n\n\n\u2022\nCompete effectively and service the legitimate credit needs of our target market;\n\n\n\u2022\nEnhance our reputation for superior quality and timely delivery of products and services;\n\n\n\u2022\nProvide pricing that reflects the entire relationship and is commensurate with the risk profiles of our borrowers;\n\n\n\u2022\nRetain, develop and acquire profitable, multi-product, value added relationships with high quality borrowers;\n\n\n\u2022\nFocus on government guaranteed lending to meet the needs of the small businesses in our communities;\n\n\n\u2022\nDevelop efforts to serve minority and other traditionally underserved communities; and\n\n\n\u2022\nComply with all relevant laws and regulations.\n\n\nOur policy includes loan reviews, under the supervision of the Audit and Risk Oversight committees of our Board of Directors and directed by our Chief Risk Officer, in order to render an independent and objective evaluation of our asset quality and credit administration process.\n\n\n-\n \n10\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe assign risk ratings to loans in the commercial business and commercial mortgage portfolios. We use those risk ratings to:\n\n\n\u2022\nProfile the risk and exposure in the loan portfolio and identify developing trends and relative levels of risk;\n\n\n\u2022\nIdentify deteriorating credits;\n\n\n\u2022\nReflect the probability that a given customer may default on its obligations; and\n\n\n\u2022\nAssist with risk-based pricing.\n\n\nThrough the loan approval process, loan administration and loan review program, management seeks to continuously monitor our credit risk profile and assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and adequacy of the allowance for credit losses.\n\n\nWe have several procedures in place to assist in maintaining the overall quality of our loan portfolio. Delinquent loan reports are monitored by credit administration to identify adverse levels and trends. Loans, including loans individually evaluated for impairment, are generally classified as non-accruing if they are past due as to maturity or payment of principal or interest for a period of more than 90 days, unless such loans are well-collateralized and in the process of collection. Loans that are on a current payment status or past due less than 90 days may also be classified as non-accruing if repayment in full of principal and/or interest is uncertain.\n\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n\n\nThe allowance for credit losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses. The allowance reflects management\u2019s estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the portfolio, based on factors including, but not limited to:\n\n\n\u2022\nSpecific allocations for individually evaluated credits;\n\n\n\u2022\nSegmentation of credit exposures by similar credit characteristics;\n\n\n\u2022\nHistorical net charge-off experience by segment;\n\n\n\u2022\nCorrelation of segmented historical losses to a loss driver;\n\n\n\u2022\nEvaluation of historical loss emergence by segment;\n\n\n\u2022\nEvaluation and establishment of look-back periods by segment;\n\n\n\u2022\nEvaluation of prepayment and curtailment experience by segment;\n\n\n\u2022\nEvaluation of average life for each segment;\n\n\n\u2022\nLevels and trends in delinquent and non-accruing loans;\n\n\n\u2022\nTrends in volume and terms of loans;\n\n\n\u2022\nEffects of changes in lending policy;\n\n\n\u2022\nNational and local economic trends and conditions excluding the loss driver;\n\n\n\u2022\nRegulatory environment;\n\n\n\u2022\nPortfolio administration; \n\n\n\u2022\nPotential funding of unfunded commitments;\n\n\n\u2022\nEvaluation of held to maturity investments; and\n\n\n\u2022\nEvaluation of deferred interest receivable.\n\n\nOur methodology for estimating the allowance for credit losses includes the following:\n\n\n1.\nCollateral dependent commercial business and commercial mortgage loans, as well as, non-collateral dependent criticized loans of two-million dollars and greater are typically reviewed individually and assigned a specific loss allowance, if considered necessary, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). In addition, reflective of the heightened risk resulting from long-term deferrals afforded under the CARES Act of certain commercial business and commercial mortgage loans and individual evaluation was performed on certain of the most at risk longer term deferrals and a specific loss allowance was placed on them. Collectively, this is referred to as the Individually Evaluated component of the allowance for credit losses estimate.\n\n\n2.\nLoans not analyzed for a specific reserve are segmented into \u201cpools\u201d of loans based upon similar risk characteristics. This is referred to as the pooled loan component of the allowance for credit losses estimate. The Company has identified six portfolio segments of loans including commercial loans/lines, commercial mortgage, indirect loans, direct loans, residential lines of credit, and residential loans. Each segment, or pool, is quantitatively analyzed using a discounted cash flow approach over the life of the loan. The pooled loans estimate is based upon periodic review of the collectability of the loans quantitatively correlating historical loan experience with reasonable and supportable forecasts using forward looking information. Adjustments to the quantitative evaluation may be made for differences in current or expected qualitative risk characteristics such as changes in: underwriting standards, delinquency level, regulatory environment, economic condition, Company management and the status of portfolio administration including the Company\u2019s credit risk review function.\n\n\n-\n \n11\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3.\nThe Company\u2019s held to maturity (\u201cHTM\u201d) debt securities are also required to utilize the current expected credit losses approach to estimate expected credit losses. The Company\u2019s HTM debt securities included securities that are issued by U.S. government or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. These securities carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government, are widely recognized as \u201crisk free,\u201d and have a long history of zero credit loss. The Company also carries a portfolio of HTM municipal bonds. The Company measures its allowance for credit losses on HTM debt securities on a collective basis by major security type. The estimate is based on historical credit losses, if any, adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company considers the nature of the collateral, potential future changes in collateral values and available loss information.\n\n\n4.\nThe Company had made the election with the adoption of ASU 2016-13 of not measuring an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivable due to the Company\u2019s policy of writing off uncollectible accrued interest receivable balances in a timely manner, as described above.\n\n\n5.\nThe reserve for unfunded commitments (the \u201cUnfunded Reserve\u201d) represents the expected credit losses on off-balance sheet commitments such as unfunded commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. However, a liability is not recognized for commitments unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The unfunded reserve is recognized as a liability (other liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition), with adjustments to the reserve recognized as a provision for credit loss expense in the consolidated statements of income. The unfunded reserve is determined by estimating expected future fundings, under each segment, and applying the expected loss rates. Expected future fundings are based on historical averages of funding rates (i.e., the likelihood of draws taken). To estimate future fundings on unfunded balances, current funding rates are compared to historical funding rates. \n\n\nManagement presents a quarterly review of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors based on the methodology described above. See also the section titled \u201cAllowance for Credit Losses\u201d in Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\nSOURCES OF FUNDS\n\n\nOur primary sources of funds are deposits and borrowed funds.\n\n\nDeposits\n\n\nWe maintain a full range of deposit products and accounts to meet the needs of the residents and businesses in our primary service area. Products include an array of checking and savings account programs for individuals and businesses, including money market accounts, certificates of deposit, sweep investment capabilities as well as Individual Retirement Accounts and other qualified plan accounts. We rely primarily on competitive pricing of our deposit products, customer service and long-standing relationships with customers to attract and retain these deposits and seek to make our services convenient to the community by offering a choice of several delivery systems and channels, including telephone, mail, online, automated teller machines (\u201cATMs\u201d), debit cards, point-of-sale transactions, automated clearing house transactions (\u201cACH\u201d), remote deposit, and mobile banking via telephone or wireless devices. We also take advantage of the use of technology by offering business customers banking access via the Internet and various advanced cash management systems.\n\n\nWe also participate in reciprocal deposit programs, which enable depositors to receive FDIC insurance coverage for deposits exceeding the maximum insurable amount. Through these programs, deposits in excess of the maximum insurable amount are placed with multiple participating financial institutions. Reciprocal deposits totaled $771.4 million at December 31, 2021.\n\n\nBorrowings\n\n\nWe have access to a variety of borrowing sources and use both short-term and long-term borrowings to support our asset base. Borrowings from time-to-time include federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, FHLB advances and borrowings from the discount window of the FRB, as defined below.\n\n\nOther sources of funds include scheduled amortization and prepayments of principal from loans and mortgage-backed securities, maturities and calls of investment securities and funds provided by operations.\n\n\n-\n \n12\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOTHER INFORMATION\n\n\nWe also make available, free of charge through our website, all reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, as well as any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after those documents are filed with or furnished to the SEC. These filings may be viewed by accessing the \nSEC Filings\n subsection of the \nFinancials\n section of our website (\nwww.fiiwarsaw.com\n). Information available on our website is not a part of, and is not incorporated into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\nAll of the reports we file with the SEC, including this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, as well as any amendments thereto may be accessed at \nwww.sec.gov\n.\n\n\nSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\n\n\nWe are subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws. The regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole and not for the protection of shareholders and creditors.\n\n\nElements of the laws and regulations applicable to the Company and material to our operations are described below. The description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations and policies that are described. Also, such statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by Congress, state legislatures, and federal and state regulatory agencies. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company could have a material effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\n\n\nHolding Company Regulation\n. We are subject to comprehensive regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, frequently referred to as the Federal Reserve Board (\u201cFRB\u201d or \u201cFederal Reserve\u201d), under the Bank Holding Company Act (the \u201cBHC Act\u201d), as amended by, among other laws, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the \u201cGramm-Leach-Bliley Act\u201d) and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d). We are registered with the Federal Reserve as a financial holding company (\u201cFHC\u201d). We must file reports with the FRB and submit such additional information as the FRB may require, and our holding company and non-banking affiliates are subject to examination by the FRB. Under FRB policy, a financial holding company must serve as a source of strength for its subsidiary banks. Under this policy, the FRB may require, and has required in the past, a holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank. The BHC Act provides that a financial holding company must obtain FRB approval before:\n\n\n\u2022\nAcquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank, financial holding company or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would own or control more than 5% of such shares (unless it already owns or controls the majority of such shares);\n\n\n\u2022\nAcquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank, financial holding company or bank holding company, or\n\n\n\u2022\nMerging or consolidating with another financial holding company or bank holding company.\n\n\nThe BHC Act generally prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company, or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. However, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act amended portions of the BHC Act to authorize financial holding companies, such as us, to directly or through non-bank subsidiaries engage in securities, insurance and other activities that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity. In order to undertake and maintain these activities, a financial holding company must certify that all of the depository institutions controlled by the company are well capitalized and well managed.\n\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, Economic Growth Act, and Volcker Rule.\n The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the regulation of financial institutions, such as community banks, thrifts, and small bank and thrift holding companies, and the financial services industry.\n \n\n\nAlthough it was enacted in 2010, certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have yet to be fully implemented and may be impacted by future legislation, rulemaking or executive orders. Our management continues to monitor the ongoing implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and as new regulations are issued, will assess their effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\nIn May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cEconomic Growth Act\u201d) was enacted and impacted several of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The law provided certain regulatory relief to community banks, like us, with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets. This relief includes an exemption from the Volcker Rule, as discussed below.\n\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and from investing and sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds. The statutory provision implementing these restrictions is commonly called the \u201cVolcker Rule.\u201d The Economic Growth Act exempts banks with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets that does not engage in any covered activities other than trading in certain government, agency, state or municipal obligations, from any significant compliance obligations under the Volcker Rule. Because the Bank falls within the category of exempted banks, the Volcker Rule will not have a material effect on our\n \n\n\n-\n \n13\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict whether we may become subject to the Volcker Rule, or a similar rule, following additional legislative or regulatory action concerning community banks.\n\n\nDepository Institution Regulation.\n The Bank is subject to regulation by the FDIC. This regulatory structure includes:\n\n\n\u2022\nReal estate lending standards, which provide guidelines concerning loan-to-value ratios for various types of real estate loans;\n\n\n\u2022\nRisk-based capital rules, including accounting for interest rate risk, concentration of credit risk and the risks posed by non-traditional activities;\n\n\n\u2022\nRules requiring depository institutions to develop and implement internal procedures to evaluate and control credit and settlement exposure to their correspondent banks;\n\n\n\u2022\nRules restricting types and amounts of equity investments; and\n\n\n\u2022\nRules addressing various safety and soundness issues, including operations and managerial standards, standards for asset quality, earnings and compensation standards.\n\n\nCapital Requirements.\n The Company and the Bank are each required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the Federal Reserve. The current risk-based capital standards applicable to the Company and the Bank are based on the final capital framework for strengthening international capital standards, known as Basel III, of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.\n\n\nThe Basel III Rules, among other things, (i) introduce a new capital measure called CET1, which consists primarily of retained earnings and common stock, (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and \u201cAdditional Tier 1 capital\u201d instruments, such as preferred stock and certain convertible securities, meeting certain revised requirements, (iii) define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital, and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions/adjustments to capital as compared to historical regulations.\n\n\nUnder the Basel III Rules, the current minimum capital ratios, including an additional capital conservation buffer applicable to the Company and the Bank, are:\n\n\n\u2022\n7.0% CET1 to risk-weighted assets;\n\n\n\u2022\n8.5% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and\n\n\n\u2022\n10.5% Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets.\n\n\nBanking institutions that do not hold capital above the required minimum levels, including the capital conservation buffer, will face constraints on paying dividends and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.\n\n\nThe Basel III Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage-servicing rights (\u201cMSRs\u201d), certain deferred tax assets and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1.\n\n\nThe Basel III Rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings for a variety of asset classes that, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranges from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures.\n\n\nThe Economic Growth Act provided for a potential exception from the Basel III Rules for community banks that maintain a Community Bank Leverage Ratio (\u201cCBLR\u201d) of at least 8.0% to 10.0%. The CBLR is calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by the bank\u2019s average total consolidated assets. In the final rules approved by the FDIC in September 2019, qualifying community banking organizations that opt in to using the CBLR are considered to be in compliance with the Basel III Rules as long as the bank maintains a CBLR of greater than 9.0%. If a bank is not a qualifying community banking organization, does not opt in to using the CBLR, or cannot maintain a CBLR of greater than 9.0%, the bank would have to comply with the Basel III Rules. We determined to comply with the Basel III Rules instead of using the CBLR framework.\n\n\nLeverage Requirements.\n BHCs and banks are also required to comply with minimum leverage ratio requirements. These requirements provide for a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to total consolidated quarterly average assets (as defined for regulatory purposes), net of the loan loss reserve, goodwill and certain other intangible assets (the \u201cleverage ratio\u201d), of 4.0%.\n\n\nLiquidity Regulation.\n The liquidity coverage ratio (\u201cLCR\u201d), provided for in the Basel III liquidity framework, is designed to ensure that a bank maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high quality liquid assets equal to the bank\u2019s expected net cash outflows for a thirty-day time horizon under an acute liquidity stress scenario. The rules as adopted apply in their most comprehensive form only to advanced approaches financial or bank holding companies and depository institution subsidiaries of such financial or bank holding companies and, in a modified form, to banking organizations having $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets. Accordingly, they do not apply to either the Company or the Bank.\n \n\n\n-\n \n14\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSimilarly, the Basel III framework included a standard, referred to as the net stable funding ratio (\u201cNSFR\u201d), which is designed to promote more medium-and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banks over a one-year time horizon. Effective July 1, 2021, the NSFR standard requires large financial institutions to maintain a 1.0 ratio of available stable funding to required stable funding. The scope of financial institutions to which this standard applies is consistent with the LCR standard, and accordingly, neither the Company nor the Bank is required to comply with this standard. As a result, we do not manage our balance sheet to be compliant with these rules.\n\n\nPrompt Corrective Action.\n The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (\u201cFDIA\u201d), requires, among other things, the federal banking agencies to take \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA establishes five capital categories for FDIC-insured banks: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, under-capitalized, significantly under-capitalized and critically under-capitalized. A depository institution is deemed to be \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a CET 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and the institution is not subject to an order, written agreement, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific level for any capital measure.\n\n\nThe FDIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the capital category in which an institution is classified.\n \n\n\nFor further information regarding the capital ratios and leverage ratio of the Company and the Bank see the section titled \u201cSources and Uses of Capital Resources\u201d in Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The current requirements and the actual levels for the Company and the Bank are detailed in Note 15, Regulatory Matters, of the notes to consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\nDividends.\n The FRB policy is that a financial holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that its net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the holding company\u2019s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition, and that it is inappropriate for a financial holding company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Furthermore, a bank that is classified under the prompt corrective action regulations as \u201cunder-capitalized\u201d will be prohibited from paying any dividends.\n\n\nThe primary source of cash for dividends we pay is the dividends we receive from the Bank. The Bank is subject to various regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain capital above regulatory minimums. Approval of the New York State Department of Financial Services (the \u201cNY DFS\u201d) is required prior to paying a dividend if the dividend declared by the Bank exceeds the sum of the Bank\u2019s net profits for that year and its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years. At January 1, 2022, the Bank could declare dividends of $77.0 million from retained net profits of the preceding two years. The Bank declared dividends of $24.0 million and $23.0 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n\nFederal Deposit Insurance Assessments.\n The Bank is a member of the FDIC and pays an insurance premium to the FDIC to fund the Deposit Insurance Fund (\"DIF\") based upon the bank's assessable assets on a quarterly basis. Deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC and such insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government.\n\n\nThe current level of deposit insurance is $250,000. The coverage limit is per depositor, per insured depository institution for each account ownership category.\n\n\nThe minimum designated reserve ratio for the DIF is 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC defined the deposit insurance assessment base for an insured depository institution as an amount equal to the institution\u2019s average consolidated total assets during the assessment period minus average tangible equity. Deposit insurance premiums for the Bank are calculated based upon the average balance of total assets minus average tangible equity as of the close of business for each day during the calendar quarter. As of September 30, 2018, the FDIC had exceeded the minimum reserve ratio of 1.35%. We received credits for the portion of our regular assessments that contributed to growth in the reserve ratio to 1.35%, which applied to reduce regular assessments for quarters when the reserve ratio is at least 1.38%. We used these credits to reduce our regular assessments through the first quarter of 2020.\n\n\nThe FDIC has the flexibility to adopt actual rates that are higher or lower than the total base assessment rates adopted without notice and comment, if certain conditions are met.\n\n\nThe FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of and require reporting by FDIC-insured institutions. It is also authorized to terminate a depository bank\u2019s deposit insurance upon a finding by the FDIC that the bank\u2019s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule, regulation, order or condition enacted or imposed by the bank\u2019s regulatory agency. The termination of deposit insurance for the Bank would have a material adverse effect on our earnings, operations and financial condition.\n\n\n-\n \n15\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nConsumer Laws and Regulations.\n In addition to the laws and regulations discussed herein, the Bank is also subject to certain consumer federal and state laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. While the list set forth herein is not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include, among others, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act and these laws\u2019 respective state-law counterparts, as well as state usury laws and laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices. These and other federal and state laws, among other things, require disclosures of the cost of credit and terms of deposit accounts, provide substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, provide financial privacy protections, prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive practices, restrict the Company\u2019s ability to raise interest rates and subject the Company to substantial regulatory oversight. Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorneys\u2019 fees. Federal and state bank regulators, federal law enforcement agencies, state attorneys general and state and local consumer protection agencies may also seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies, including regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, fines and civil money penalties. Failure to comply with consumer protection requirements may also result in our failure to obtain any required bank regulatory approval for merger or acquisition transactions the Company may wish to pursue or our prohibition from engaging in such transactions even if approval is not required.\n\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d), and giving it responsibility for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB focuses on:\n\n\n\u2022\nRisks to consumers and compliance with the federal consumer financial laws, when it evaluates the policies and practices of a financial institution;\n\n\n\u2022\nThe markets in which firms operate and risks to consumers posed by activities in those markets;\n\n\n\u2022\nDepository institutions that offer a wide variety of consumer financial products and services or a more specialized focus; and\n\n\n\u2022\nNon-depository companies that offer one or more consumer financial products or services.\n\n\nThe CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks, including, among other things, the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts and practices. Abusive acts or practices are defined as those that materially interfere with consumers\u2019 ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service or take unreasonable advantage of consumers\u2019 (i) lack of financial savvy, (ii) inability to protect themselves in the selection or use of consumer financial products or services, or (iii) reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in their interests. The CFPB can issue cease-and-desist orders against banks and other entities that violate consumer financial laws. The CFPB may also institute a civil action against an entity in violation of federal consumer financial law in order to impose a civil penalty or injunction. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets, as well as their affiliates.\n\n\nBanking regulators take into account compliance with consumer protection laws when considering approval of a proposed transaction.\n\n\nCommunity Reinvestment Act.\n Pursuant to the Community Reinvestment Act (the \u201cCRA\u201d), under federal and New York State law, the Bank is obligated, consistent with safe and sound banking practices, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The FRB of New York and NY DFS periodically assess the Bank\u2019s record of performance under the CRA and issue one of the following ratings: \u201cOutstanding,\u201d \u201cSatisfactory,\u201d \u201cNeeds to Improve,\u201d or \u201cSubstantial Noncompliance.\u201d\n\n\nThe most recently completed evaluation of the Bank\u2019s performance under the CRA was conducted by the FRB of New York from January 1, 2013 through September 30, 2018 and resulted in an overall rating of \u201cSatisfactory.\u201d In reaching this rating, the FRB of New York evaluated HMDA-reportable, small business, small farm, consumer loans, community development loans, investments, philanthropic grants, and services provided.\n\n\nThe last CRA evaluation completed by NY DFS was for the time period from January 1, 2012 through September 30, 2017. This performance evaluation resulted in an overall rating by the NY DFS of \u201cSatisfactory.\u201d In reaching this rating the NY DFS considered the Bank\u2019s lending practices by the areas served, the geographic distribution of loans, borrower characteristics and use in community development projects, along with testing the ability of the Bank\u2019s investment and service activities to meet community credit needs\n\n\nPrivacy Rules.\n Federal banking regulators, as required under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. The rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to non-affiliated third parties. The privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors.\n\n\nThe NY DFS requires New York State-chartered or licensed banks regulated by the NY DFS, such as us, to adopt broad cybersecurity protections. In particular, we have established a program designed to ensure the safety of our information systems, adopted a written cybersecurity policy, and designated an information security officer. We are subject to ongoing compliance and reporting requirements of the NY DFS.\n\n\n-\n \n16\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAnti-Money Laundering and the USA Patriot Act.\n A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions is combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 substantially broadened the scope of U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Financial institutions are prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must use enhanced due diligence procedures in their dealings with certain types of high-risk customers and implement a written customer identification program. Financial institutions must take certain steps to assist government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and report certain types of suspicious transactions. Regulatory authorities routinely examine financial institutions for compliance with these obligations, and for the failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required. Regulatory authorities have imposed cease and desist orders and civil money penalties against institutions found to be violating these obligations.\n\n\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control Regulation.\n The U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes, under authority of various laws, including designated foreign countries, nationals and others. OFAC publishes lists of specially designated targets and countries. The Company is responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of, and transactions with, such targets and countries, prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required.\n\n\nInterstate Branching.\n Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, national and state-chartered banks may open an initial branch in a state other than its home state (e.g., a host state) by establishing a de novo branch at any location in such host state at which a bank chartered in such host state could establish a branch. Applications to establish such branches must still be filed with the appropriate primary federal regulator.\n\n\nTransactions with Affiliates.\n FII, FSB, Five Star REIT, SDN, Courier Capital, HNP Capital and CHIL are affiliates within the meaning of the Federal Reserve Act. The Federal Reserve Act imposes limitations on a bank with respect to extensions of credit to, investments in, and certain other transactions with, its parent financial holding company and the holding company\u2019s other subsidiaries. Furthermore, bank loans and extensions of credit to affiliates also are subject to various collateral requirements.\n\n\nVarious governmental requirements, including Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the FRB\u2019s Regulation W, limit borrowings by FII and its nonbank subsidiaries from FSB, and also limit various other transactions between FII and its nonbank subsidiaries, on the one hand, and FSB, on the other. For example, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institution\u2019s loans and other \u201ccovered transactions\u201d with any particular nonbank affiliate to no more than 10% of the institution\u2019s total capital and limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institution\u2019s covered transactions with all of its nonbank affiliates to no more than 20% of its total capital. \u201cCovered transactions\u201d are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit, as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the FRB) from the affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan, and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act also generally requires that an insured depository institution\u2019s loans to its nonbank affiliates be, at a minimum, 100% secured, and Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act generally requires that an insured depository institution\u2019s transactions with its nonbank affiliates be on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same or at least as favorable as those prevailing for comparable transactions with non-affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly expanded the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions within a banking organization. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act applies the 10% of capital limit on covered transactions to financial subsidiaries and amended the definition of \u201ccovered transaction\u201d to include (i) securities borrowing or lending transactions with an affiliate, and (ii) all derivatives transactions with an affiliate, to the extent that either causes a bank or its affiliate to have credit exposure to the securities borrowing/lending or derivative counterparty.\n\n\nInsurance Regulation.\n SDN is required to be licensed or receive regulatory approval in nearly every state in which it does business. In addition, most jurisdictions require individuals who engage in brokerage and certain other insurance service activities to be personally licensed. These licensing laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In most jurisdictions, licensing laws and regulations generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities to adopt and amend regulations and to supervise regulated activities.\n\n\nInvestment Advisory Regulation.\n Courier Capital and HNP Capital are providers of investment consulting and financial planning services and, as such, are each considered an \u201cinvestment adviser\u201d under the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cAdvisers Act\u201d). An investment adviser is any person or entity that provides advice to others, or that issues reports or analyses, regarding securities for compensation. While a FHC is generally excluded from regulation under the Advisers Act, the SEC has stated that this exclusion does not apply to investment adviser subsidiaries of FHCs, such as Courier Capital and HNP Capital. Because Courier Capital and HNP Capital each have over $100 million in assets under management, each is individually considered a \u201clarge adviser,\u201d which requires registration with the SEC by filing Form ADV, including Part 3 to Form ADV, or Form CRS, which discloses the material terms of the advisor\u2019s relationship with retail customers. Courier Capital and HNP Capital must update these forms at least once each year and more frequently under certain specified circumstances. This registration covers Courier Capital or HNP Capital and its\n \n\n\n-\n \n17\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nemployees as well as other persons under their control and supervision, such as independent contractors, provided that their activities are undertaken on behalf of Courier Capital or HNP Capital.\n\n\nIn addition to these registration requirements, the Advisers Act contains numerous other provisions that impose obligations on investment advisors. For example, Section 206 includes anti-fraud provisions that courts have interpreted as establishing fiduciary duties extending to all services undertaken on behalf of the client. These duties include, but are not limited to, the disclosure of all material facts to clients, providing only suitable investment advice, and seeking best price execution of trades. Section 206 also has specific rules relating to, among other things, advertising, safeguarding client assets, the engagement of third-parties, the duty to supervise persons acting on the investment adviser\u2019s behalf, and the establishment of an effective internal compliance program and a code of ethics.\n\n\nCourier Capital and HNP Capital are subject to each of these obligations and, as applicable, restrictions, and are also subject to examination by the SEC\u2019s Office of Compliance, Investigations, and Examinations to assess their overall compliance with the Advisers Act and the effectiveness of their internal controls.\n\n\nCommencing in October 2013, prior to the Parent\u2019s acquisition of Courier Capital and HNP Capital, the Bank entered into a partnership with LPL Financial, one of the nation\u2019s largest independent financial services companies (\u201cLPL\u201d), to provide investment advisory and broker-dealer services to the Bank\u2019s customers through LPL. This partnership continues and the Bank employs wealth advisors, who are licensed by LPL, to provide investment advisory and broker-dealer services to the Bank\u2019s customers. LPL is an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act and is subject to its provisions.\n\n\nIncentive Compensation.\n Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve. The Federal banking agencies\u2019 guidance on incentive compensation policies intend to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not encourage excessive risk-taking and undermine the safety and soundness of those organizations. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization\u2019s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization\u2019s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization\u2019s board of directors.\n\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal banking agencies to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total consolidated assets (which would include the Company and the Bank) that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. In addition, the agencies must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentive-based compensation arrangements. In May 2016, six federal agencies, including the FRB, the FDIC and the SEC, invited public comments on a proposed rule to accomplish this mandate; no final rule has since been issued, however, and it is uncertain at this time whether the agencies intend to further pursue the rule for the foreseeable future.\n\n\nThe FRB reviews, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not \u201clarge, complex banking organizations.\u201d These reviews are tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization\u2019s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives are included in reports of examination. Deficiencies are incorporated into the organization\u2019s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization\u2019s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization\u2019s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.\n\n\nOther Future Legislation and Changes in Regulations.\n In addition to the specific proposals described above, from time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of financial holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and/or our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. We cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on our financial condition or results of operations. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to us or our subsidiaries could have a material effect on our business.\n\n\nRegulatory and Economic Policies\n\n\nOur business and earnings are affected by general and local economic conditions and by the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. government, its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities. The FRB regulates the supply of money in order to influence general economic conditions. Among the instruments of monetary policy available to the FRB are (i) conducting open market operations in U.S. government obligations, (ii) changing the discount rate on financial institution borrowings, (iii) imposing or changing reserve requirements against financial institution deposits, and (iv) restricting certain borrowings and imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by financial institutions and their affiliates. These methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. For that reason, the policies of the FRB could have a material effect on our earnings.\n\n\n-\n \n18\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "item1a": ">ITEM 1A.    R\nISK FACTORS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAn investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent to our business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes could affect us are described below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference herein. This Annual Report on Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors set forth below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us.\n\n\nIf any of the following risks occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of our common stock could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\n\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\n\nGovernmental and individual efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic have introduced volatility into the U.S. and global economy which has and may continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic downturn in early 2020, the Federal Reserve reduced the target federal funds rate to a range of 0.00% to 0.25%. This lower rate reduces the rate of interest we earn on loans and pay on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can affect the value of financial instruments we hold. In an environment with lower interest rates, we will not be able to earn as much on our interest-earning assets, which may reduce net interest margin and our ability to earn interest and receive dividend income from investment securities will be reduced. While the FRB has indicated that it expects to raise the target federal funds rate in response to inflationary pressure and labor market challenges, we cannot assure you that interest rates will increase or that such an increase would increase our net income.\n\n\nSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been confronted with a significant and unfamiliar degree of uncertainty in estimating the impact of the pandemic on credit quality, revenues, and asset values. Our credit risk has fluctuated along with the changes in the U.S. economy: we increased our allowance for credit losses in early 2020 in response to higher unemployment levels, but in 2021, we experienced a benefit from the provision for credit losses as employment levels improved. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral, and we provide an allowance for credit losses based on a number of factors. We believe that the allowance for credit losses is adequate. However, if our assumptions or judgments are wrong, the allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover the actual credit losses. We may have to increase the allowance in the future in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting changes to the U.S. economy. The actual amount of future provisions for credit losses may vary from the amount of past provisions.\n \n\n\nIf the borrower of a PPP loan under the CARES Act fails to qualify for loan forgiveness under the program, we will have to hold the loan at an unfavorable interest rate as compared to a loan we may otherwise have extended to our customer. Even though those loans are guaranteed by the SBA, we may not be able to collect from the SBA as quickly as those payments come due, and our cash flow and earnings may be reduced accordingly. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which we originated, funded or serviced the PPP loan, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already made payment under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from us.\n\n\nAs a lender, we are exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans may not be sufficient to assure repayment. The collateral securing our indirect loan portfolio in particular may not be sufficient to cover the full value of an outstanding loan because the collateral, namely automobiles, are depreciating assets. If a significant proportion of our customers are unable to repay their loans and the collateral securing repayment is insufficient to cover our losses, we may have to increase our allowance for credit losses, the quality of our loan portfolio will decline, our net income will decrease, and our results of operations will be materially adversely impacted. In addition, our capital and leverage ratios may be adversely impacted.\n\n\nContinued economic disruption and fear of the spread of COVID-19 could result in business shutdowns, limitations on commercial activity and financial transactions, labor shortages, supply chain interruptions, increased unemployment and commercial property vacancy rates and reduced profitability and ability for property owners to make mortgage payments.\n\n\n-\n \n19\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe believe our most significant exposure to COVID\u201019-impacted businesses is within the following industries, representing the following percentage of commercial real estate and commercial loan balances as of December 31, 2021:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\nretail and retail building, 14%;\n\n\n\u2022\nhotel, motel and lodging, 4% ;\n\n\n\u2022\nhealth care, 3%;\n\n\n\u2022\nrestaurants and food services, 2%;\n\n\n\u2022\nentertainment and recreation, 2%; and\n\n\n\u2022\nmining, quarrying and oil & gas, less than 1%.\n\n\nWe have experienced charge-offs that were precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the $8.2 million charge-off of a $11.9 million commercial loan in the hotel, motel and lodging industry in the first quarter of 2020 and related foreclosure in the third quarter of 2020.  We may experience additional charge-offs or credit losses related to the COVID-19 pandemic and other economic disruptions.\n\n\nChanges in our operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have exposed us to additional risks.\n\n\nSocial distancing efforts imposed by state and local governments to address the COVID-19 pandemic caused us to change how we operate our bank branches, with the interior of some branches closing to customers when required to comply with state or local laws. In addition, to curb the spread of COVID-19, a significant proportion of our employees transitioned to working remotely. Both of these changes may slow response times to customers\u2019 inquiries or preclude providing the level of service our employees are typically able to offer in person. Our reputation and results of operations may be impacted if our competitors are better able to adjust to the restrictions on in-person interactions and remote work.\n\n\nFurthermore, as some of our employees continue to work from home, our operational risk, including data security risk, is higher than it would otherwise be, as cybercriminal activity has increased in an attempt to profit from the disruption to pre-pandemic operations. The cybersecurity-related risks we face include more phishing, malware, and other cybersecurity attacks, vulnerability to disruptions of our information technology infrastructure and telecommunications systems for remote operations, and unauthorized dissemination, misuse or destruction of confidential or valuable information.\n\n\nWe continue to follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\u201cCDC\u201d) guidelines and governmental mandates regarding COVID-19 protocols and vaccinations. While it is not possible to predict the administrative costs, compliance costs or impacts to our available workforce, we are developing compliance processes for implementing the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) testing and vaccination mandates while monitoring legal actions and state legislation regarding the mandates for further guidance.\n\n\nMandatory COVID-19 vaccination of employees could impact our workforce and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe imposition of government mandated vaccination or testing may impact our ability to retain current employees and attract new employees.  In the event of a vaccine mandate, some of our employees who are not vaccinated may seek exemptions or otherwise resist vaccination.  The imposition of vaccine mandates could potentially cause labor shortages if employees refuse to get vaccinated and their employment is terminated, either voluntarily or involuntarily. Although the previously proposed vaccine mandates provide for the alternative of weekly testing for the virus and allow employers to shift the cost burden of this testing to employees, labor markets, competitive forces, and practical application may dictate that we would shoulder the cost of such testing, which could result in meaningful costs that have not been incurred to date. If federal, state or local mandates take effect, those mandates may result in employee attrition, which could adversely affect revenues and costs and could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\n\nCredit Risks and Risks Related to Banking Activities\n\n\nIf we experience greater credit losses than anticipated, earnings may be adversely impacted.\n\n\nAs a lender, we are exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans may not be sufficient to assure repayment. Credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\n\n\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral, and we provide an allowance for estimated credit losses based on a number of factors. We believe that the allowance for credit losses is adequate. However, if our assumptions or judgments are wrong, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover the actual credit losses. We may have to increase the allowance in the future in response to the request of one of our primary banking regulators, to adjust for changing conditions and assumptions, or as\n \n\n\n-\n \n20\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\na result of any deterioration in the quality of our loan portfolio. The actual amount of future provisions for credit losses may vary from the amount of past provisions.\n\n\nGeographic concentration may unfavorably impact our operations.\n\n\nSubstantially all of our operations are concentrated in the Western and Central New York region. As a result of this geographic concentration, our results depend largely on economic conditions in these and surrounding areas. Deterioration in economic conditions in our market could:\n\n\n\u2022\nincrease loan delinquencies;\n\n\n\u2022\nincrease problem assets and foreclosures;\n\n\n\u2022\nincrease claims and lawsuits;\n\n\n\u2022\ndecrease the demand for our products and services; and\n\n\n\u2022\ndecrease the value of collateral for loans, especially real estate, reducing customers\u2019 borrowing power, the value of assets associated with non-performing loans and collateral coverage.\n\n\nGenerally, we make loans to small to mid-sized businesses whose success depends on the regional economy. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities. Adverse economic and business conditions in our market areas, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could reduce our growth rate, affect our borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans and, consequently, adversely affect our business, financial condition and performance. For example, we place substantial reliance on real estate as collateral for our loan portfolio. A sharp downturn in real estate values in our market area could leave many of these loans inadequately collateralized. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, the impact on our results of operations could be materially adverse.\n\n\nOur commercial business and mortgage loans increase our exposure to credit risks.\n\n\nAt December 31, 2021, our portfolio of commercial business and mortgage loans totaled $2.05 billion, or 56% of total loans. We plan to continue to emphasize the origination of these types of loans, which generally expose us to a greater risk of nonpayment and loss than residential real estate or consumer loans because repayment of such loans often depends on the successful operations and income stream of the borrowers. Additionally, such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to consumer loans or residential real estate loans. A sudden downturn in the economy, or a prolonged downturn for specific industries, could result in borrowers being unable to repay their loans, thus exposing us to increased credit risk.\n\n\nOur indirect and consumer lending involves risk elements in addition to normal credit risk.\n\n\nA portion of our current lending involves the purchase of consumer automobile installment sales contracts from automobile dealers located in Western, Central and the Capital District of New York, and Northern and Central Pennsylvania. These loans are for the purchase of new or used automobiles. We serve customers that cover a range of creditworthiness, and the required terms and rates are reflective of those risk profiles. While these loans have higher yields than many of our other loans, such loans involve risk elements in addition to normal credit risk. Additional risk elements associated with indirect lending include the limited personal contact with the borrower as a result of indirect lending through non-bank channels, namely automobile dealers. While indirect automobile loans are secured, such loans are secured by depreciating assets and characterized by loan-to-value ratios that could result in us not recovering the full value of an outstanding loan upon default by the borrower. If the losses from our indirect loan portfolio are higher than anticipated, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our consumer lending activities are subject to numerous consumer protection laws and regulations, and if we were unable to comply with the regulations applicable to our consumer lending activities, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\n\n\nLack of seasoning in portions of our loan portfolio could increase risk of credit defaults in the future.\n\n\nAs a result of our growth over the past several years, certain portions of our loan portfolio, such as the increased size of our commercial loan portfolio and in particular the PPP loans we originated, are of relatively recent origin. Loans may not begin to show signs of credit deterioration or default until they have been outstanding for some period of time, a process referred to as \u201cseasoning.\u201d As a result, a portfolio of older loans will usually behave more predictably than a newer portfolio. Because these portions of our portfolio are relatively new, the current level of delinquencies and defaults may not represent the level that may prevail as the portfolio becomes more seasoned. If delinquencies and defaults increase, we may be required to increase our provision for loan losses, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n-\n \n21\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe accept deposits that do not have a fixed term and which may be withdrawn by the customer at any time for any reason.\n\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we had $3.91 billion of deposit liabilities that have no maturity and, therefore, may be withdrawn by the depositor at any time. These deposit liabilities include our checking, savings, and money market deposit accounts.\n\n\nMarket conditions may impact the competitive landscape for deposits in the banking industry. The low rate environment and future actions the Federal Reserve may take may impact pricing and demand for deposits in the banking industry. The withdrawal of more deposits than we anticipate could have an adverse impact on our profitability as this source of funding, if not replaced by similar deposit funding, would need to be replaced with wholesale funding, the sale of interest-earning assets, or a combination of these two actions. The replacement of deposit funding with wholesale funding could cause our overall cost of funding to increase, which would reduce our net interest income. A loss of interest-earning assets could also reduce our net interest income.\n\n\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with our lending activities.\n\n\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. There is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on properties we have foreclosed upon. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage regardless of whether we knew, had reason to know of, or caused the release of such substance. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and market area.\n\n\nWe face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources than us. Such competitors primarily include national, regional and internet banks within the markets in which we operate. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including, without limitation, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting), and merchant banking. Technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. More recently, peer to peer lending has emerged as an alternative borrowing source for our customers and many other non-banks offer lending and payment services, such as consumer credit through buy now - pay later offerings, in competition with banks. Many of these competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many of our larger competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services than we can at competitive prices or with low or no fees.\n\n\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among other things:\n\n\n\u2022\nthe ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets;\n\n\n\u2022\nthe ability to expand our market position;\n\n\n\u2022\nthe scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands;\n\n\n\u2022\nthe rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors;\n\n\n\u2022\ncustomer satisfaction with our level of service; and\n\n\n\u2022\nindustry and general economic trends.\n\n\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n-\n \n22\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nChanges to and replacement of the LIBOR Benchmark Interest Rate may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, a regulator of financial services firms and financial markets in the United Kingdom, stated that it will only support the regulatory oversight of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") interest rate indices through 2021. This announcement, and, more generally, financial benchmark reforms and changes in the interbank lending markets, have resulted in uncertainty about the interest rate benchmarks that will be used in the future. In the United States, efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates are ongoing, and the Alternative Reference Rate Committee formally recommended the use of a Secured Overnight Funding Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). SOFR is different from LIBOR in that it is a retrospective-looking secured rate rather than a forward-looking unsecured rate. These differences could lead to a greater disconnect between our and the Bank\u2019s costs to raise funds for SOFR as compared to LIBOR. In addition to the discontinuance of LIBOR, there may be future changes in the rules or methodologies used to calculate SOFR or other benchmarks, which may have a material adverse effect on the value of or return on our financial assets and liabilities that are based on or are linked to LIBOR and other benchmarks. Once LIBOR rates are no longer available, and we are required to implement replacement reference rates for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements with borrowers, we may incur significant expense in effecting the transition and we may be subject to disputes or litigation with our borrowers over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the replacement reference rates. The transition date for existing LIBOR loan contracts is currently set as June 30, 2023 and impacts loans that have not yet matured or have been refinanced by that date.  The uncertainty related to these changes may have an unpredictable impact on the financial markets and could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\n\n\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\n\n\nLegal and regulatory proceedings and related matters could adversely affect us and the banking industry in general.\n\n\nWe have been, and may in the future be, subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings, including class action litigation. It is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters, and there can be no assurance that we will prevail in any proceeding or litigation. Legal and regulatory matters of any degree of significance could result in substantial cost and diversion of our efforts, which by itself could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\n \n\n\nAs disclosed in Part I, Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings,\u201d an action has been brought against us by four individuals who sought and were granted class certification to represent classes of consumers who allege to have obtained direct or indirect financing from us for the purchase of vehicles that we later repossessed. On September 30, 2021, the court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification and certified four different classes (two classes of New York consumers and two classes of Pennsylvania consumers). There are approximately 5,200 members in the New York classes and approximately 300 members in the Pennsylvania classes. If we settle these claims or the litigation is not resolved in our favor, we may suffer reputational damage and incur legal costs, settlements or judgments that exceed the amounts covered by our existing insurance policies. We can provide no assurances that our insurer will insure the legal costs, settlements or judgements we incur in excess of our deductible. If we are not successful in defending ourselves from these claims, or if our insurer does not insure us against legal costs we incur in excess of our deductible, the result may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, adverse determinations in such matters could result in actions by our regulators that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. There can be no guarantee that proceedings that may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition will not arise in the near or long-term future.\n \n\n\nWe establish reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. We may still incur legal costs for a matter even if we have not established a reserve. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, the actual cost of resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for that matter. The ultimate resolution of a pending legal proceeding, depending on the remedy sought and granted, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n\nAny future FDIC insurance premium increases may adversely affect our earnings.\n\n\nThe amount that is assessed by the FDIC for deposit insurance is set by the FDIC based on a variety of factors. These include the depositor insurance fund\u2019s reserve ratio, the Bank\u2019s assessment base, which is equal to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, and various inputs into the FDIC\u2019s assessment rate calculation.\n\n\nIf there are financial institution failures, we may be required to pay higher FDIC premiums. Such increases of FDIC insurance premiums may adversely impact our earnings. See the section captioned \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d included in Part I, Item 1 \u201cBusiness\u201d for more information about FDIC insurance premiums.\n\n\n-\n \n23\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe are highly regulated, and any adverse regulatory action may result in additional costs, loss of business opportunities, and reputational damage.\n\n\nAs described in the section captioned \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d included in Part I, Item 1, \u201cBusiness,\u201d we are subject to extensive supervision, regulation and examination. The various regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over us have significant latitude in addressing our compliance with applicable laws and regulations including, but not limited to, those governing consumer credit, fair lending, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, capital adequacy, asset quality and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors affecting us. As part of this regulatory structure, we are subject to policies and other guidance developed by the regulatory agencies with respect to, among other things, capital levels, the timing and amount of dividend payments, the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Our regulators have broad discretion to impose monetary fines or restrictions and limitations on our operations if they determine, for any reason, that our operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies.\n \n\n\nThis supervisory framework could materially impact the conduct, growth and profitability of our operations. Any failure on our part to comply with current laws, regulations, other regulatory requirements or safe and sound banking, insurance, or investment advisory practices or concerns about our financial condition, or any related regulatory sanctions or adverse actions against us, could increase our costs or restrict our ability to expand our business and result in damage to our reputation.\n\n\nAdditionally, shareholder activism and potential regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, including with respect to environmental, social, and governance matters, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways that may materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n\nThe policies of the Federal Reserve have a significant impact on our earnings.\n\n\nThe policies of the Federal Reserve impact us significantly. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its policies directly and indirectly influence the rate of interest earned on loans and paid on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of financial instruments we hold. Those policies determine, to a significant extent, our cost of funds for lending and investing and impact our net interest income, our primary source of revenue. Changes in those policies are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Federal Reserve policies can also affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. For example, a tightening of the money supply by the Federal Reserve could reduce the demand for a borrower\u2019s products and services. This could adversely affect the borrower\u2019s earnings and ability to repay its loan, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\nRisks Related to Non-Banking Activities\n\n\nOur insurance brokerage subsidiary is subject to risk related to the insurance industry.\n\n\nSDN derives the bulk of its revenue from commissions and fees earned from brokerage services. SDN does not determine the insurance premiums on which its commissions are based. Insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions. As a result, insurance brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile. As insurance companies outsource the production of premium revenue to non-affiliated brokers or agents such as SDN, those insurance companies may seek to further minimize their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers, which could adversely affect SDN\u2019s revenues.    In addition, there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including, among other things, increased use of self-insurance, captives, and risk retention groups. While SDN has been able to participate in certain of these activities and earn fees for such services, there can be no assurance that we will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from SDN\u2019s traditional brokerage activities.\n\n\nOur investment advisory and wealth management operations are subject to risk related to the regulation of the financial services industry and market volatility.\n\n\nThe financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state levels. It is very difficult to predict the future impact of the legislative and regulatory requirements affecting our business. The securities laws and other laws that govern the activities of our registered investment advisor are complex and subject to change. The activities of our investment advisory and wealth management operations are subject primarily to provisions of the Advisers Act and the Employee Retirement Income Act of 1940, as amended (\u201cERISA\u201d). We are a fiduciary under ERISA. Our investment advisory services are also subject to state laws including anti-fraud laws and regulations.\n \n\n\n-\n \n24\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn addition, the broker-dealer services provided by Courier Capital and HNP Capital are subject to Regulation Best Interest, which requires a broker-dealer to act in the best interest of a retail customer when making a recommendation to that customer of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities. The regulation imposes heightened standards on broker-dealers and will require us to review and modify the policies and procedures of our wealth management operations, as well as associated supervisory and compliance controls.\n\n\nAny claim of noncompliance, regardless of merit or ultimate outcome, could subject us to investigation by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Our compliance processes may not be sufficient to prevent assertions that we failed to comply with any applicable law, rule or regulation. If our investment advisory and wealth management operations are subject to investigation by the SEC or other regulatory authorities or if litigation is brought by clients based on our failure to comply with applicable regulations, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\n\n\nOur investment advisory revenue may decrease as a result of poor investment performance, in either relative or absolute terms, which could decrease our revenues and net income.\n \n\n\nOur investment advisory business derives a significant amount of its revenues from investment management fees based on assets under management.  Our ability to maintain or increase assets under management is subject to a number of factors, including our clients' evaluation of the past performance of our investment advisory business, in either relative or absolute terms, general market and economic conditions, and competition from other investment management firms.  A decline in the fair value of the assets under management would decrease our investment advisory revenue.\n\n\nInvestment performance is one of the most important factors in retaining existing investment advisory clients and competing for new investment advisory clients.  Poor investment performance could reduce our investment advisory revenues and impede the growth of our investment advisory business in the following ways: existing clients may withdraw funds from our investment advisory business in favor of better performing products or firms; asset-based management fees could decline from a decrease in assets under management; our ability to attract funds from existing and new clients might diminish; and the investment advisory personnel may depart to join a competitor or otherwise.\n\n\nStrategic and Operational Risks\n \n\n\nWe make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements that may prove to be incorrect, which could significantly impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and we are subject to new or changing accounting rules and interpretations, and the failure by us to correctly interpret or apply these evolving rules and interpretations could have a material adverse effect.\n\n\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States require us to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including in determining credit loss reserves and reserves related to litigation, among other items. Certain of our financial instruments, including available-for-sale securities and certain loans, require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our financial statements. Where quoted market prices are not available, we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means, which ultimately rely to some degree on management judgment. Some of these and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable price levels, making their valuation particularly subjective, as they are based on significant estimation and judgment. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment. If assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience material losses that would impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n\nAs indicated in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations underlying GAAP are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time. In particular, effective January 1, 2020, we have implemented FASB\u2019s Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, \nFinancial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses (Topic 326) \u2013 Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\n, which requires us to recognize an allowance for credit losses based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts, as opposed to recognizing an allowance when it is probable that a loss has been incurred. This change in GAAP increased our allowance for credit losses and created more volatility in the level of our allowance for credit losses, and has been, and will continue to be, impacted by the Company\u2019s loan and securities portfolios\u2019 composition, attributes and quality. If we fail to interpret any one or more of these GAAP provisions correctly, or if our methodology in applying them to our financial reporting or disclosures is at all flawed, our financial statements may contain inaccuracies that, if severe enough, could warrant a later restatement by us, which in turn could result in a material adverse event.\n\n\n-\n \n25\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe value of our goodwill and other intangible assets may decline in the future.\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $67.1 million of goodwill and $7.3 million of other intangible assets. Significant and sustained declines in our stock price and market capitalization, significant declines in our expected future cash flows, significant adverse changes in the business climate or slower growth rates may necessitate our taking charges in the future related to the impairment of our goodwill. Future regulatory actions could also have a material impact on assessments of goodwill for impairment. If the fair value of our net assets improves at a faster rate than the market value of our reporting units, or if we were to experience increases in book values of a reporting unit in excess of the increase in fair value of equity, we may also have to take charges related to the impairment of our goodwill. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of our goodwill is necessary, we would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\n\nIdentifiable intangible assets other than goodwill consist of core deposit intangibles and other intangible assets (primarily customer relationships). Adverse events or circumstances could impact the recoverability of these intangible assets including loss of core deposits, significant losses of customer accounts and/or balances, increased competition or adverse changes in the economy. To the extent these intangible assets are deemed unrecoverable, a non-cash impairment charge would be recorded which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\n\nWe may be unable to successfully implement our growth strategies, including the integration and successful management of newly-acquired businesses.\n\n\nOur current growth strategy is multi-faceted. We seek to expand our branch network into nearby areas, continue to invest in our digital banking strategy, develop new sustainable revenue streams through Banking as a Service (BaaS), make strategic acquisitions of loans, portfolios, other regional banks and non-banking firms whose businesses we feel may be complementary with ours, and to continue to organically grow our core deposits. Any failure by us to effectively implement any one or more of these growth strategies could have several negative effects, including a possible decline in the size or the quality, or both, of our loan portfolio or a decrease in profitability caused by an increase in operating expenses.\n\n\nWe hope to continue an active merger and acquisition strategy. However, even if we use our common stock as the predominant form of consideration, we may need to raise capital to negotiate a transaction on terms acceptable to us and there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise a sufficient amount of capital to enable us to complete an acquisition. It is also possible that even with adequate capital we may still be unable to complete an acquisition on favorable terms, causing us to miss opportunities to increase our earnings and expand or diversify our operations.\n\n\nOur growth strategy is also dependent upon the successful integration of new businesses and any future acquisitions into our existing operations. While our senior management team has had extensive experience in acquisitions and post-acquisition integration, there is no guarantee that our current or future integration efforts will be successful, and if our senior management is forced to spend a disproportionate amount of time on integrating recently-acquired businesses, it may distract their attention from operating our business or pursuing other growth opportunities.\n\n\nAcquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value.\n\n\nWe intend to continue to pursue a growth strategy for our business by expanding our branch network into communities within or complementary to markets where we currently conduct business. We may consider acquisitions of loans or securities portfolios, lending or leasing firms, commercial and small business lenders, residential lenders, direct banks, banks or bank branches, wealth and investment management firms, securities brokerage firms, specialty finance or other financial services-related companies. We also intend to expand our non-banking subsidiaries, SDN, Courier Capital and HNP Capital, by acquiring smaller insurance agencies, such as Landmark and North Woods and wealth management firms in areas which complement our current footprint. We may be unsuccessful in expanding our non-banking subsidiaries through acquisition because of the growing interest in acquiring insurance brokers and wealth management firms, which could make it more difficult for us to identify appropriate targets and could make such acquisitions more expensive. Even if we are able to identify appropriate acquisition targets, we may not have sufficient capital to fund acquisitions or be able to execute transactions on favorable terms. If we are unable to pursue our growth strategy, we may not be able to achieve all of the expected benefits of our historical acquisitions, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n\nAcquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves potential adverse impact to our financial results and various other risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:\n\n\n\u2022\ndifficulty in estimating the value of the target company;\n\n\n\u2022\npayment of a premium over book and market values that may dilute our tangible book value and earnings per share in the short and long term;\n\n\n\u2022\npotential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company;\n\n\n\u2022\nexposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company;\n\n\n\u2022\nvolatility in reported income as goodwill impairment losses could occur irregularly and in varying amounts;\n\n\n\u2022\nchallenge and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company;\n\n\n\u2022\ninability to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and other projected benefits;\n\n\n\u2022\npotential disruption to our business;\n\n\n-\n \n26\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u2022\npotential diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention;\n\n\n\u2022\nthe possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company;\n\n\n\u2022\npotential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company; and\n\n\n\u2022\nadditional regulatory burdens associated with new lines of business.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOur tax strategies and the value of our deferred tax assets and liabilities could adversely affect our operating results and regulatory capital ratios.\n\n\nOur tax strategies are dependent upon our ability to generate taxable income in future periods. Our tax strategies will be less effective in the event we fail to generate taxable income. Our deferred tax assets are subject to an evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized for financial statement purposes. In making this determination, we consider all positive and negative evidence available including the impact of recent operating results, reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies and projected earnings within the statutory tax loss carryover period. If we were to conclude that a significant portion of our deferred tax assets were not more likely than not to be realized, the required valuation allowance could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and regulatory capital ratios. In addition, the value of our deferred tax assets could be adversely affected by a change in statutory rates.\n\n\nLiquidity is essential to our businesses.\n\n\nOur liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access the capital markets or unforeseen outflows of cash. Reduced liquidity may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties or us. Our efforts to monitor and manage liquidity risk may not be successful or sufficient to deal with dramatic or unanticipated reductions in our liquidity. In such events, our cost of funds may increase, thereby reducing our net interest income, or we may need to sell a portion of our investment and/or loan portfolio, which, depending upon market conditions, could result in us realizing a loss.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for most of our revenue.\n\n\nWe are a separate and distinct legal entity from our subsidiaries. A substantial portion of our revenue comes from dividends from our Bank subsidiary. These dividends are the principal source of funds we use to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock, and to pay interest and principal on our debt. Federal and/or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that our Bank subsidiary may pay to us. Also, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors. In the event our Bank subsidiary is unable to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to service debt, pay obligations, or pay dividends on our common and preferred stock. The inability to receive dividends from our Bank subsidiary could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n\nIf our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer losses.\n\n\nOur risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor and report the types of risk to which we are subject, including credit risk, operations risk, compliance risk, reputation risk, strategic risk, market risk, and liquidity risk. We seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a framework of policies, procedures and reporting requirements. Management of our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical and/or forecasting models. If the models used to mitigate these risks are inadequate, we may incur losses. In addition, there may be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.\n\n\nNegative public opinion could damage our reputation and impact business operations and revenues.\n\n\nAs a financial institution, our earnings and capital are subject to risk associated with negative public opinion.  Negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, the failure of any of our products or services to meet our clients' expectations or applicable regulatory requirements, corporate governance and acquisitions, social media and other marketing activities, the implementation of environmental, social and governance practices or actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to any of the foregoing.  Negative public opinion could affect our ability to attract and/or retain clients, could expose us to litigation and regulatory action, and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price or result in heightened volatility.  Negative public opinion could also affect our ability to borrow funds in the unsecured wholesale debt markets.\n \n\n\n-\n \n27\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTechnology and Cybersecurity Risks\n\n\nWe face competition in staying current with technological changes and banking alternatives to compete and meet customer demands.\n\n\nThe financial services market, including banking services, faces rapid changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Our future success may depend, in part, on our ability to use technology to provide products and services that provide convenience to customers and to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements than we currently have. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. In addition, technology and other changes are allowing consumers to utilize alternative methods to complete financial transactions that have historically involved banks. For example, consumers can now maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and transferring funds directly without using a traditional bank as an intermediary. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries could result in the loss of customer deposits, the related income generated from those deposits and additional fee income. We may not be able to effectively compete with these banking alternatives for consumer deposits. As a result, our ability to effectively compete to retain or acquire new business may be impaired, and our business, financial condition or results of operations, may be adversely affected.\n\n\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\n\n\nThird party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections, network access and core application processing. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including as a result of them not providing us their services for any reason or them performing their services poorly, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers or otherwise conduct our business efficiently and effectively. Replacing these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.\n\n\nThird parties perform significant operational services on our behalf. These third-party vendors are subject to similar risks as us relating to cybersecurity, breakdowns or failures of their own systems or employees. One or more of our vendors may experience a cybersecurity event or operational disruption and, if any such event does occur, it may not be adequately addressed, either operationally or financially, by the third-party vendor. Certain of our vendors may have limited indemnification obligations or may not have the financial capacity to satisfy their indemnification obligations. Financial or operational difficulties of a vendor could also impair our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor\u2019s ability to serve us. If a critical vendor is unable to meet our needs in a timely manner or if the services or products provided by such a vendor are terminated or otherwise delayed and if we are not able to develop alternative sources for these services and products quickly and cost-effectively, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. Federal banking regulators have proposed rules on managing the risks of how banks select, engage and manage their outside vendors and issued voluntary guidance for banks on similar issues. These regulations and guidance may affect the circumstances and conditions under which we work with third parties and the cost of managing such relationships.\n\n\nA breach in security of our or third party information systems, including the occurrence of a cyber incident or a deficiency in cybersecurity, or a failure by us to comply with New York State cybersecurity regulations, may subject us to liability, result in a loss of customer business or damage our brand image.\n\n\nWe rely heavily on communications, information systems (both internal and provided by third parties) and the internet to conduct our business. Our business depends on our ability to process and monitor a large volume of daily transactions in compliance with legal, regulatory and internal standards and specifications. In addition, a significant portion of our operations relies heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of personal and confidential information of our customers and clients. These risks may increase in the future as our customers continue to adapt to mobile payment and other internet-based product offerings and we expand the availability of web-based products and applications.\n\n\nIn addition, several U.S. financial institutions have experienced significant distributed denial-of-service attacks, some of which involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to disable or degrade service or sabotage systems. Other potential attacks have attempted to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information or destroy data, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means. Such security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including persons who are involved with organized crime or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. These cybersecurity concerns are further heightened due to the recent Russian invasion into Ukraine.  Those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients. We are also subject to the risk that our employees may intercept and transmit unauthorized confidential or proprietary information. An interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability, remediation costs, regulatory action and reputational harm, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n\nWe are subject to cybersecurity regulations promulgated by the NY DFS. Any failure by us to comply with these regulations could also result in regulatory sanctions, public disclosure and reputational damage even if we do not experience a significant cybersecurity breach.\n\n\n-\n \n28\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFurthermore, as the threat of cyber attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our systems, or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities in our systems. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems, the process of enhancing our systems can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues.\n \n\n\nMarket Risks\n \n\n\nWe are subject to interest rate risk, and a rising rate environment may reduce our income and result in higher defaults on our loans, whereas a falling rate environment may result in earlier loan prepayments than we expect, which may reduce our income.\n\n\nOur earnings and cash flows depend largely upon our net interest income. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of governmental and regulatory agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and investments and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (i) our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits; (ii) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities; and (iii) the average duration of our mortgage-backed securities portfolio and other interest-earning assets.\n \n\n\nIf the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. In addition, our net interest margin may contract in a rising rate environment because our funding costs may increase faster than the yield we earn on our interest-earning assets. In a rising rate environment, loans with adjustable interest rates are more likely to experience a higher rate of default. The combination of these events may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\nEarnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. In addition, in a falling rate environment or the recent environment where the Federal Reserve has held the federal reference rate near 0.00%, loans may be prepaid sooner than we expect, which could result in a delay between when we receive the prepayment and when we are able to redeploy the funds into new interest-earning assets and in a decrease in the amount of interest income we are able to earn on those assets. If we are unable to manage these risks effectively, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\n\n\nAny substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Also, our interest rate risk modeling techniques and assumptions likely may not fully predict or capture the impact of actual interest rate changes on our balance sheet.\n\n\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\n\n\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due us. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future and such capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\n\n\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on our financial performance and, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which is outside of our control.\n\n\nIn addition, we are highly regulated, and our regulators could require us to raise additional common equity in the future. We and our regulators perform a variety of analyses of our assets, including the preparation of stress case scenarios, and as a result of those assessments we could determine, or our regulators could require us, to raise additional capital.\n\n\nWe may not be able to access required capital on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers, depositors of the Bank or counterparties participating in the capital markets, or a downgrade of our debt rating, may adversely affect our capital costs and ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\n\n\n-\n \n29\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\n\n\nWe may not pay or may reduce the dividends on our common stock.\n\n\nHolders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future. This could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\n\n\nWe may issue debt and equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, any of which may be senior to our common stock as to distributions and in liquidation, which could dilute our current shareholders or negatively affect the value of our common stock.\n\n\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by entering into debt or debt-like financing that is unsecured or secured by all or up to all of our assets, or by issuing additional debt or equity securities, which could include issuances of secured or unsecured commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior notes, subordinated notes, preferred stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities. In the event of our liquidation, our lenders and holders of our debt and preferred securities would receive a distribution of our available assets before distributions to the holders of our common stock. For example, our outstanding shares of Series A 3% and Series B-1 8.48% Preferred Stock have a preferential right to receive dividends before holders of our common stock. We must declare and pay annual dividends of $3 per share to Series A 3% Preferred Stock holders and of $8.48 per share to Series B-1 8.48% Preferred Stock holders before any dividends or dissolution payments can be paid to holders of common stock. Because our decision to incur debt and issue securities in our future offerings will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings and debt financings. Further, market conditions could require us to accept less favorable terms for the issuance of our securities in the future. We may also issue additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock that could dilute our current shareholders and effect the value of our common stock.\n\n\nOur certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, and certain banking laws may have an anti-takeover effect.\n\n\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, and federal and state banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders. The combination of these provisions may discourage others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\n\n\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors.\n\n\nOur quarterly and annual operating results have varied in the past and could vary significantly in the future, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. Our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including the changing U.S. economic environment and changes in the commercial and residential real estate market, any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate. If our operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things:\n\n\n\u2022\nvolatility of stock market prices and volumes in general;\n\n\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\n\n\u2022\nchanges in conditions in credit markets;\n\n\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting policies or procedures as required by the FASB or other regulatory agencies;\n\n\n\u2022\nlegislative and regulatory actions subjecting us to additional or different regulatory oversight which may result in increased compliance costs and/or require us to change our business model;\n\n\n\u2022\ngovernment intervention in the U.S. financial system and the effects of and changes in trade and monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board;\n\n\n\u2022\npolitical instability and uncertainty, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine;\n\n\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key members of management;\n\n\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results; and\n\n\n\u2022\nchanges in analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance.\n\n\n-\n \n30\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\n\nWe may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\n \n\n\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain skilled people. Competition for highly talented people can be intense, and we may not be able to hire sufficiently skilled people or retain them. Further, the rural location of our principal executive offices and many of our bank branches make it challenging for us to attract skilled people to such locations. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, knowledge of our markets, years of industry experience, and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\n\n\nWe use financial models for business planning purposes that may not adequately predict future results.\n\n\nWe use financial models to aid in planning for various purposes including our capital and liquidity needs, interest rate risk, potential charge-offs, reserves, and other purposes. The models used may not accurately account for all variables that could affect future results, may fail to predict outcomes accurately and/or may overstate or understate certain effects. As a result of these potential failures, we may not adequately prepare for future events and may suffer losses or other setbacks due to these failures.\n\n\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about or from customers and counterparties.\n\n\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports, and other financial information. We may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties, or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports, or other financial information could cause us to enter into unfavorable transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\nOur business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.\n\n\nOur financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services we offer, is highly dependent on the business environment in the markets where we operate, in the State of New York and in the United States as a whole. The acts of war in Ukraine and the impact of sanctions on Russia and Russian companies may impact global markets, which may create unfavorable or uncertain economic conditions.  A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment, natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors. The occurrence of any of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\nSevere weather, natural disasters, public health emergencies and pandemics, acts of war or terrorism, and other external events could significantly impact our business.\n\n\nSevere weather, natural disasters, public health emergencies and pandemics, acts of war or terrorism, and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the operations of our bank branches, stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue, and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. The occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "item7": ">ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS O\nF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the information set forth under Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisks Factors,\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing under Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\nFinancial Institutions, Inc. (the \u201cParent\u201d and together with all its subsidiaries, \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d), is a financial holding company headquartered in New York State. We offer a broad array of deposit, lending, and other financial services to individuals, municipalities and businesses in Western and Central New York through our wholly-owned New York-chartered banking subsidiary, Five Star Bank (the \u201cBank\u201d). Our indirect lending network includes relationships with franchised automobile dealers in Western and Central New York, the Capital District of New York and Northern and Central Pennsylvania. We offer insurance services through our wholly-owned subsidiary, SDN Insurance Agency, LLC (\u201cSDN\u201d), a full-service insurance agency. We offer customized investment advice, wealth management, investment consulting and retirement plan services through our wholly-owned subsidiaries Courier Capital, LLC (\u201cCourier Capital\u201d) and HNP Capital, LLC (\u201cHNP Capital\u201d), SEC-registered investment advisory and wealth management firms.  In addition, we offer Banking as a Service and Fintech solutions through our wholly-owned subsidiary Corn Hill Innovation Labs, LLC (\u201cCHIL\u201d).\n\n\nOur primary sources of revenue are net interest income (interest earned on our loans and securities, net of interest paid on deposits and other funding sources) and noninterest income, particularly fees and other revenue from insurance, investment advisory and financial services provided to customers or ancillary services tied to loans and deposits. Business volumes and pricing drive revenue potential, and tend to be influenced by overall economic factors, including market interest rates, business spending, consumer confidence, economic growth, and competitive conditions within the marketplace. We are not able to predict market interest rate fluctuations with certainty and our asset/liability management strategy may not prevent interest rate changes from having a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n\n\n2021 Financial Performance Review\n\n\nNet income increased $39.4 million to $77.7 million for 2021, compared to $38.3 million for 2020. This resulted in a 1.46% return on average assets and a 16.01% return on average equity. Net income available to common shareholders was $76.2 million or $4.78 per diluted share for 2021, compared to $36.9 million or $2.30 per diluted share for 2020. We declared cash dividends of $1.08 per common share during 2021, an increase of $0.04 per common share or 4% compared to the prior year.\n\n\nReflected in the increase in net income was an $8.3 million benefit for credit losses in the current year as compared to a provision of $27.2 million in 2020. Improvement in the national unemployment forecast, positive trends in qualitative factors, a reduction in specific reserves and lower net charge-offs resulted in the release of overall credit loss reserves and a corresponding benefit for credit losses in each quarter of 2021. Results for 2020 were negatively impacted by a higher than historical provision for credit losses, driven by the adoption of the current expected credit loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) standard and uncertainty around the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economic environment.\n\n\nFully-taxable equivalent net interest income was $155.4 million in 2021, an increase of $15.5 million, or 11%, compared to 2020. The increase was the result of a $603.5 million, or 14% increase in average interest-earning assets, partially offset by an eight-basis point decrease in the net interest margin, to 3.14%.\n\n\nThe provision for credit losses - loans was a benefit of $7.0 million in 2021 compared to a provision of $26.2 million in 2020. Net charge-offs decreased $8.1 million from the prior year to $5.8 million in 2021. Net charge-offs were an annualized 0.16% of average loans in the current year compared to 0.40% in 2020. Non-performing loans increased $2.7 million to $12.2 million compared to a year ago and represented 0.33% of total loans at December 31, 2021.\n\n\nNoninterest income totaled $46.9 million for the full year 2021, an increase of $3.7 million, or 9%, when compared to the prior year. The increase is primarily attributed to increases in investment advisory income, investments in limited partnerships and insurance income, partially offset by decreases in income from derivatives instruments, and net gain on investment securities. The increase in investment advisory income of $2.1 million was primarily due to an increase in assets under management driven by a combination of market gains, new customer accounts and contributions to existing accounts. Income from investments in limited partnerships increased $2.0 million compared to the prior year based on performance of the underlying investments. The increase in insurance income of $1.3 million was driven by the two 2021 bolt-on acquisitions (North Woods Capital Benefits LLC in August and Landmark Group in February) and growth in the legacy SDN business, including the impact of increasing insurance premiums. Income from derivative instruments, net was $2.8 million lower than the prior year, primarily due to the execution of fewer swap transactions in 2021.\n \n\n\n-\n \n36\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNoninterest expense for the full year 2021 totaled $112.8 million, a $3.5 million increase compared to $109.3 million in the prior year.  Computer and data processing expense increased $2.5 million year-over-year, as a result of strategic investments in technology, including digital banking initiatives and a customer relationship management solution that was deployed across all lines of business late in 2021. Salaries and benefits expense increased $1.6 million year-over-year, primarily due to higher performance-based incentive compensation and commissions, investments in personnel and the impact of 2021 acquisitions.\n \n\n\nIncome tax expense for the year was $19.5 million, representing an effective tax rate of 20.1% compared to an effective tax rate of 16.2% in 2020. The year-over-year increase in effective tax rate is primarily the result of higher pre-tax earnings in comparison to the prior year. Effective tax rates are impacted by items of income and expense not subject to federal or state taxation. The Company\u2019s effective tax rates differ from statutory rates primarily because of interest income from tax-exempt securities, earnings on company owned life insurance and tax credit investments placed in service.\n\n\nTotal assets were $5.52 billion at December 31, 2021, up $608.5 million from $4.91 billion at December 31, 2020.\n \n\n\nInvestment securities were $1.38 billion at December 31, 2021, up $484.1 million from December 31, 2020. The increase from year-end 2020 was primarily due to the reinvestment of cash flow from the portfolio, coupled with the deployment of excess liquidity from higher deposit levels into cash flowing agency backed securities.\n \n\n\nTotal loans were $3.68 billion at December 31, 2021, up $84.3 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2020.\n\n\n\u2022\nCommercial mortgage loans totaled $1.41 billion, an increase of $158.9 million, or 13%, from December 31, 2020.\n\n\n\u2022\nCommercial business loans totaled $638.3 million, a decrease of $155.9 million, or 20%, from December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to PPP loans. At December 31, 2021 the aggregate PPP loan balance was $55.3 million, net of deferred fees compared to $248.0 million, net of deferred fees at December 31, 2020.\n\n\n\u2022\nResidential real estate loans totaled $577.3 million, a decrease of $22.5 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2020.\n\n\n\u2022\nConsumer indirect loans totaled $958.0 million, an increase of $117.6 million, or 14%, from December 31, 2020.\n\n\nTotal deposits were $4.83 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase of $548.7 million from December 31, 2020, which was the result of growth in all deposit categories. Short-term borrowings were $30.0 million at December 31, 2021, an increase of $24.7 million from December 31, 2020. Short-term borrowings and brokered deposits have historically been utilized to manage the seasonality of public deposits.\n\n\nShareholders\u2019 equity was $505.1 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $468.4 million at December 31, 2020. Common book value per share was $30.98 at December 31, 2021, an increase of $2.86, or 10%, from $28.12 at December 31, 2020. Tangible common book value per share\n(1)\n was $26.26 at December 31, 2021, an increase of $2.74, or 12%, from $23.52 at December 31, 2020. The increase in shareholders\u2019 equity as compared to December 31, 2020, is primarily attributable to net income less dividends paid, net of the change in accumulated other comprehensive loss.\n\n\nThe Company\u2019s leverage ratio was 8.23% at December 31, 2021 compared to 8.25% at December 31, 2020.

Refer to the \"GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\" section of this Item 7 for further information.\n\n\n(2)\nThe efficiency ratio provides a ratio of operating expenses to operating income. Efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing noninterest expense by net revenue, which is defined as the sum of tax-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income before net gains on investment securities. The efficiency ratio is not a financial measurement required by GAAP. However, the efficiency ratio is used by management in its assessment of financial performance specifically as it relates to noninterest expense control. Management also believes such information is useful to investors in evaluating Company performance.\n\n\nOperational, Accounting and Reporting Impacts Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, including our operating footprint of Western and Central New York. In response to this crisis, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (\u201cCARES\u201d) Act was passed by Congress and signed into law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act provided an estimated $2.2 trillion to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and stimulate the economy by supporting individuals and businesses through loans, grants, tax changes, and other types of relief. Some of the provisions applicable to the Company include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n\u2022\nAccounting for Loan Modifications\n - The CARES Act provides that a financial institution may elect to suspend (1) the application of GAAP for certain loan modifications related to COVID-19 that would otherwise be categorized as a troubled debt restructuring (\u201cTDR\u201d) and (2) any determination that such loan modifications would be considered a TDR, including the related impairment for accounting purposes.\n\n\n\u2022\nPaycheck Protection Program\n - The CARES Act established the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d), an expansion of the Small Business Administration\u2019s (\u201cSBA\u201d) 7(a) loan program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program (\u201cEIDL\u201d), administered directly by the SBA. On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 provided approximately $284 billion for PPP loans in an additional round of funding under the program and extended the PPP through March 31, 2021. This additional round of PPP loan funding was authorized for first-time borrowers and for second draws by certain borrowers who have previously received PPP loans. On March 30, 2021, the PPP Extension Act of 2021 was signed into law, which extended the program to May 31, 2021.\n\n\n\u2022\nMortgage Forbearance\n - Under the CARES Act, a borrower with a federally backed mortgage loan that was experiencing financial hardship due to COVID-19 was able to request a forbearance until December 31, 2021.\n\n\n-\n \n38\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAlso, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (\u201cFRB\u201d), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d), the National Credit Union Administration (\u201cNCUA\u201d), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d), and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d), in consultation with the state financial regulators (collectively, the \u201cagencies\u201d) issued a joint interagency statement (issued March 22, 2020; revised statement issued April 7, 2020). Some of the provisions applicable to the Company include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n\u2022\nAccounting for Loan Modifications \n- Loan modifications that do not meet the conditions of the CARES Act may still qualify as a modification that does not need to be accounted for as a TDR. The agencies confirmed with FASB staff that short-term modifications made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who were current prior to any relief are not TDRs. This includes short-term (e.g., six months) modifications such as payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or insignificant delays in payment.\n\n\n\u2022\nPast Due Reporting \n- With regard to loans not otherwise reportable as past due, financial institutions are not expected to designate loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 as past due because of the deferral. A loan\u2019s payment date is governed by the due date stipulated in the legal agreement. If a financial institution agrees to a payment deferral, these loans would not be considered past due during the period of the deferral.\n\n\n\u2022\nNonaccrual Status and Charge-offs \n- During short-term COVID-19 modifications, these loans generally should not be reported as nonaccrual or as classified\n.\n\n\nEffective March 23, 2020 through July 9, 2020, for consumer customers, the Bank waived early CD penalty fees for withdrawals up to $20,000 (limited to one penalty-free withdrawal per CD account); eliminated all insufficient funds (overdrafts) and returned item fees; eliminated all Pay by Phone fees; waived all late fees; offered the opportunity for monthly mortgage, home equity loan or home equity line payment relief; offered the opportunity to defer unsecured consumer loans or lines of credit and secured consumer loans and lines of credit payments; and offered unsecured personal loans up to $5,000, up to 60 months at 2.95% APR subject to credit approval (additional terms and conditions may apply). In addition, ATM access fees were reinitiated on September 19, 2020.\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have helped more than 2,900 customers obtain more than $370 million in loans through the PPP.  We have helped customers complete the forgiveness process for approximately $320 million of these PPP loans through December 31, 2021.\n \n\n\nThe Company had $532.4 million of loans with modifications related to COVID-19 during 2020, with $46.2 million and $113.0 million still on deferral as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  As of December 31, 2021, we have provided payment deferrals for approximately 6,600 borrowers, the majority being consumer indirect loan customers.  Less than 1% of our loan customers have active payment deferrals as of December 31, 2021 as the  majority of customers whose loans were subject to COVID-19 related deferrals have returned to making regular payments.\n\n\n-\n \n39\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nGAAP to Non-GAAP

We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to our investors as measures of the strength of our capital and ability to generate earnings on tangible common equity invested by our shareholders. These non-GAAP measures provide supplemental information that may help investors to analyze our capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets. Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations and are not uniformly utilized by issuers.

Net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and interest expense on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings used to fund interest-earning and other assets or activities. Net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and by the amount and composition of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the sensitivity of the balance sheet to changes in interest rates, including characteristics such as the fixed or variable nature of the financial instruments, contractual maturities and repricing frequencies.\n\n\nWe use interest rate spread and net interest margin to measure and explain changes in net interest income. Interest rate spread is the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid for interest-bearing liabilities that fund those assets. The net interest margin is expressed as the percentage of net interest income to average earning assets. The net interest margin exceeds the interest rate spread because noninterest-bearing sources of funds (\u201cnet free funds\u201d), principally noninterest-bearing demand deposits and shareholders\u2019 equity, also support earning assets. To compare tax-exempt asset yields to taxable yields, the yield on tax-exempt investment securities is computed on a taxable equivalent basis. Net interest income, interest rate spread, and net interest margin are discussed on a taxable equivalent basis.\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve influences the general market rates of interest, which impacts the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions. The intended federal funds rate, which is the cost of immediately available overnight funds, remained at a range of 0.00% to 0.25% at year-end 2021. The Federal Reserve had previously decreased the intended federal funds rate by 150 basis points due to two rate cuts in March of 2020. On March 3, 2020 it decreased 50 basis points and on March 16, 2020 another 100 basis points, resulting in a range of 0.00% to 0.25% at year-end 2020. The Federal Reserve had previously decreased the intended federal funds rate by 25 basis points in each of August, September and October 2019, resulting in a range of 1.50% to 1.75% at year-end 2019. Our loan portfolio is significantly affected by changes in the prime interest rate and changes in the prime interest rate generally follow changes in the federal funds rate. The prime interest rate, which is the rate offered on loans to borrowers with strong credit, remained at 3.25% at year-end 2021. The prime interest rate had previously decreased to 3.25% in March 2020, reflecting the rate cuts of 50 and 100 basis points after the previous three 25 basis point decreases to 4.75% in 2019.\n\n\nThe following table reconciles interest income per the consolidated statements of income to interest income adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent basis for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2019\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest income per consolidated statements of income\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n167,205\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n161,299\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n168,800\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjustment to fully taxable equivalent basis\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n626\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n871\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,103\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest income adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent basis\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n167,831\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n162,170\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n169,903\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest expense per consolidated statements of income\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n12,475\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n22,314\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n38,888\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet interest income on a taxable equivalent basis\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n155,356\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n139,856\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n131,015\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAnalysis of Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\n\n\nNet interest income on a taxable equivalent basis for 2021 was $155.4 million, an increase of $15.5 million compared to $139.9 million for 2020. The increase in net interest income was due primarily to increases in average loans of $212.7 million, or 6%, and average investment securities of $334.1 million, or 42% compared to 2020 and a decrease in the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, the increase in net interest income from 2020 included an increase in deferred fee amortization on PPP loans of $5.1 million, due to accelerated amortization of fees on PPP loans paid-off, primarily through the forgiveness process.\n\n\nOur net interest margin for 2021 was 3.14%, eight-basis points lower than 3.22% from the prior year. This decrease was a function of a nine-basis point lower contribution from net free funds and a one-basis point increase in the interest rate spread. The change in interest rate spread was a net result of a 34-basis point decrease in the yield on average interest-earning assets and a 35-basis point decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.\n\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the yield on average interest-earning assets of 3.39% was 34-basis points lower than 2020. Loan yields decreased 13-basis points during 2021 to 4.05%. The yield on investment securities decreased 56-basis points during 2021 to 1.75%. Overall, the interest-earning asset rate changes decreased interest income by $9.4 million during 2021 while a favorable volume variance increased interest income by $15.0 million, which collectively drove a $5.7 million increase in interest income.\n\n\n-\n \n41\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAverage interest-earning assets were $4.95 billion for 2021 compared to $4.35 billion for 2020, an increase of $603.5 million, or 14%, with average loans up $212.7 million from $3.44 billion to $3.65 billion and average securities up $334.1 million from $794.9 million to $1.13 billion. The growth in average loans reflected increases in the commercial loans, residential real estate loans and consumer indirect loans categories. Commercial loans, in particular, were up $162.2 million from $1.90 billion to $2.06 billion, or 9%, from 2020. Average balances of PPP loans net of deferred fees, which are included in commercial loans, were $175.4 million and $176.0 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively. Residential real estate loans were up $5.8 million, or 1%, and residential real estate lines were down $15.1 million, or 16%. Consumer indirect loans increased $60.6 million, or 7%, and other consumer loans decreased by $702 thousand, or 4%. Loans comprised 73.8% of average interest-earning assets during 2021 compared to 79.1% during 2020. Loans generally have significantly higher yields compared to securities and federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits and, as such, can have a more positive effect on the net interest margin. The yield on average loans was 4.05% for 2021, a decrease of 13 basis points compared to 4.18% for 2020. An increase in the volume of average loans resulted in a $9.0 million increase in interest income, partially offset by a $4.6 million decrease due to the unfavorable rate variance. Securities comprised 22.8% of average interest-earning assets in 2021 compared to 18.3% in 2020. The taxable equivalent yield on average securities was 1.75% in 2021 compared to 2.31% in 2020. An increase in the volume of average securities resulted in a $5.9 million increase in interest income, partially offset by a $4.5 million decrease due to the unfavorable rate variance.  Our asset mix negatively impacted net interest margin because loans constituted a smaller percentage and investment securities constituted a larger percentage of our interest-earning assets in 2021.\n\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities of 0.34% was 35 basis points lower than 2020 and the cost of average interest-bearing deposits of 0.23% was 34 basis points lower than 2020. Average short-term borrowings decreased $86.0 million from $86.5 million to $538 thousand in 2021. The decrease in average short-term borrowings was a result of our use of brokered deposits as a cost effective alternative to Federal Home Loan Bank (\"FHLB\") borrowings. The cost of long-term borrowings decreased 34 basis points to 5.75%. Overall, interest-bearing liability rate and volume decreases resulted in $9.8 million of lower interest expense during 2021.\n\n\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities of $3.67 billion in 2021 were $422.7 million, or 13%, higher than 2020. On average, interest-bearing deposits grew $482.3 million and noninterest-bearing demand deposits (a principal component of net free funds) were up $199.8 million. The increase in average deposits was due to growth in all deposit categories including non-public deposits, public deposits, reciprocal deposits and brokered deposits, which were utilized as a cost-effective alternative to FHLB borrowings during 2021. For further discussion of our reciprocal and brokered deposits, refer to the \u201cFunding Activities \u2013 Deposits\u201d section of this Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis. Overall, interest-bearing deposit rate and volume changes resulted in $9.7 million of lower interest expense during 2021. Average short-term and long-term borrowings were $74.3 million in 2021, $59.6 million lower than in 2020. Overall, short- and long-term borrowing rate and volume changes resulted in $135 thousand of lower interest expense during 2021.\n\n\n-\n \n42\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe following tables present, for the periods indicated, information regarding: (i) the average balances; (ii) the amount of interest income from interest-earning assets and the resulting annualized yields (tax-exempt yields have been adjusted to a tax-equivalent basis using the applicable Federal tax rate in each year); (iii) the amount of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resulting annualized rates; (iv) net interest income; (v) net interest rate spread; (vi) net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets (\u201cnet interest margin\u201d); and (vii) the ratio of average interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities.

for Credit Losses\n\n\nThe provision for credit losses was a benefit of $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared with a provision of $27.2 million for 2020. There was a benefit for credit losses in each quarter of 2021 as a result of continued improvement in the national unemployment forecast, the designated loss driver for our current expected credit loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) model, positive trends in qualitative factors, a reduction in specific reserves and lower net charge-offs resulting in releases of credit loss reserves. The elevated level of provision for credit losses for 2020 was driven by the adoption of the CECL standard and the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the economic environment. The designated loss driver for our CECL model is the national unemployment forecast, which spiked in early 2020 at the onset of the pandemic and improved in 2021. The provision for credit losses - loans varies based primarily on forecasted unemployment rates, loan growth, net charge-offs, collateral values associated with collateral dependent loans and qualitative factors.\n \n\n\nSee the \u201cAllowance for Credit Losses\u201d and \u201cNon-Performing Assets and Potential Problem Loans\u201d sections of this Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.\n\n\n-\n \n44\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNoninterest Income\n\n\nThe following table summarizes our noninterest income for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2019\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService charges on deposits\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n5,571\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,810\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n7,241\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsurance income\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5,750\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4,403\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4,570\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCard interchange income\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n8,498\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n7,281\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n6,779\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestment advisory\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n11,672\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n9,535\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n9,187\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany owned life insurance\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2,947\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,902\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,758\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestments in limited partnerships\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2,081\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n104\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n352\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoan servicing\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n415\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n249\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n432\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome from derivative instruments, net\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2,695\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5,521\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2,274\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet gain on sale of loans held for sale\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2,950\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3,858\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,352\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet gain on investment securities\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n71\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,599\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,677\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet gain (loss) on other assets\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n441\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(61\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n29\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet loss on tax credit investments\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(431\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(275\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(528\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4,246\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n4,250\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5,258\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal noninterest income\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n46,906\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n43,176\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n40,381\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nService charges on deposits increased $761 thousand, or 16%, to $5.6 million in 2021, compared to $4.8 million in 2020. The increase  in 2021 was primarily due to our COVID-19 relief initiatives implemented from March 23, 2020 to July 9, 2020.\n\n\nInsurance income increased $1.3 million, or 31%, to $5.8 million in 2021, compared to $4.4 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to two 2021 bolt-on acquisitions and growth in the legacy SDN business, including the impact of increasing insurance premiums.\n\n\nCard interchange income increased $1.2 million, or 17%, to $8.5 million in 2021, compared to $7.3 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in customer transactions.\n\n\nInvestment advisory income increased $2.1 million, or 22%, to $11.7 million in 2021, compared to $9.5 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in assets under management driven by a combination of market gains, new customer accounts and contributions to existing accounts.\n\n\nCompany owned life insurance income increased $1.0 million, or 55%, to $2.9 million in 2021, compared to $1.9 million in 2020. We made additional investments in company-owned life insurance of $20.0 million in the third quarter of 2021 and $30.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\n\nIncome from investments in limited partnerships increased $2.0 million to $2.1 million in 2021, compared to $104 thousand in 2020. We have investments in limited partnerships, primarily small business investment companies, and account for these investments under the equity method. The income from these investments fluctuates based on the maturity and performance of the underlying investments.\n\n\nIncome from derivative instruments, net decreased $2.8 million to $2.7 million in 2021, compared to $5.5 million in 2020. Fee income per transaction in 2021 was higher than in 2020, however, aggregate swap fee income decreased $2.2 million as a result of fewer swap transactions. Mortgage derivative income was $589 thousand lower than 2020, primarily as a result of fewer mortgage loans in the pipeline.\n\n\nNet gain on sale of loans held for sale decreased $908 thousand to $3.0 million in 2021, compared to $3.9 million in 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by lower transaction volumes and margins in 2021. Transaction volume and margin were at historically high levels in the second half of 2020, driven by mortgage refinancing activity.\n\n\nNet gain on investment securities decreased $1.5 million to $71 thousand in 2021, compared to $1.6 million in 2020. The amount and timing of our sale of investment securities is dependent on several factors, including our prudent efforts to realize gains while managing duration, premium and credit risk.\n \n\n\n-\n \n45\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNoninterest Expense\n\n\nThe following table summarizes our noninterest expense for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2019\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSalaries and employee benefits\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n60,893\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n59,336\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n56,330\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOccupancy and equipment\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n14,371\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n13,655\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n13,552\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessional services\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n6,535\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n6,326\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5,424\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputer and data processing\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n14,112\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n11,645\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n9,983\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplies and postage\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,769\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,975\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2,036\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFDIC assessments\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2,624\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2,242\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,005\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertising and promotions\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,704\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2,609\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n3,577\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmortization of intangibles\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,060\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,134\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,250\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestructuring charges\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n111\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,492\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n-\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n9,571\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n8,840\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n9,671\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal noninterest expense\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n112,750\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n109,254\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n102,828\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSalaries and employee benefits expense increased $1.6 million, or 3%, to $60.9 million in 2021, compared to $59.3 million in 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to higher performance-based incentive compensation and commissions, investments in personnel and the impact of 2021 acquisitions.\n\n\nOccupancy and equipment expense increased $716 thousand, or 5%, to $14.4 million in 2021 compared to $13.7 million in 2020.  The increase was primarily due to the purchase of personal computers and security equipment for multiple locations and expenses related to two bank branches opened in June 2021.\n\n\nComputer and data processing expense increased $2.5 million, or 21%, to $14.1 million in 2021, compared to $11.6 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to investments in technology, including digital banking initiatives and a customer relationship management solution that was deployed across all lines of business late in 2021.\n\n\nAdvertising and promotions expense decreased $905 thousand, or 35%, to $1.7 million in 2021, compared to $2.6 million in 2020. The decrease was primarily related to a temporary reduction in external advertising expense.  The Company decreased its total advertising spend in both 2021 and 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and is continuing to evaluate its long-term marketing strategy.\n\n\nRestructuring charges were $1.5 million in 2020, representing non-recurring real estate related charges related to the 2020 closure of six branches and a staffing reduction. Additional related restructuring charges of $111 thousand were incurred in 2021 as a result of property valuation adjustments.\n\n\nThe efficiency ratio for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 55.76% compared with 60.22% for 2020. The lower efficiency ratio is a result of higher net interest income associated with an increase in average interest-earning assets for the year, deferred fee amortization on PPP loans, an increase in noninterest income and a decrease in interest expense compared to the prior year. The efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing total noninterest expense by net revenue, defined as the sum of tax-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income before net gains on investment securities. An increase in the efficiency ratio indicates that more resources are being utilized to generate the same volume of income, while a decrease indicates a more efficient allocation of resources. The efficiency ratio, a banking industry financial measure, is not required by GAAP. However, the efficiency ratio is used by management in its assessment of financial performance specifically as it relates to noninterest expense control. Management also believes such information is useful to investors in evaluating Company performance.\n\n\nIncome Taxes\n\n\nWe recorded income tax expense of $19.5 million for 2021, compared to $7.4 million for 2020. In 2021 and 2020, we recognized tax credit investments resulting in a $2.6 million and $1.5 million reduction in income tax expense, respectively, and a $431 thousand and $275 thousand net loss recorded in noninterest income, respectively.\n \n\n\nOur effective tax rate was 20.1% for 2021 compared to 16.2% for 2020. Effective tax rates are typically impacted by items of income and expense that are not subject to federal or state taxation. Our effective tax rates reflect the impact of these items, which include, but are not limited to, interest income from tax-exempt securities, earnings on company owned life insurance and the impact of tax credit investments. In addition, our effective tax rate for 2021 and 2020 reflects the New York State tax benefit generated by our real estate investment trust.\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n-\n \n46\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED\n\n\nDECEMBER 31, 2020 AND DECEMBER 31, 2019\n\n\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019, which are not included in this Form 10-K, can be found under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the \nCompany\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020\n and are incorporated by reference herein.\n\n\nANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we had total assets of $5.52 billion, an increase of 12% from $4.91 billion as of December 31, 2020, largely attributable to organic loan growth and an increase in our investment securities portfolio. Net loans were $3.64 billion as of December 31, 2021, up $97.0 million, or 3%, when compared to $3.54 billion as of December 31, 2020. The increase in net loans was primarily attributable to organic growth in our consumer indirect loans. Non-performing assets totaled $12.2 million as of December 31, 2021, down $317 thousand from a year ago. Total deposits amounted to $4.83 billion as of December 31, 2021, up $548.7 million, or 13%, compared to December 31, 2020.

This policy dictates that investment decisions will be made based on the safety of the investment, liquidity requirements, potential returns, cash flow targets, need for collateral and desired risk parameters. In pursuing these objectives, we consider the ability of an investment to provide earnings consistent with factors of quality, maturity, marketability, pledgeable nature and risk diversification. Our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, guided by ALCO, is responsible for investment portfolio decisions within the established policies.\n\n\nOur available for sale (\u201cAFS\u201d) investment securities portfolio increased $550.5 million from $628.1 million at December 31, 2020 to $1.18 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase from year-end 2020 was primarily due to the reinvestment of cash flow from the portfolio, coupled with the deployment of excess liquidity from higher deposit levels into cash flowing agency backed securities. Our AFS portfolio had a net unrealized loss totaling $6.3 million at December 31, 2021 compared to a net unrealized gain of $20.4 million at December 31, 2020. The fair value of most of the investment securities in the AFS portfolio fluctuates as market interest rates change.\n\n\n-\n \n47\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nImpairment Assessment\n\n\nFor AFS securities in an unrealized loss position, we first assess whether (i) we intend to sell, or (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either case is affirmative, any previously recognized allowances are charged-off and the security's amortized cost is written down to fair value through income. If neither case is affirmative, the security is evaluated to determine whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency and any adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. Adjustments to the allowance are reported in our income statement as a component of credit loss expense. AFS securities are charged-off against the allowance or, in the absence of any allowance, written down through income when deemed uncollectible by management or when either of the aforementioned criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. For the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 no allowance for credit losses has been recognized on AFS securities in an unrealized loss position as management does not believe any of the securities are impaired due to reasons of credit quality.\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we do not have the intent to sell any of our securities in a loss position and we believe that it is not likely that we will be required to sell any such securities before the anticipated recovery of amortized cost. The unrealized losses are largely due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased. The fair value is expected to recover as the bonds approach their maturity date, repricing date or if market yields for such investments decline. We do not believe any of the securities in a loss position are impaired due to reasons of credit quality. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2021, we concluded that unrealized losses on our AFS securities are not impaired due to reasons of credit quality and no allowance for credit losses has been recognized on AFS securities. The following discussion provides further details of our assessment of the AFS securities portfolio by investment category.\n\n\nU.S. Government Agencies and Government Sponsored Enterprises (\u201cGSE\u201d).\n As of December 31, 2021, there was one security in an unrealized loss position for less than 12 months in the U.S. Government agencies and GSE portfolio with an unrealized loss totaling $97 thousand. The decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates, not to credit quality.  We did not have the intent to sell this security and it was likely that we will not be required to sell the security before the anticipated recovery.\n\n\nAgency Mortgage-backed Securities.\n With the exception of the non-Agency mortgage-backed securities (\u201cnon-Agency MBS\u201d) discussed below, all of the mortgage-backed securities held by us as of December 31, 2021, were issued by U.S. Government sponsored entities and agencies (\u201cAgency MBS\u201d), primarily FNMA and FHLMC. The contractual cash flows of our Agency MBS are guaranteed by FNMA, FHLMC or GNMA. The GNMA mortgage-backed securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government.\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, there were 116 securities in the AFS Agency MBS portfolio that were in an unrealized loss position with unrealized losses totaling $14.7 million. Of these, 28 were in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer and had an aggregate fair value of $172.2 million and unrealized losses of $4.7 million dollars.  The unrealized loss of these securities is driven by the timing of the purchases of fixed-rate securities during the extended low interest rate environments experienced over the past two years, which has been compounded with subsequent increases in benchmark interest rates. However, these fixed-rate securities were purchased with the expectation that they will continue to prepay principal and the proceeds will be invested at current market rates.\n\n\nGiven the high credit quality inherent in Agency MBS, we do not consider any of the unrealized losses as of December 31, 2021 on such Agency MBS to be credit related. As of December 31, 2021, we did not intend to sell any Agency MBS that were in an unrealized loss position, all of which were performing in accordance with their terms.\n\n\nNon-Agency Mortgage-backed Securities.\n Our non-Agency MBS portfolio consists of positions in one privately issued whole loan collateralized mortgage obligations with a fair value and net unrealized gain of $410 thousand as of December 31, 2021. As of that date, the one non-Agency MBS was rated below investment grade. This security was not in an unrealized loss position.\n\n\nOther Investments.\n As a member of the FHLB, the Bank is required to hold FHLB stock. The amount of required FHLB stock is based on the Bank\u2019s asset size and the amount of borrowings from the FHLB. We have assessed the ultimate recoverability of our FHLB stock and believe that no impairment currently exists. As a member of the FRB system, we are required to maintain a specified investment in FRB stock based on a ratio relative to our capital. At December 31, 2021, our ownership of FHLB and FRB stock totaled $4.4 million and $6.4 million, respectively, and is included in other assets and recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.\n\n\n-\n \n48\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLENDING ACTIVITIES\n\n\nTotal loans were $3.68 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase of $84.3 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2020.

The decrease was driven by the forgiveness or repayment of PPP loans. PPP loans net of deferred fees are included in commercial business loans and were $55.3 million at December 31, 2021 and $248.0 million at December 31, 2020. Accordingly, commercial business loans excluding the impact of PPP loans increased 7% from December 31, 2020. Commercial mortgage loans increased $158.9 million, or 13%, from December 31, 2020 to $1.41 billion at December 31, 2021. The credit risk related to commercial loans is largely influenced by general economic conditions, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on small to mid-sized business in our market area, inflation, and the resulting impact on a borrower\u2019s operations or on the value of underlying collateral, if any.\n\n\nFactors that are important to managing overall credit quality are sound loan underwriting and administration, systematic monitoring of existing loans and commitments, effective loan review on an ongoing basis, early identification of potential problems, an appropriate allowance for credit losses, and sound nonaccrual and charge off policies.\n\n\nAn active credit risk management process is used for commercial loans to further ensure that sound and consistent credit decisions are made. Credit risk is controlled by detailed underwriting procedures, comprehensive loan administration, and periodic review of borrowers\u2019 outstanding loans and commitments. Borrower relationships are formally reviewed and graded on an ongoing basis for early identification of potential problems. Further analyses by customer, industry, and geographic location are performed to monitor trends, financial performance, and concentrations.\n\n\nWe participate in various lending programs in which guarantees are supplied by U.S. government agencies, such as the SBA, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Rural Economic and Community Development and Farm Service Agency, among others. As of December 31, 2021, the principal balance of such loans (included in commercial loans) was $87.6 million and the guaranteed portion amounted to $72.7 million. Excluding PPP Loans, the principal balance of such loans (included in commercial loans) was $30.1 million and the guaranteed portion amounted to $15.2 million. Most of these loans were guaranteed by the SBA.\n\n\nCommercial business loans were $638.3 million at the end of 2021, down $155.9 million, or 20%, since the end of 2020, and comprised 17.3% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2021, compared to 22.1% at December 31, 2020. The decrease in commercial business loans was primarily driven by the forgiveness or repayment of PPP loans. As of December 31, 2021, we had $55.3 million of PPP loans, net of deferred loan fees and costs compared to $248.0 million at December 31, 2020. We typically originate business loans of up to $15.0 million for small to mid-sized businesses in our market area for working capital, equipment financing, inventory financing, accounts receivable financing, or other general business purposes. Loans of this type are in a diverse range of industries. As of December 31, 2021, commercial business SBA loans including PPP loans accounted for a total of $75.1 million, or 12% of our commercial business loan portfolio.\n \n\n\n-\n \n49\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCommercial mortgage loans totaled $1.41 billion at December 31, 2021, up $158.9 million, or 13%, from December 31, 2020, and comprised 38.4% of total loans, compared to 34.9% at December 31, 2020. Commercial mortgage loans include both owner occupied and non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans. Approximately 23% and 24% of our commercial mortgage portfolio at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, was owner occupied commercial real estate. The majority of our commercial real estate loans are secured by office buildings, manufacturing facilities, distribution/warehouse facilities, and retail centers, which are generally located in our local market area. As of December 31, 2021, commercial mortgage SBA loans accounted for a total of $5.4 million or less than one percent of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio.\n\n\nWe determine our current lending standards for commercial real estate and real estate construction lending by property type and specifically address many criteria, including: maximum loan amounts, maximum loan-to-value (\u201cLTV\u201d), requirements for pre-leasing or pre-sales, minimum debt-service coverage ratios, minimum borrower equity, and maximum loan to cost. Currently, the maximum standard for LTV is 85%, with lower limits established for certain higher risk types, such as raw land which has a 65% LTV maximum.\n\n\nConsumer loans totaled $1.63 billion at December 31, 2021, up $81.3 million compared to 2020, and represented 44.3% of the 2021 year-end loan portfolio versus 43.0% at year-end 2020. Loans in this classification include residential real estate loans, residential real estate lines, indirect consumer and other consumer installment loans. Credit risk for these types of loans is generally influenced by general economic conditions, including inflation, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the employment income of these borrowers, the characteristics of individual borrowers, and the nature of the loan collateral. Risks of loss are generally on smaller average balances per loan spread over many borrowers. Once charged off, there is usually less opportunity for recovery on these smaller retail loans. Credit risk is primarily controlled by reviewing the creditworthiness of the borrowers, monitoring payment histories, and taking appropriate collateral and guaranty positions.\n\n\nResidential real estate portfolios include conventional first lien mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit. For conventional first lien mortgages, we generally limit the maximum loan to 85% of collateral value without credit enhancement (e.g. personal mortgage insurance). A portion of our fixed-rate conventional mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market with servicing rights retained. Our conventional mortgage products continue to be underwritten using FHLMC secondary marketing guidelines. Our underwriting guidelines for home equity products include a combination of borrower FICO (credit score), the LTV of the property securing the loan and evidence of the borrower having sufficient income to repay the loan. Currently, for home equity products, the maximum acceptable LTV is 90%. The average FICO score for new home equity production was 768 and 764 during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n\nResidential real estate loans totaled $577.3 million at the end of 2021, down $22.5 million, or 4%, from the end of the prior year and comprised 15.7% and 16.7% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The residential real estate line portfolio amounted to $78.5 million at December 31, 2021 down $11.3 million, or 13%, compared to 2020 and represented 2.2% of the 2021 year-end loan portfolio versus 2.5% at year-end 2020. The residential real estate loans and lines portfolios had a weighted average LTV at origination of approximately 70% and 69% at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Approximately 93% and 92% of the loans and lines were first lien positions at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n\nConsumer indirect loans amounted to $958.0 million at December 31, 2021 up $117.6 million, or 14%, compared to 2020 and represented 26.0% of the 2021 year-end loan portfolio versus 23.4% at year-end 2020. The loans are primarily for the purchase of automobiles (both new and used) and light duty trucks primarily by individuals, but also by corporations and other organizations. The loans are originated through dealerships and assigned to us with terms that typically range from 36 to 84 months. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we originated $504.3 million in indirect loans with a mix of approximately 25% new vehicles and 75% used vehicles. This compares with $318.9 million in indirect loans with a mix of approximately 33% new vehicles and 67% used vehicles for the same period in 2020. We do business with over 450 franchised auto dealers located in Western, Central, and the Capital District of New York, and Northern and Central Pennsylvania. The average FICO score for indirect loan production was 706 and 712 during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Other consumer loans totaled $14.5 million at December 31, 2021, down 2.6 million, or 15%, compared to 2020, and represented less than one percent of the 2021 and 2020 year-end loan portfolio. Other consumer loans consist of personal loans (collateralized and uncollateralized) and deposit account collateralized loans.\n\n\nOur loan portfolio is widely diversified by types of borrowers, industry groups, and market areas within our operating footprint. Significant loan concentrations are considered to exist for a financial institution when there are amounts loaned to numerous borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. At December 31, 2021, no significant concentrations, as defined above, existed in our portfolio in excess of 10% of total loans.\n\n\n-\n \n50\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLoans Held for Sale and Loan Servicing Rights.\n Loans held for sale (not included in the loan portfolio composition table) were entirely comprised of residential real estate loans and totaled $6.2 million and $4.3 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n\nWe sell certain qualifying newly originated or refinanced residential real estate loans on the secondary market.

The decrease in commercial business net charge-offs in 2021 was primarily due to an $8.2 million partial charge-off of an $11.9 million commercial loan downgraded in the first quarter of 2020 and for which a foreclosure occurred in the third quarter of 2020. The borrower\u2019s business was related to the hospitality industry and the downgrade and charge-off were precipitated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in commercial mortgage net charge-offs in 2021 was primarily due to a $3.8 million partial charge off of an $7.8 million commercial loan downgraded in the fourth quarter of 2021. The allowance for credit losses - loans was $39.7 million at December 31, 2021, compared with $52.4 million at December 31, 2020.

Adjustments to the quantitative evaluation may be made for differences in current or expected qualitative risk characteristics such as changes in: underwriting standards, delinquency level, regulatory environment, economic condition, Company management and the status of portfolio administration including the Company\u2019s credit risk review function. The Company establishes a specific reserve for individually evaluated loans which do not share similar risk characteristics with the loans included in the forecasted allowance for credit losses. These individually evaluated loans are removed from the pooling approach discussed above for the forecasted allowance for credit losses, and include nonaccrual loans, TDRs, and other loans deemed appropriate by management.\n \nThe process we use to determine the overall allowance for credit losses is based on this analysis. Based on this analysis, we believe the allowance for credit losses is adequate as of December 31, 2021.\n \n\n\nAssessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses involves substantial uncertainties and is based upon management\u2019s evaluation of the amounts required to meet estimated charge-offs in the loan portfolio after weighing a variety of factors, including the risk profile of our loan products and customers.\n\n\nFactors beyond our control, however, such as general national and local economic conditions, can adversely impact the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. As a result, no assurance can be given that adverse economic conditions or other circumstances will not result in increased losses in the portfolio or that the allowance for credit losses will be sufficient to meet actual loan losses. See Part I, Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for the risks impacting this estimate. Management presents a quarterly review of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors based on the methodology that is described in further detail in Part I, Item I \u201cBusiness\u201d under the section titled \u201cLending Activities.\u201d See also \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates\u201d for additional information on the allowance for credit losses.\n\n\nThe adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is subject to ongoing management review. While management evaluates currently available information in establishing the allowance for credit losses - loans, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluations. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for credit losses - loans. Such agencies may require us to increase the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.\n\n\n-\n \n52\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNon-performing Assets and Potential Problem Loans\n\n\nThe following table summarizes our non-performing assets (in thousands):\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNon-performing Assets\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAt December 31,\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonaccrual loans:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommercial business\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n602\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,975\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommercial mortgage\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n6,414\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2,906\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidential real estate loans\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2,373\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2,587\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidential real estate lines\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n200\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n323\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsumer indirect\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,780\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,495\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther consumer\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n-\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n-\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal nonaccrual loans\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n11,369\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n9,286\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccruing loans 90 days or more delinquent\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n797\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n231\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal non-performing loans\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n12,166\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n9,517\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeclosed assets\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n-\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2,966\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal non-performing assets\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n12,166\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n12,483\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonaccrual loans to total loans\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.31\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.26\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-performing loans to total loans\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.33\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.26\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-performing assets to total assets\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.22\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.25\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nNon-performing assets include non-performing loans and foreclosed assets. Non-performing assets at December 31, 2021 were $12.2 million, a decrease of $317 thousand from $12.5 million at December 31, 2020. The primary component of non-performing assets is non-performing loans, which were $12.2 million or 0.33% of total loans at December 31, 2021, compared with $9.5 million or 0.26% of total loans at December 31, 2020. The increase in nonperforming loans was primarily due to the downgrade of a $7.8 million commercial mortgage loan, with $3.8 million partially charged-off, in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n \n\n\nApproximately $7.8 million, or 69%, of the $11.4 million of nonaccrual loans, a component of non-performing loans, as of December 31, 2021 were current with respect to payment of principal and interest but were classified as non-accruing because repayment in full of principal and/or interest was uncertain. We had no TDRs included in nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2021 and $200 thousand at December 31, 2020. Additionally, we had no TDRs that were accruing interest as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\n\n\nForeclosed assets consist of real property formerly pledged as collateral for loans, which we have acquired through foreclosure proceedings or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. We had no properties representing foreclosed asset holdings at December 31, 2021 and two properties totaling $3.0 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease in foreclosed assets during 2021 was primarily the result of the sale of an asset on which foreclosure occurred in the third quarter of 2020. The borrower's business was related to the hospitality industry and the downgrade and partial charge-off in the first quarter of 2020 were precipitated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nPotential problem loans are loans that are currently performing, but information known about possible credit problems of the borrowers causes us to have concern as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan payment terms and may result in disclosure of such loans as nonperforming at some time in the future. These loans remain in a performing status due to a variety of factors, including payment history, the value of collateral supporting the credits, and/or personal or government guarantees. We consider loans classified as substandard, which continue to accrue interest, to be potential problem loans. We identified $22.7 million and $17.9 million in loans that continued to accrue interest which were classified as substandard as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n\n-\n \n53\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFUNDING ACTIVITIES\n\n\nDeposits\n\n\nThe following table summarizes the composition of our deposits (dollars in thousands).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAt December 31,\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAmount\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPercent\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAmount\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPercent\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoninterest-bearing demand\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,107,561\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n22.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,018,549\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n23.8\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest-bearing demand\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n864,528\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n17.9\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n731,885\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n17.1\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSavings and money market\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,933,047\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n40.0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1,642,340\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n38.4\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime deposits\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n921,954\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n19.1\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n885,593\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n20.7\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal deposits\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,827,090\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n100.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n4,278,367\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n100.0\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the aggregate amount of uninsured deposits (deposits in amounts greater than $250,000, which is the maximum amount for federal deposit insurance) was $1.29 billion and $1.08 billion, respectively. The portion of our time deposits by account that were in excess of the FDIC insurance limit was $182.3 million and $155.3 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The maturities of our uninsured time deposits at December 31, 2021 were as follows: $45.2 million in three months or less; $74.7 million between three months and six months; $62.1 million between six months and one year; and $287 thousand over one year.\n \n\n\nWe offer a variety of deposit products designed to attract and retain customers, with the primary focus on building and expanding long-term relationships. At December 31, 2021, total deposits were $4.83 billion, representing an increase of $548.7 million, or 13%, for the year. The increase from December 31, 2020, was primarily due to growth in non-public, public and reciprocal deposits. Time deposits were approximately 19% and 21% of total deposits at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n\nNonpublic deposits, the largest component of our funding sources, totaled $2.70 billion and $2.55 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and represented 56% and 60% of total deposits as of the end of each period, respectively. We have managed this segment of funding through a strategy of competitive pricing that minimizes the number of customer relationships that have only a single service high cost deposit account.\n\n\nAs an additional source of funding, we offer a variety of public (municipal) deposit products to the towns, villages, counties and school districts within our market. Public deposits generally range from 20% to 30% of our total deposits. There is a high degree of seasonality in this component of funding, because the level of deposits varies with the seasonal cash flows for these public customers. We maintain the necessary levels of short-term liquid assets to accommodate the seasonality associated with public deposits. Total public deposits were $1.10 billion and $834.9 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, and represented 23% and 20% of total deposits as of the end of each period, respectively.\n\n\nWe participate in reciprocal deposit programs, which enable depositors to receive FDIC insurance coverage for deposits otherwise exceeding the maximum insurable amount. Through these programs, deposits in excess of the maximum insurable amount are placed with multiple participating financial institutions. Reciprocal deposits totaled $771.4 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $612.3 million at December 31, 2020, and represented 16% and 14% of total deposits as of the end of each period, respectively.\n\n\nBrokered deposits totaled $254.7 million and $279.6 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and represented 5% and 7% of total deposits as of the end of each period, respectively.\n\n\nBorrowings\n\n\nThe Company classifies borrowings as short-term or long-term in accordance with the original terms of the agreement.

Short-term FHLB borrowings at December 31, 2021 consisted of $30.0 million in short-term borrowings. Short-term FHLB borrowings at December 31, 2020 consisted of $5.3 million in short-term borrowings. The FHLB borrowings are collateralized by securities from the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and certain qualifying loans. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company\u2019s borrowings had a weighted average rate of 0.34% and 1.70%, respectively.\n\n\nWe have credit capacity with the FHLB and can borrow through facilities that include amortizing and term advances or repurchase agreements. We had approximately $201.7 million of immediate credit capacity with the FHLB as of December 31, 2021. We had approximately $613.4 million in secured borrowing capacity at the FRB discount window, none of which was outstanding at December 31, 2021. The FHLB and FRB credit capacity are collateralized by securities from our investment portfolio and certain qualifying loans. We had approximately $130.0 million of credit available under unsecured federal funds purchased lines with various banks as of December 31, 2021, with no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2021. Additionally, we had approximately $534.6 million of unencumbered liquid securities available for pledging.\n\n\nThe Parent has a revolving line of credit with a commercial bank allowing borrowings up to $20.0 million in total as an additional source of working capital. At December 31, 2021, no amounts have been drawn on the line of credit.\n\n\nLong-term Borrowings\n\n\nOn October 7, 2020, we completed a private placement of $35.0 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2030 to qualified institutional buyers and accredited institutional investors that were subsequently exchanged for subordinated notes with substantially the same terms (the \u201c2020 Notes\u201d) registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The 2020 Notes have a maturity date of October 15, 2030 and bear interest, payable semi-annually, at the rate of 4.375% per annum, until October 15, 2025. Commencing on that date, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to the then current three-month SOFR plus 4.265%, payable quarterly until maturity. The 2020 Notes are redeemable by us, in whole or in part, on any interest payment date on or after October 15, 2025, and we may redeem the Notes in whole at any time upon certain other specified events. We used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, organic growth and to support regulatory capital ratios at Five Star Bank.\n\n\nOn April 15, 2015, we issued $40.0 million of subordinated notes (the \u201c2015 Notes\u201d) in a registered public offering. The 2015 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.0% per year, payable semi-annually, for the first 10 years. From April 15, 2025 to the April 15, 2030 maturity date, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an annual interest rate equal to the then current three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) plus 3.944%, payable quarterly. After the discontinuance of LIBOR, the interest rate will be determined by an alternate method as reasonably selected by the Company. The 2015 Notes are redeemable by us at any quarterly interest payment date beginning on April 15, 2025 to maturity at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Proceeds, net of debt issuance costs of $1.1 million, were $38.9 million. The 2020 and 2015 Notes qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes.\n\n\nShareholders\u2019 Equity\n\n\nTotal shareholders\u2019 equity was $505.1 million at December 31, 2021, an increase of $36.8 million from $468.4 million at December 31, 2020. Net income for the year increased shareholders\u2019 equity by $77.7 million, partially offset by common and preferred stock dividends declared of $18.5 million. Accumulated other comprehensive loss included in shareholders\u2019 equity increased $15.3 million during the year due primarily to higher net unrealized losses on securities available for sale. Treasury stock included in shareholders' equity increased $8.0 million primarily due to the purchase of shares of common stock in 2021 under our 2020 Repurchase Program. For detailed information on shareholders\u2019 equity, see Note 16, Shareholders\u2019 Equity, of the notes to consolidated financial statements. FII and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements. At December 31, 2021, both FII and the Bank exceeded all regulatory requirements. For detailed information on regulatory capital requirements, see Note 15, Regulatory Matters, of the notes to consolidated financial statements.\n\n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\n\nThe objective of maintaining adequate liquidity is to assure that we meet our financial obligations. These obligations include the withdrawal of deposits on demand or at their contractual maturity, the repayment of matured borrowings, the ability to fund new and existing loan commitments and the ability to take advantage of new business opportunities. We achieve liquidity by maintaining a strong base of both core customer funds and maturing short-term assets; we also rely on our ability to sell or pledge securities and lines-of-credit and our overall ability to access to the financial and capital markets.\n\n\nLiquidity for the Bank is managed through the monitoring of anticipated changes in loans, the investment portfolio, core deposits and wholesale funds. The strength of the Bank\u2019s liquidity position is a result of its base of core customer deposits. These core deposits are supplemented by wholesale funding sources that include credit lines with the other banking institutions, the FHLB and the FRB.\n\n\n-\n \n55\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe primary sources of liquidity for FII are dividends from the Bank and access to financial and capital markets. Dividends from the Bank are limited by various regulatory requirements related to capital adequacy and earnings trends. The Bank relies on cash flows from operations, core deposits, borrowings and short-term liquid assets.\n\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $79.1 million as of December 31, 2021, a decrease of approximately $14.8 million from $93.9 million as of December 31, 2020. During 2021, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $59.4 million and the principal source of operating activity cash flow was net income adjusted for noncash income and expense items. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $619.8 million, which included outflows of $502.4 million from net investment securities transactions and outflows of $90.1 million for net loan originations. Net cash provided by financing activities of $545.7 million was attributed to a $548.7 million increase in deposits and a $24.7 million increase in short-term borrowings, partially offset by $9.2 million in purchases of common stock for treasury and $18.5 million in dividend payments.\n\n\nPlanned Uses of Capital Resources\n\n\nThe Company has various long-term contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021, which include:\n\n\n\u2022\nTime deposits for $922.0 million;\n\n\n\u2022\nSupplemental executive retirement plans for $1.0 million;\n\n\n\u2022\nSubordinated notes for $75.0 million; and\n\n\n\u2022\nOperating leases for $37.7 million.\n\n\nFor additional information on the Company's long-term contractual obligations above, see Note 11, Deposits, Note 21, Employee Benefit Plans, Note 12, Borrowings, and Note 9, Leases, in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n \n\n\n-\n \n56\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe have financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk established in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit for $936.3 million and standby letters of credit for $24.9 million as of December 31, 2021. We do not expect all of the commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit to be funded. Thus, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements.\n\n\nWe have committed to investments in limited partnerships primarily related to small business investment companies and tax credit investments. As of December 31, 2021, the off-balance sheet commitments related to the limited partnership small business investment companies and tax credit investments totaled $6.4 million and $9.7 million, respectively.  We have also recorded a $20.2 million liability primarily related to committed contributions for tax credit investments in property placed in service on or before December 31, 2021.  The timing of future contributions to be made to these tax credit investments cannot be specifically or reasonably determined.\n\n\nWith the exception of obligations in connection with our irrevocable loan commitments, limited partnership investments and tax credit investments as of December 31, 2021, we had no other off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. For additional information on off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\n\nSecurity Yields and Maturities Schedule\n\n\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding the amortized cost (\u201cCost\u201d), cost-weighted average yields (\u201cYield\u201d), which is defined as the book yield weighted against the ending book value, and contractual maturities of our debt securities portfolio as of December 31, 2021. Mortgage-backed securities are included in maturity categories based on their stated maturity date. Actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities presented because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay certain investments. No tax-equivalent adjustments were made to the weighted average yields. The tax-exempt portfolio book balance has decreased by $43.3 million since December 31, 2020 due to maturities in 2021 (dollars in thousands).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDue

Resources\n\n\nThe FRB has adopted a system using risk-based capital guidelines to evaluate the capital adequacy of bank holding companies on a consolidated basis. The final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\u2019s (\u201cBCBS\u201d) capital guidelines for U.S. banks were fully phased-in on January 1, 2019. As of December 31, 2021, the Company\u2019s capital levels remained characterized as \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d under the BCBS rules. See Note 15, Regulatory Matters of the notes to consolidated financial statements and the \u201cBasel III Capital Rules\u201d section below for further discussion.

Under the 2020 CECL transition provision, the regulatory capital impact of the Day 1 adjustment to the allowance for credit losses (after-tax) upon the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date has been deferred and will phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022. For the ongoing impact of CECL, we are allowed to defer the regulatory capital impact of the allowance for credit losses in an amount equal to 25% of the change in the allowance for credit losses (pre-tax) recognized through earnings for each period between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021. The cumulative adjustment to the allowance for credit losses between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021, will also phase in to regulatory capital at 25% per year commencing January 1, 2022.\n\n\nBasel III Capital Rules\n\n\nUnder the Basel III Rules, the current minimum capital ratios, including an additional capital conservation buffer applicable to the Company and the Bank, are:\n\n\n\u2022\n7.0% CET1 to risk-weighted assets;\n\n\n\u2022\n8.5% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and\n\n\n\u2022\n10.5% Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets.\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company\u2019s capital levels remained characterized as \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d under the Basel III rules.\n\n\n-\n \n59\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and are consistent with predominant practices in the financial services industry. Application of critical accounting policies, which are those policies that management believes are the most important to our financial position and results, requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. Future changes in information may affect these estimates, assumptions and judgments, which, in turn, may affect amounts reported in the financial statements.\n\n\nWe have numerous accounting policies, of which the most significant are presented in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the notes to consolidated financial statements. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and, in this discussion, provide information on how significant assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are reported in the consolidated financial statements and how those reported amounts are determined. Based on the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying those amounts, management has determined that the accounting policies with respect to the allowance for credit losses, valuation of goodwill and deferred tax assets, and accounting for defined benefit plans require particularly subjective or complex judgments important to our financial position and results of operations, and, as such, are considered to be critical accounting policies as discussed below. These estimates and assumptions are based on management\u2019s best estimates and judgment and are evaluated on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment. We adjust these estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Illiquid credit markets and volatile equity have combined with declines in consumer spending to increase the uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions. As future events cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from our estimates.\n\n\nAdequacy of the Allowance for Credit Losses\n\n\nThe allowance for credit losses represents management\u2019s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of subjective measurements including, but not limited to, management\u2019s assessment of the internal risk classifications of loans, estimating future losses utilizing current forecasts, forward-looking estimates of qualitative factors including existing economic conditions, portfolio administration, delinquency, the regulatory environment and the Company\u2019s lending policies. Because current economic conditions and borrower strength can change, and future events are inherently difficult to predict, the anticipated amount of estimated loan losses, and therefore the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses, could change significantly. As an integral part of their examination process, various regulatory agencies also review the allowance for credit losses. Such agencies may require additions to the allowance for credit losses or may require that certain loan balances be charged off or downgraded into criticized loan categories when their credit evaluations differ from those of management, based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. We believe the level of the allowance for credit losses is appropriate as recorded in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n\nFor additional discussion related to our accounting policies for the allowance for credit losses, see the sections titled \u201cAllowance for Credit Losses\u201d in Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the notes to consolidated financial statements.\n\n\nValuation of Goodwill\n\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in accordance with the purchase method of accounting for business combinations. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is not amortized but is tested for impairment. GAAP requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at our reporting unit level on an annual basis and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. We test goodwill for impairment as of October 1\nst\n of each year.\n\n\nImpairment exists when a reporting unit\u2019s carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value. In testing goodwill for impairment, GAAP permits us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, no further testing is performed. However, if we conclude otherwise, we would then be required to perform a goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value.  If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the difference, but not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\n\n\n-\n \n60\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nValuation of Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\n\n\nThe determination of deferred tax expense or benefit is based on changes in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that generate temporary differences. The carrying value of our net deferred tax assets or liabilities assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income based on estimates and assumptions (after consideration of historical taxable income as well as tax planning strategies). If these estimates and related assumptions change, we may be required to record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting in additional income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of income. We evaluate deferred tax assets and liabilities on a quarterly basis and assess the need for a valuation allowance, if any. A valuation allowance is established when management believes that it is more likely than not that some portion of its deferred tax assets and liabilities will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowance from period to period are included in our tax provision in the period of change. For additional discussion related to our accounting policy for income taxes see Note 19, Income Taxes, of the notes to consolidated financial statements.\n\n\nDefined Benefit Pension Plan\n\n\nWe have a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees. For employees hired prior to December 31, 2006, who met participation requirements on or before January 1, 2008 (\u201cTier 1 Participant\u201d), the benefits are generally based on years of service and the employee\u2019s highest average compensation during five consecutive years of employment. For eligible employees who were hired on and after January 1, 2007 (\u201cTier 2 Participant\u201d), the benefits are generally based on a cash balance benefit formula. Assumptions are made concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of required benefit payments, funding requirements and defined benefit pension expense. The major assumptions are the weighted average discount rate used in determining the current benefit obligation, the weighted average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increase and the estimated mortality rate. The weighted average discount rate was based upon the projected benefit cash flows and the market yields of high grade corporate bonds that are available to pay such cash flows as of the measurement date, December 31. The weighted average expected long-term rate of return is estimated based on current trends experienced by the assets in the plan as well as projected future rates of return on those assets and reasonable actuarial assumptions for long term inflation, and the real and nominal rate of investment return for a specific mix of asset classes. The current target asset allocation model for the plans is detailed in Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements. The expected returns on these various asset categories are blended to derive one long-term return assumption. The assets are invested in certain collective investment and mutual funds, common stocks, U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government agency securities, and corporate and municipal bonds and notes. The rate of compensation increase is based on reviewing the compensation increase practices of other plan sponsors in similar industries and geographic areas as well as the expectation of future increases. Mortality rate assumptions are based on mortality tables published by third-parties such as the Society of Actuaries (\u201cSOA\u201d), considering other available information including historical data as well as studies and publications from reputable sources. We review the pension plan assumptions on an annual basis with our actuarial consultants to determine if the assumptions are reasonable and adjust the assumptions to reflect changes in future expectations.\n\n\nThe assumptions used to calculate 2021 expense for the defined benefit pension plan were a weighted average discount rate of 2.32%, a weighted average long-term rate of return on plan assets of 5.25% and a rate of compensation increase of 3.00%. Defined benefit pension expense in 2022 is expected to decrease to $1.8 million from the $1.9 million recorded in 2021.\n\n\nDue to the long-term nature of pension plan assumptions, actual results may differ significantly from the actuarial-based estimates. Differences resulting in actuarial gains or losses are required to be recorded in shareholders\u2019 equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and amortized to defined benefit pension expense in future years. For 2021, the actual return on plan assets in the qualified defined benefit pension plan was $6.4 million, compared to an expected return on plan assets of $5.2 million. Total pretax losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2021 were $12.6 million for the defined benefit pension plan. Actuarial pretax net gains recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $3.1 million for the defined benefit pension plan.\n\n\nDefined benefit pension expense is recorded in \u201cSalaries and employee benefits\u201d expense on the consolidated statements of income.\n\n\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\n\nSee Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\n\n\n-\n \n61\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "item7a": ">ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITA\nTIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAsset-Liability Management\n\n\nThe principal objective of our interest rate risk management is to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in assets and liabilities, determine the appropriate level of risk to us given our business strategy, operating environment, capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives, and manage the risk consistent with the guidelines approved by our Board of Directors. Management is responsible for reviewing with the Board of Directors our activities and strategies, the effect of those strategies on net interest income, the fair value of the portfolio and the effect that changes in interest rates will have on the portfolio and exposure limits. Management has developed an Asset-Liability Management and Investment Policy that meets the strategic objectives and regularly reviews the activities of the Bank.\n\n\nPortfolio Composition\n\n\nOur balance sheet assets are a mix of fixed and variable rate assets with consumer indirect loans, commercial loans, and MBSs comprising a significant portion of our assets. Our consumer indirect loan portfolio comprised 17% of assets and is primarily fixed rate loans with relatively short durations. Our commercial loan portfolio totaled 37% of assets and is a combination of fixed and variable rate loans, lines and mortgages. The MBS portfolio, including collateralized mortgages obligations, totaled 23% of assets with durations averaging three to five years.\n\n\nOur liabilities are comprised primarily of deposits, which account for 96% of total liabilities. Of these deposits, the majority, or 50%, is in nonpublic variable rate and noninterest bearing products including demand (both noninterest- and interest- bearing), savings and money market accounts. In addition, fixed rate nonpublic certificate of deposit products comprise 6% of total deposits. The Bank also has a significant amount of public deposits, which represented 23% of total deposits as of December 31, 2021.\n\n\nNet Interest Income at Risk\n\n\nA primary tool used to manage interest rate risk is \u201crate shock\u201d simulation to measure the rate sensitivity. Rate shock simulation is a modeling technique used to estimate the impact of changes in rates on net interest income as well as economic value of equity.\n\n\nNet interest income at risk is measured by estimating the changes in net interest income resulting from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in interest rates of different magnitudes over a period of 12 months. The following table sets forth the estimated changes to net interest income over the 12-month period ending December 31, 2022 assuming instantaneous changes in interest rates for the given rate shock scenarios (dollars in thousands):\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nChanges in Interest Rate\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n-100 bp\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n+100 bp\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n+200 bp\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n+300 bp\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated change in net interest income\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n(3,875\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n548\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n1,346\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n2,035\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n% Change\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n(2.63\n\n\n)%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.37\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.91\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1.38\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIn the rising rate scenarios, the model results indicate that net interest income is modeled to increase compared to the flat rate scenario over a one-year timeframe. This is a result of assumed commercial loan products and investment security cash flow repricing at a higher frequency than underlying borrowing and deposit costs. As intermediate and longer-term assets continue to mature and are replaced at higher yields, net interest income improves over longer term timeframes. Model results in the declining rate scenario indicate decreases in net interest income due to assets having the ability to reprice downward, while deposit and borrowing liabilities reach modeled floors.\n\n\nIn addition to the changes in interest rate scenarios listed above, other scenarios are typically modeled to measure interest rate risk. These scenarios vary depending on the economic and interest rate environment.\n\n\nThe simulation referenced above is based on our assumption as to the effect of interest rate changes on assets and liabilities and assumes a parallel shift of the yield curve. It also includes certain assumptions about the future pricing of loans and deposits in response to changes in interest rates. Further, it assumes that delinquency rates would not change as a result of changes in interest rates, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case. While this simulation is a useful measure as to net interest income at risk due to a change in interest rates, it is not a forecast of the future results, does not measure the effect of changing interest rates on noninterest income and is based on many assumptions that, if changed, could cause a different outcome.\n\n\n-\n \n62\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEconomic Value of Equity At Risk\n\n\nThe economic (or \u201cfair\u201d) value of financial instruments on our balance sheet will also vary under the interest rate scenarios previously discussed. This variance is measured by simulating changes in our economic value of equity (\u201cEVE\u201d), which is calculated by subtracting the estimated fair value of liabilities from the estimated fair value of assets. Fair values for financial instruments are estimated by discounting projected cash flows (principal and interest) at current replacement rates for each account type, while fair values of non-financial assets and liabilities are assumed to equal book value and do not vary with interest rate fluctuations. An economic value simulation is a static measure for balance sheet accounts at a given point in time, but this measurement can change substantially over time as the characteristics of our balance sheet evolve and as interest rate and yield curve assumptions are updated.\n\n\nThe amount of change in economic value under different interest rate scenarios depends on the characteristics of each class of financial instrument, including the stated interest rate or spread relative to current market rates or spreads, the likelihood of prepayment, whether the rate is fixed or floating, and the maturity date of the instrument. As a general rule, fixed-rate financial assets become more valuable in declining rate scenarios and less valuable in rising rate scenarios, while fixed-rate financial liabilities gain in value as interest rates rise and lose value as interest rates decline. The longer the duration of the financial instrument, the greater the impact a rate change will have on its value. In our economic value simulations, estimated prepayments are factored in for financial instruments with stated maturity dates, and decay rates for non-maturity deposits are projected based on historical data, based on third-party review and inputs.\n\n\nThe analysis that follows presents the estimated EVE resulting from market interest rates prevailing at a given quarter-end (\u201cPre-Shock Scenario\u201d), and under other interest rate scenarios (each a \u201cRate Shock Scenario\u201d) represented by immediate, permanent, parallel shifts in interest rates from those observed at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The analysis additionally presents a measurement of the interest rate sensitivity at December 31, 2021 and 2020. EVE amounts are computed under each respective Pre-Shock Scenario and Rate Shock Scenario. An increase in the EVE amount is considered favorable, while a decline is considered unfavorable.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDecember 31, 2021\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDecember 31, 2020\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRate Shock Scenario:\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEVE\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nChange\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPercentage\nChange\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nEVE\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nChange\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPercentage\nChange\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-Shock Scenario\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n775,697\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n583,156\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- 100 Basis Points\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n746,770\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n(28,927\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n-3.73\n\n\n%\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n574,345\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n$\n\n\n(8,811\n\n\n)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n-1.51\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+ 100 Basis Points\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n782,438\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n6,741\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n0.87\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n617,768\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n34,612\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n5.94\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+ 200 Basis Points\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n786,362\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n10,665\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1.37\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n638,224\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n55,068\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n9.44\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+ 300 Basis Points\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n784,923\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n9,226\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1.19\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n651,518\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n68,362\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n11.72\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe Pre-Shock Scenario EVE was $775.7 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $583.2 million at December 31, 2020. The increase in the Pre-Shock Scenario EVE at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 resulted primarily from growth in our investment securities portfolio, which is also the driver for the increased EVE Up Rate Shock Scenarios. The increase in sensitivity in the -100 basis point Rate Shock Scenario to EVE is a result of rates rising on a linked year basis, allowing for more sensitivity to downward rate movements.  The sensitivity is further compounded by growth of fixed-rate long term assets which are not receiving the full value appreciation typically observed in down rate scenarios, due to discount rate flooring assumptions, coupled with continued growth of deposits through 2021.\n\n\n-\n \n63\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInterest Rate Sensitivity Gap\n\n\nThe following table presents an analysis of our interest rate sensitivity gap position at December 31, 2021. All interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are shown based on the earlier of their contractual maturity or re-pricing date. The expected maturities are presented on a contractual basis or, if more relevant, based on projected call dates. Investment securities are at amortized cost for both securities available for sale and securities held to maturity. Loans, net of deferred loan origination costs, include principal amortization adjusted for estimated prepayments (principal payments in excess of contractual amounts) and non-accruing loans. Because the interest rate sensitivity levels shown in the table could be changed by external factors such as loan prepayments and liability decay rates or by factors controllable by us, such as asset sales, it is not an absolute reflection of our potential interest rate risk profile (in thousands).\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAt December 31,

gap analysis. We consider the net interest income at risk simulation modeling to be more informative in forecasting future income at risk.\n\n\n-\n \n64\n -\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n", "companyName": "Financial Institutions Inc", "cusip": "81369Y506"}
