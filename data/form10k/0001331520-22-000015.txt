Our community banking team is built around experienced bankers with strong local relationships. The Company was formed in 1998 by an investor group led by John W. Allison, our Chairman, and Robert H. \u201cBunny\u201d Adcock, Jr., one of our directors. Since opening our first subsidiary bank in 1999, we have acquired and integrated a total of 22 banks with locations in Arkansas, Florida and Alabama, including 17 banks since 2010, seven of which we acquired through Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) assisted transactions. Our subsidiary bank has operated under a single charter and the Centennial Bank name since 2009. In 2015, after acquiring a pool of national commercial real estate loans, we created Centennial Commercial Finance Group (\u201cCentennial CFG\u201d) to build out a national lending platform focused on commercial real estate as well as commercial and industrial loans. Centennial CFG operates out of our New York City branch office and loan production offices in Los Angeles, California, Dallas, Texas and Miami, Florida. On June 30, 2018, we acquired Shore Premier Finance (\u201cSPF\u201d), a marine-lending division of Union Bank & Trust of Richmond, Virginia, and established the SPF division of Centennial Bank to build out a lending platform focusing on commercial and consumer marine loans. On February 29, 2020, we acquired LH-Finance, the marine lending division of People\u2019s United Bank, N.A. of Bridgeport, Connecticut, and consolidated LH-Finance and its loan portfolio with our SPF division. The SPF division operates out of loan production offices in Chesapeake, Virginia and Baltimore, Maryland. \nAcquisitions\nWe believe many individuals and businesses prefer banking with a locally managed community bank capable of providing flexibility and quick decisions. The execution of our community banking strategy has allowed us to rapidly build our network of banking operations through acquisitions. The following summary provides additional details concerning our acquisitions during the previous five fiscal years.\nGiant Holdings, Inc.\n \u2013 On February 23, 2017, the Company acquired Giant Holdings, Inc. (\u201cGHI\u201d), parent company of Landmark Bank, N.A. (\u201cLandmark\u201d), pursuant to a definitive agreement and plan of merger whereby GHI merged with and into HBI and, immediately thereafter, Landmark merged with and into Centennial Bank. The Company paid a purchase price to the GHI shareholders of approximately $96.0 million for the GHI acquisition. Under the terms of the agreement, shareholders of GHI received 2,738,038 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock valued at approximately $77.5 million as of February 23, 2017, plus approximately $18.5 million in cash in exchange for all outstanding shares of GHI common stock. \n5\nTable of \nContents\nGHI formerly operated six branch locations in the Ft. Lauderdale, Florida area. Including the effects of the purchase accounting adjustments, as of acquisition date, GHI had approximately $398.1 million in total assets, $327.8 million in loans after $8.1 million of loan discounts, and $304.0 million in deposits.\nThe Bank of Commerce\n \u2013 On February 28, 2017, the Company purchased all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of The Bank of Commerce, a Florida state-chartered bank that operated in the Sarasota, Florida area (\u201cBOC\u201d), pursuant to an acquisition agreement, dated December 1, 2016, by and between HBI and Bank of Commerce Holdings, Inc. (\u201cBCHI\u201d), parent company of BOC. The Company merged BOC with and into Centennial Bank effective as of the close of business on February 28, 2017.\nThe acquisition of BOC was conducted in accordance with the provisions of Section 363 of the United States Bankruptcy Code pursuant to a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code filed by BCHI with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Florida (the \u201cBankruptcy Court\u201d). The sale of BOC by BCHI was subject to certain bidding procedures approved by the Bankruptcy Court, under which the Company was deemed to be the successful bidder. \nUnder the terms of the acquisition agreement, the Company paid an aggregate of approximately $4.2 million in cash for the acquisition, which included the purchase of all outstanding shares of BOC common stock, the discounted purchase of certain subordinated debentures issued by BOC from the existing holders of the subordinated debentures, and an expense reimbursement to BCHI for approved administrative claims in connection with the bankruptcy proceeding.\nBOC formerly operated three branch locations in the Sarasota, Florida area. Including the effects of the purchase accounting adjustments, as of acquisition date, BOC had approximately $178.1 million in total assets, $118.5 million in loans after $5.8 million of loan discounts, and $139.8 million in deposits.\nStonegate Bank\n \u2013 On September 26, 2017, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Stonegate Bank (\u201cStonegate\u201d), and merged Stonegate into Centennial Bank. The Company paid a purchase price to the Stonegate shareholders of approximately $792.4 million for the Stonegate acquisition. Under the terms of the merger agreement, shareholders of Stonegate received 30,863,658 shares of HBI common stock valued at approximately $742.3 million at the time of closing plus approximately $50.1 million in cash in exchange for all outstanding shares of Stonegate common stock. In addition, the holders of outstanding stock options of Stonegate received approximately $27.6 million in cash in connection with the cancellation of their options immediately before the acquisition closed, for a total transaction value of approximately $820.0 million. \nIncluding the effects of the purchase accounting adjustments, as of acquisition date, Stonegate had approximately $2.89 billion in total assets, $2.37 billion in loans and $2.53 billion in customer deposits. Stonegate formerly operated its banking business from 24 locations in key Florida markets with significant presence in Broward and Sarasota counties.\nShore Premier Finance \n\u2013 On June 30, 2018, the Company acquired Shore Premier Finance (\u201cSPF\u201d), a division of Union Bank & Trust of Richmond, Virginia, the bank subsidiary of Union Bankshares Corporation. The Company paid a purchase price of approximately $377.4 million in cash, subject to certain post-closing adjustments, and 1,250,000 shares of HBI common stock valued at approximately $28.2 million at the time of the acquisition. SPF provides direct consumer financing for United States Coast Guard (\u201cUSCG\u201d) registered high-end sail and power boats. Additionally, SPF provides inventory floor plan lines of credit to marine dealers, primarily those selling USCG documented vessels. \nIncluding the purchase accounting adjustments, as of acquisition date, SPF had approximately $377.0 million in total assets, including $376.2 million in total loans, which resulted in goodwill of $30.5 million being recorded. \nThis portfolio of loans is now housed in a division of Centennial Bank known as Shore Premier Finance. The SPF division of Centennial Bank is responsible for servicing the acquired loan portfolio and originating new loan production. In connection with this acquisition, Centennial Bank opened a new loan production office in Chesapeake, Virginia, to house the SPF division. Through the SPF division, Centennial Bank is working to build out a lending platform focusing on commercial and consumer marine loans. \nLH-Finance \n\u2013 On February 29, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of LH-Finance, the marine lending division of People\u2019s United Bank, N.A., for a cash purchase price of approximately $421.2 million. Like SPF, LH-Finance provides direct consumer financing for USCG registered high-end sail and power boats, as well as inventory floor plan lines of credit to marine dealers, primarily those selling USCG documented vessels.\n6\nTable of \nContents\nIncluding the purchase accounting adjustments, as of the acquisition date, LH-Finance had approximately $409.1 million in total assets, including $407.4 million in total loans, which resulted in goodwill of $14.6 million being recorded.\nThe acquired portfolio of loans is now housed in our SPF division. The SPF division is responsible for servicing the acquired loan portfolio and originating new loan production. In connection with this acquisition, we opened a new loan production office in Baltimore, Maryland.\nHappy Bancshares, Inc.\n \u2013 On September 15, 2021, the Company and Centennial entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) with Happy Bancshares, Inc., a Texas corporation (\u201cHappy\u201d), and its wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Happy State Bank, a Texas banking association (\u201cHSB\u201d), under which the Company and Centennial will acquire Happy and HSB. The Agreement, as amended on October 18, 2021 and further amended on November 8, 2021, provides that, in a series of transactions, an acquisition subsidiary of the Company will merge into Happy and Happy will merge into the Company, with the Company as the surviving entity (collectively, the \u201cMerger\u201d). As soon as reasonably practicable following the Merger, HSB will merge into Centennial, with Centennial as the surviving entity.\n Under the terms of the Agreement, as amended, the Company will issue approximately 42.3\u00a0million shares of its common stock to the shareholders of Happy upon the completion of the Merger. No cash consideration will be paid in connection with the Merger, except that holders of outstanding shares of Happy common stock at the time of the Merger will receive cash payments in lieu of any fractional shares of Company common stock to which they are otherwise entitled in connection with the Merger. In addition, the Company expects to pay an aggregate of up to approximately $11.0\u00a0million in cash in cancellation of certain stock appreciation rights issued by Happy that remain outstanding at the time of the Merger.   \n Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement, as amended, at the effective time of the Merger (the \u201cEffective Time\u201d), each outstanding share of common stock of Happy will be converted into the right to receive, without interest, 2.17 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock (the \u201cMerger Consideration\u201d). Each unvested restricted share of Happy common stock outstanding at the Effective Time will fully vest and be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. In addition, at the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Happy common stock will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the number of whole shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares, equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Happy common stock subject to the option, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration value over the exercise price of the option, less applicable tax withholdings, divided by (iii) the Company\u2019s Average Closing Price (defined below). Similarly, each stock appreciation right of Happy outstanding at the Effective Time will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Happy common stock subject to the stock appreciation right, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration value over the grant price of the stock appreciation right, less applicable tax withholdings. For purposes of these calculations, the Merger Consideration value will be determined using a volume-weighted average closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange over the 20 consecutive trading day period ending on the third business day prior to the closing of the Merger (\u201cthe Company\u2019s Average Closing Price\u201d), multiplied by 2.17. \nThe Merger is expected to close during the first quarter of 2022, and is subject to regulatory approvals and other conditions set forth in the Agreement. The Company received approval for the merger from the Arkansas State Banking Board and the Arkansas State Bank Commissioner as well as the approval of the shareholders of each company in December of 2021.\nFor an additional discussion regarding the acquisition of LH-Finance see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and Note 2 \u201cBusiness Combinations\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021.

Carter, III\n46\nExecutive Officer\nRegional President\nOur Growth Strategy\nOur goals are to achieve growth in earnings per share and to create and build stockholder value. Our growth strategy entails the following:\n\u2022\nStrategic acquisitions\n \u2013 Strategic acquisitions (both FDIC-assisted and non-FDIC-assisted) have been a significant component of our historical growth strategy, and we believe properly priced bank acquisitions can continue to be a large part of our growth strategy. We currently anticipate completing our proposed acquisition of Happy Bancshares, Inc. headquartered in Amarillo, Texas, during the first quarter of 2022. Upon the completion and successful integration of Happy, our principal acquisition focus in the near term will be to expand our presence in Texas, Arkansas, Florida and Alabama and into other contiguous markets, although we may seek to expand into other areas if attractive financial opportunities in other market areas arise. We will continue to evaluate potential bank acquisition opportunities to determine whether they are in the best interests of our Company. Our goals in making these decisions are to maximize the return to our shareholders and to enhance our franchise.\n\u2022\nOrganic growth \n\u2013 We believe our current branch network provides us with the capacity to grow within our existing market areas. We also believe we are well positioned to attract new business and additional experienced personnel as a result of ongoing changes in our competitive markets. We believe the markets we entered into as a result of historical acquisitions provide us opportunities for organic growth as we now have a presence in several large markets where our market share has not previously been significant. Through our Centennial CFG franchise, we are continuing to build out a national lending platform that focuses on commercial real estate plus commercial and industrial loans. Additionally, through our SPF division, we are continuing to build a lending platform focusing on commercial and consumer marine loans. As opportunities arise, we will evaluate new (commonly referred to as \nde novo\n) branches in our current markets and in other attractive market areas. We did not open any \nde novo\n branch locations during 2021. We will continue to evaluate \nde novo\n opportunities during 2022 and make decisions on a case-by-case basis in the best interest of the shareholders. \n8\nTable of \nContents\nCommunity Banking Philosophy \nOur community banking philosophy consists of four basic principles:\n\u2022\nmanage our community banking franchise with experienced bankers and community bank boards who are empowered to make customer-related decisions quickly;\n\u2022\nprovide exceptional service and develop strong customer relationships;\n\u2022\npursue the business relationships of our local boards of directors, executive officers, stockholders, and customers to actively promote our community bank; and\n\u2022\nmaintain our commitment to the communities we serve by supporting civic and nonprofit organizations. \nThese principles, which make up our community banking philosophy, are the driving force for our business. As we streamlined our legacy business into an efficient banking network and have integrated new acquisitions, we have preserved lending authority with local management in most cases by using local loan committees that maintain an integral connection to the communities we serve. These committees are empowered with lending authority of up to $6.0 million in their respective geographic areas. This allows us to capitalize on the strong relationships that these individuals and our local bank officers have in their respective communities to maintain and grow our business. Through experienced and empowered local bankers and board members, we are committed to maintaining a community banking experience for our customers. \nOperating Goals\nOur operating goals focus on maintaining strong credit quality, increasing profitability, finding experienced bankers, and maintaining a \u201cfortress\u201d balance sheet:\n\u2022\nMaintain strong credit quality \n\u2013 Credit quality is our first priority. We employ a set of credit standards designed to ensure the proper management of credit risk. Our management team plays an active role in monitoring compliance with these credit standards in the different communities served by Centennial Bank. We have a centralized loan review process, which we believe enables us to take prompt action on potential problem loans. We have historically taken an aggressive approach to resolving problem loans, including those problem loans acquired in our FDIC-assisted and non-FDIC-assisted acquisitions. We are committed to maintaining high credit quality standards. \n\u2022\nContinue to improve profitability \n\u2013 We will continue to strive to improve our profitability and achieve high performance ratios as we continue to utilize the available capacity of branches and employees. We believe our profitability is significantly tied to our focus on our efficiency ratio, and we pride ourselves on operating in a highly efficient manner. To achieve further improvements in operating efficiency, we will continue to focus on increasing revenue from organic loan growth, achieving cost savings from any acquisitions, developing and implementing new efficiency initiatives, further streamlining the processes in our lending and retail operations and improving our purchasing power.\n\u2022\nAttract and motivate experienced bankers \n\u2013 We believe a major factor in our success has been our ability to attract and motivate bankers who have experience in and knowledge of their local communities. Historically, our hiring and retaining experienced relationship bankers has been integral to our ability to grow quickly when entering new markets. \n\u2022\nMaintain a \u201cfortress\u201d balance sheet \n\u2013 We intend to maintain a strong balance sheet through a focus on four key governing principles: (1) maintain solid asset quality; (2) remain well-capitalized; (3) pursue high performance metrics including return on tangible equity (ROTE), return on assets (ROA), efficiency ratio and net interest margin; and (4) retain liquidity at the bank holding company level that can be utilized should attractive acquisition opportunities be identified or for internal capital needs. We strive to maintain capital levels above the regulatory capital requirements through our focus on these governing principles, which historically has allowed us to take advantage of acquisition opportunities as they become available without the need for additional capital.\n9\nTable of \nContents\nOur Market Areas\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, we conducted business principally through 76 branches in Arkansas, 78 branches in Florida, five branches in Alabama and one branch in New York City. Our branch footprint includes markets in which we are the deposit market share leader as well as markets where we believe we have opportunities for deposit market share growth. As of December\u00a031, 2021, we also operate loan production offices in Los Angeles, California; Miami, Florida and Dallas, Texas through our Centennial CFG division and in Chesapeake, Virginia and Baltimore, Maryland through our SPF division.\nLending Activities\nWe originate loans primarily secured by single and multi-family real estate, residential construction and commercial buildings. In addition, we make loans to small and medium-sized commercial businesses as well as to consumers for a variety of purposes.\nOur loan portfolio as of December\u00a031, 2021, was comprised as follows:\nTotal\nLoans\nReceivable\nPercentage\nof portfolio\n(Dollars in thousands)\nReal estate:\nCommercial real estate loans\nNon-farm/non-residential\n$\n3,889,284\u00a0\n39.5\u00a0\n%\nConstruction/land development\n1,850,050\u00a0\n18.8\u00a0\nAgricultural\n130,674\u00a0\n1.3\u00a0\nResidential real estate loans\nResidential 1-4 family\n1,274,953\u00a0\n13.0\u00a0\nMultifamily residential\n280,837\u00a0\n2.9\u00a0\nTotal real estate\n7,425,798\u00a0\n75.5\u00a0\nConsumer\n825,519\u00a0\n8.4\u00a0\nCommercial and industrial\n1,386,747\u00a0\n14.1\u00a0\nAgricultural\n43,920\u00a0\n0.4\u00a0\nOther\n154,105\u00a0\n1.6\u00a0\nTotal\n$\n9,836,089\u00a0\n100.0\u00a0\n%\nReal Estate \u2013 Non-farm/Non-residential. \nNon-farm/non-residential real estate loans consist primarily of loans secured by income-producing properties, such as shopping/retail centers, hotel/motel properties, office buildings, and industrial/warehouse properties. Commercial lending on income-producing properties typically involves higher loan principal amounts, and the repayment of these loans is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties collateralizing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. This category of loans also includes specialized properties such as churches, marinas, and nursing homes. Additionally, we make commercial mortgage loans to entities to operate in these types of properties, and the repayment of these loans is dependent, in large part, on the cash flow generated by these entities in the operations of the business. Often, a secondary source of repayment will include the sale of the subject collateral. When this is the case, it is generally our practice to obtain an independent appraisal of this collateral within the Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines.\nReal Estate \u2013 Construction/Land Development. \nThis category of loans includes loans to residential and commercial developers to purchase raw land and to develop this land into residential and commercial land developments. In addition, this category includes construction loans for all of the types of real estate loans, including both commercial and residential. These loans are generally secured by a first lien on the real estate being purchased or developed. Often, the primary source of repayment will be the sale of the subject collateral. When this is the case, it is generally our practice to obtain an independent appraisal of this collateral within the Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines.\n10\nTable of \nContents\nReal Estate \u2013 Residential. \nOur residential mortgage loan program primarily originates loans to individuals for the purchase of residential property. We generally do not retain long-term, fixed-rate residential real estate loans in our portfolio due to interest rate and collateral risks. Residential mortgage loans to individuals retained in our loan portfolio primarily consisted of approximately 35.6% owner occupied 1-4 family properties and approximately 52.1% non-owner occupied 1-4 family properties (rental) as of December\u00a031, 2021 with the remaining 12.3% relating to condos and mobile homes. The primary source of repayment for these loans is generally the income and/or assets of the individual to whom the loan is made. Often, a secondary source of repayment will include the sale of the subject collateral. When this is the case, it is generally our practice to obtain an independent appraisal of this collateral within the Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines\n.\nConsumer. \nWhile our focus is on service to small and medium-sized businesses, we also make a variety of loans to individuals for personal, family and household purposes, including secured and unsecured installment and term loans originated by our bank, the primary portion of which consists of loans to finance USCG registered high-end sail and power boats through our SPF division. The primary source of repayment for these loans is generally the income and/or assets of the individual to whom the loan is made. The performance of consumer loans will be affected by the local and regional economies as well as the rates of personal bankruptcies, job loss, divorce and other individual-specific characteristics. When secured, we may independently assess the value of the collateral using a third-party valuation source.\nCommercial and Industrial. \nOur commercial and industrial loan portfolio primarily consisted of 22.6% unsecured loans, 39.1% inventory/accounts receivable financing, 9.0% equipment/vehicle financing and 29.3% other, including letters of credit at less than 1%, as of December\u00a031, 2021.  This category includes loans to smaller business ventures, credit lines for working capital and short-term inventory financing, for example. These loans are typically secured by the assets of the business and are supplemented by personal guaranties of the principals and often mortgages on the principals\u2019 primary residences. The primary source of repayment may be conversion of the assets into cash flow, as in inventory and accounts receivable, or may be cash flow generated by operations, as in equipment/vehicle financing. Assessing the value of inventory can involve many factors including, but not limited to, type, age, condition, level of conversion and marketability, and can involve applying a discount factor or obtaining an independent valuation, based on the assessment of the above factors. Assessing the value of accounts receivable can involve many factors including, but not limited to, concentration, aging, and industry, and can involve applying a discount factor or obtaining an independent valuation, based on the assessment of the above factors. Assessing the value of equipment/vehicles may involve a third-party valuation source, where applicable.\nAgricultural Loans.\n Agricultural loans include loans for financing agricultural production, including loans to businesses or individuals engaged in the production of timber, poultry, livestock or crops and are not categorized as part of real estate loans. Our agricultural loans are generally secured by farm machinery, livestock, crops, vehicles or other agricultural-related collateral. A portion of our portfolio of agricultural loans is comprised of loans to individuals which would normally be characterized as consumer loans except for the fact that the individual borrowers are primarily engaged in the production of timber, poultry, livestock or crops. \nPaycheck Protection Program.\n On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was passed by Congress and signed into law in response to the initial economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES\u201d Act) established a new federal economic relief program administered by the Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) called the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d), which provides for 100% federally guaranteed loans to be issued by participating private financial institutions to small businesses for payroll and certain other permitted expenses.  PPP loans are forgivable, in whole or in part, so long as employee and compensation levels of the borrower are maintained, and the proceeds are used for payroll and other permitted purposes in accordance with the requirements of the PPP. These loans carry a fixed rate of 1.00% and a term of two years, if not forgiven, in whole or in part. Payments were deferred for the first six months of the loan. The Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (\u201cPPP/HCEA Act\u201d) was signed into law in April 2020. The PPP/HCEA Act authorizes additional funds under the CARES Act for PPP loans to be issued by financial institutions through the SBA. The Consolidated Appropriations Act (\u201cCAA\u201d) was signed into law in December 2020. The CAA also authorizes additional funds under the CARES Act for PPP loans to be issued by financial institutions through the SBA with a term of five years.  As of December\u00a031, 2021, as a participating lender, we have generated 12,971 loans to both existing and new customers totaling $1.23 billion. As of December\u00a031, 2021, the outstanding PPP loan balances were $112.8\u00a0million. The average loan size was $131,000.\n11\nTable of \nContents\nCredit Risks. \nThe principal economic risk associated with each category of the loans that we make is the creditworthiness of the borrower and the ability of the borrower to repay the loan. General economic conditions and the strength of the services and retail market segments affect borrower creditworthiness. General factors affecting a commercial borrower\u2019s ability to repay include interest rates, inflation and the demand for the commercial borrower\u2019s products and services as well as other factors affecting a borrower\u2019s customers, suppliers and employees.\nRisks associated with real estate loans also include fluctuations in the value of real estate, new job creation trends, tenant vacancy rates, and in the case of commercial borrowers, the quality of the borrower\u2019s management. Consumer loan repayments depend upon the borrower\u2019s financial stability and are more likely to be adversely affected by divorce, job loss, illness and other personal hardships.\nLending Policies.\n We have established common loan documentation procedures and policies, based on the type of loan, for our bank subsidiary. The board of directors periodically reviews these policies for validity. In addition, it has been and will continue to be our practice to attempt to independently verify information provided by our borrowers, including assets and income. We have not made loans similar to those commonly referred to as \u201cno doc\u201d or \u201cstated income\u201d loans. We focus on the primary and secondary methods of repayment and prepare global cash flows where appropriate. There are legal restrictions on the dollar amount of loans available for each lending relationship. The Arkansas Banking Code provides that no loan relationship may exceed 20% of a bank\u2019s risk-based capital, and we are in compliance with this restriction. In addition, we are not dependent upon any single lending relationship for an amount exceeding 10% of our revenues. As of December\u00a031, 2021, the maximum amount outstanding to a single borrower was $230.9 million. As primarily a community lender, we believe from time to time it is in our best interest to agree to modifications or restructurings. These modifications/restructurings can take the form of a reduction in interest rate, a move to interest-only from principal and interest payments, or a lengthening in the amortization period or any combination thereof. Occasionally, we will modify/restructure a single loan by splitting it into two loans following the interagency guidance involving the workout of commercial real estate loans. The loan representing the portion that is supported by the current cash flow of the borrower or project will remain on our books, while the new loan representing the portion that cannot be serviced by the current cash flow is charged-off. Furthermore, we may make an additional loan or loans to a borrower or related interest of a borrower who is past due more than 90 days. These circumstances will be very limited in nature, and when approved by the appropriate lending authority, will likely involve obtaining additional collateral that will improve the collectability of the overall relationship. It is our belief that judicious usage of these tools can improve the quality of our loan portfolio by providing our borrowers an improved probability of survival during difficult economic times. \nLoan Approval Procedures. \nOur bank subsidiary has supplemented our common loan policies to establish its loan approval procedures as follows:\n\u2022\nIndividual Authorities. \nThe board of directors of Centennial Bank establishes the authorization levels for individual loan officers on a case-by-case basis. Generally, the more experienced a loan officer, the higher the authorization level. The approval authority for individual loan officers ranges from $15,000 to $1.0 million for secured loans and from $1,000 to $100,000 for unsecured loans. \n\u2022\nOfficers\u2019 Loan Committees. \nOur bank subsidiary also gives its Officers\u2019 Loan Committees loan approval authority. Credits in excess of individual loan limits are submitted to the region\u2019s Officers\u2019 Loan Committee. The Officers\u2019 Loan Committee consists of members of the senior management team of that region and is chaired by that region\u2019s chief lending officer. The regional Officers\u2019 Loan Committees have approval authority of up to $2.0 million secured on all loans and $100,000 unsecured on loan renewals. \n\u2022\nDirectors\u2019 Loan Committee. \nOur bank subsidiary has Directors\u2019 Loan Committees (\u201cDLCs\u201d) throughout our market areas consisting of outside directors and senior lenders of the respective market areas. Generally, each DLC requires a majority of outside directors be present to establish a quorum. Generally, this committee is chaired either by the Division Chief Lending Officer or the Regional President. The regional DLCs have approval authority up to $6.0 million secured and $500,000 unsecured. \n\u2022\nExecutive Loan Committee \u2013 \nThe board of directors of Centennial Bank established the Executive Loan Committee consisting of outside board members and members of executive management. This committee requires five voting members to establish a quorum, including at least two of the outside board members, and is chaired by the Chief Lending Officer of the bank. The Executive Loan Committee has approval authority up to the Bank\u2019s legal lending limit, subject to exception approval by the full Board for single loans over $100 million or relationships over $200 million. In addition, any relationship above $20 million must have the specific approval of both the Chairman and our director Richard H. Ashley.\n12\nTable of \nContents\nCurrently, our board of directors has established an in-house consolidated lending limit of $20.0 million to any one borrowing relationship without obtaining the approval of both our Chairman and our director Richard H. Ashley. We have 109 separate relationships that exceed this in-house limit.\nDeposits and Other Sources of Funds\nOur principal source of funds for loans and investing in securities is core deposits. We offer a wide range of deposit services, including checking, savings, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. We obtain most of our deposits from individuals and small businesses, and municipalities in our market areas. We believe that the rates we offer for core deposits are competitive with those offered by other financial institutions in our market areas. Additionally, our policy also permits the acceptance of brokered deposits. Secondary sources of funding include advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window and other borrowings. These secondary sources enable us to borrow funds at rates and terms which, at times, are more beneficial to us.\nOther Banking Services\nGiven customer demand for increased convenience and account access, we offer a range of products and services, including 24-hour internet banking, mobile banking and voice response information, cash management, overdraft protection, direct deposit, safe deposit boxes, United States savings bonds and automatic account transfers. We earn fees for most of these services. We also receive ATM transaction fees from transactions performed by our customers participating in a shared network of automated teller machines and a debit card system that our customers can use throughout the United States, as well as in other countries.\nInsurance\nCentennial Insurance Agency, Inc. is an independent insurance agency, originally founded in 1959 and purchased by Centennial Bank in 2000. Centennial Insurance Agency writes policies for commercial and personal lines of business including insurance for property, casualty, life, health and employee benefits. It is subject to regulation by the Arkansas Insurance Department. The offices of Centennial Insurance Agency are currently located in Jacksonville, Cabot and Conway, Arkansas. \nCook Insurance Agency, Inc. is an independent insurance agency, originally founded in 1913 and acquired by Centennial Bank in 2010 during our FDIC-assisted acquisition of Gulf State Community Bank. Cook Insurance Agency writes policies for commercial and personal lines of business including life insurance. It is subject to regulation by the Florida Insurance Department. The offices of Cook Insurance Agency are located in Apalachicola and Crawfordville, Florida.\nCompetition\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, we conducted business through\n \n160 branch locations\n \nin our primary market areas of Pulaski, Faulkner, Craighead, Lonoke, Pope, Washington, White, Benton, Greene, Sebastian, Cleburne, Independence, Stone, Baxter, Clay, Conway, Crawford, Johnson, Saline, Sharp and Yell counties in Arkansas; Broward, Monroe, Hillsborough, Leon, Sarasota, Bay, Franklin, Palm Beach, Gulf, Charlotte, Collier, Escambia, Orange, Osceola, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk, Walton, Miami-Dade, Lee, Calhoun, Gadsden, Hernando, Liberty, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa, Seminole, Wakulla and Manatee counties in Florida; Baldwin County in Alabama; and New York County in New York. Many other commercial banks, savings institutions and credit unions have offices in our primary market areas. These institutions include many of the largest banks operating in these respective states, including some of the largest banks in the country. Many of our competitors serve the same counties we do. Our competitors often have greater resources, have broader geographic markets, have higher lending limits, offer various services that we may not currently offer and may better afford and make broader use of media advertising, support services and electronic technology than we do. To offset these competitive disadvantages, we depend on our reputation as having greater personal service, consistency, and flexibility and the ability to make credit and other business decisions quickly.\n13\nTable of \nContents\nHuman Capital Resources\nGeneral. \nOur community banking philosophy relies heavily on the personal relationships and the quality of service provided by employees. We rely on experienced bankers and community bank boards who are empowered to make customer-related decisions quickly. Experienced and empowered local bankers and board members facilitate our commitment to provide exceptional service and develop strong customer relationships. At the local level, we have preserved lending authority by using local loan committees that maintain an integral connection to the communities we serve, which allows us to capitalize on the strong relationships that these individuals and our local bank officers have in their respective communities to maintain and grow our business. Accordingly, we aim to attract, develop and retain employees who can drive financial and strategic growth objectives and build long-term shareholder value while executing our community banking philosophy.\nOn December\u00a031, 2021, we had 1,992 full-time equivalent employees. Except for any additional employees acquired in future acquisitions, we expect that our 2022 staffing levels will be slightly higher than those at year end 2021 to meet increased regulatory requirements. We consider our employee relations to be good, and we have no collective bargaining agreements with any employees.\nIn managing the Company\u2019s business, management focuses on various human capital measures and objectives designed to address the development, attraction and retention of personnel. These include competitive compensation and benefits, paid time off, an employee retirement plan, bonus and other incentive compensation plans, modern equipment and support, leadership development and professional development as well as those benefits described below.\nDiversity and Inclusion.\n We seek to recognize the unique contribution each individual brings to the Company, and we understand the associated value that comes with a diverse workforce. We strive to offer an inclusive environment where employees from all backgrounds can succeed. As of December\u00a031, 2021, 70% of our employees were women and 19% of our employees identify as a person of color. Further, as of December\u00a031, 2021, 61% of the Company\u2019s leadership positions were held by women.\nEmployee Safety and Health.\n The health and well-being of our employees is a priority for our business. Our full-time officers and employees are provided hospitalization and major medical insurance. We pay a substantial part of the premiums for these coverages. We also provide other basic insurance coverage including dental, life, and long-term disability insurance.\nIn response to COVID-19, to support the health and well-being of our employees, we continue to support working remotely.  Beyond these efforts to support working remotely, departments were spread out to adhere to social distancing guidelines and personal protection equipment in the form of gloves, masks and hand sanitizer were routinely delivered to all of our banking facilities. In addition, all employees who were required or mandated to be quarantined or who chose to self-quarantine due to exposure received emergency paid time off. In the event of a daycare or school closing and the employee needed to care for their children or legal dependent(s), employees were authorized to utilize a telework arrangement, an alternative work schedule or emergency paid time off.\nSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\nGeneral\nWe and our bank subsidiary are subject to extensive state and federal banking regulations that impose restrictions on and provide for general regulatory oversight of our company and its operations. These laws generally are intended to protect depositors, the deposit insurance fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) and the banking system as a whole, and not shareholders. \nThe following discussion describes the material elements of the regulatory framework that applies to us. This description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations and policies that are described. Also, such statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to us and our subsidiaries could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Because our bank subsidiary\u2019s total assets exceed $10 billion, it is subject to additional supervision and regulation, including by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d), with such additional supervision and regulation discussed throughout this section.\n14\nTable of \nContents\nFinancial Regulatory Reform\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) made extensive changes in the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act contains a comprehensive set of provisions designed to govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets. Some of these provisions are described in more detail below. Many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have delayed effective dates, and the legislation requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new rules and regulations, some of which have not yet been issued in final form. In addition, we and our bank subsidiary became subject to certain Dodd-Frank Act provisions for the first time in 2018 as our bank subsidiary\u2019s total assets exceeded $10 billion. We expect our operating and compliance costs to continue to increase as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and implementing its regulations. \nHome BancShares\nWe are a bank holding company registered under the federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the \u201cBank Holding Company Act\u201d) and are subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. The Bank Holding Company Act and other federal laws subject bank holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations.\nAcquisitions of Banks.\n The Bank Holding Company Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s prior approval before:\n\u2022\nacquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if, after the acquisition, the bank holding company will directly or indirectly own or control more than 5% of the bank\u2019s voting shares;\n\u2022\nacquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank; or\n\u2022\nmerging or consolidating with any other bank holding company.\nUnder the Bank Holding Company Act, if well-capitalized and well managed, we, as well as other bank holding companies located within the states in which we operate, may purchase a bank located outside of those states. Conversely, a well-capitalized and well managed bank holding company located outside of the states in which we operate may purchase a bank located inside those states. In each case, however, restrictions may be placed on the acquisition of a bank that has only been in existence for a limited amount of time or will result in specified concentrations of deposits. In approving bank acquisitions by bank holding companies, the Federal Reserve Board is required to consider, among other things, the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding company and the banks concerned, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served and various competitive factors.\nPermitted Activities. \nA bank holding company is generally permitted under the Bank Holding Company Act to engage in or acquire direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company engaged in the following activities:\n\u2022\nbanking or managing or controlling banks; and\n\u2022\nany activity that the Federal Reserve Board determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking.\nActivities that the Federal Reserve Board has found to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking include but are not limited to: factoring accounts receivable; making, acquiring, brokering or servicing loans and usual related activities; leasing personal or real property; operating a non-bank depository institution, such as a savings association; trust company functions; financial and investment advisory activities; conducting securities brokerage activities; underwriting and dealing in government obligations and money market instruments; providing specified management consulting and counseling activities; performing selected data processing services and support services; acting as agent or broker in selling credit life insurance and other types of insurance in connection with credit transactions; and performing selected insurance underwriting activities.\n15\nTable of \nContents\nSupport of Subsidiary Institutions. \nUnder the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to act as a source of financial strength for our bank subsidiary and to commit resources to support the bank. Under current federal law, the Federal Reserve may require us to make capital injections into our bank subsidiary and may charge us with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if we fail to commit resources to our bank subsidiary or if we undertake actions that the Federal Reserve believes might jeopardize our ability to commit resources to the bank. As a result, an obligation to support our bank subsidiary may be required at times when, without this requirement, we might not be inclined to provide it.\nSafe and Sound Banking Practices. \nBank holding companies are not permitted to engage in unsafe and unsound banking practices. The Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Regulation Y, for example, generally requires a holding company to give the Federal Reserve Board prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities, if the consideration to be paid, together with the consideration paid for any repurchases or redemptions in the preceding year, is equal to 10% or more of the company\u2019s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may oppose the transaction if it believes that the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law or regulation. Depending upon the circumstances, the Federal Reserve Board could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice.\nThe Federal Reserve Board has broad authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries which represent unsafe and unsound banking practices, or which constitute violations of laws or regulations, and can assess civil money penalties for certain activities conducted on a knowing and reckless basis, if those activities caused a substantial loss to a depository institution. The penalties can be as high as approximately $2 million for each day the activity continues.\nAnnual Reporting; Examinations. \nWe are required to file annual reports with the Federal Reserve Board, and such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act. The Federal Reserve Board may examine a bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries and charge the company for the cost of such examination.\nCapital Adequacy Requirements. \nThe Federal Reserve Board has adopted a system using risk-based capital guidelines to evaluate the capital adequacy of bank holding companies having $500 million or more in assets on a consolidated basis. Under the guidelines, specific categories of assets are assigned different risk weights, based generally on the perceived credit risk of the asset. These risk weights are multiplied by corresponding asset balances to determine a \u201crisk-weighted\u201d asset base. The guidelines in effect as of December\u00a031, 2021 require a minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% (of which at least 6.0% is required to consist of Tier 1 capital elements) and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10% (of which at least 8.0% is required to consist of Tier 1 capital elements) to be \u201cwell-capitalized.\u201d Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. As of December\u00a031, 2021, our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 15.98% and our total risk-based capital ratio was 19.77%. Thus, as of December\u00a031, 2021, we are considered well-capitalized for regulatory purposes.\nIn addition to the risk-based capital guidelines, the Federal Reserve Board uses a leverage ratio as an additional tool to evaluate the capital adequacy of bank holding companies. The leverage ratio is a company\u2019s Tier 1 capital divided by its average total consolidated assets. Certain highly-rated bank holding companies may maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 3.0%, but other bank holding companies are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4.0%. Well-capitalized is a leverage ratio in excess of 5%. As of December\u00a031, 2021, our leverage ratio was 11.11%.\nThe federal banking agencies\u2019 risk-based and leverage ratios are minimum supervisory ratios generally applicable to banking organizations that meet certain specified criteria. The federal bank regulatory agencies may set capital requirements for a particular banking organization that are higher than the minimum ratios when circumstances warrant. Federal Reserve Board guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions, substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets.\n16\nTable of \nContents\nThe Dodd-Frank Act includes certain provisions concerning the capital regulations of the federal banking agencies. These provisions, often referred to as the \u201cCollins Amendment,\u201d are intended to subject bank holding companies to the same capital requirements as their bank subsidiaries and to eliminate or significantly reduce the use of hybrid capital instruments, especially trust preferred securities, as regulatory capital. Under the Collins Amendment, trust preferred securities issued before May 19, 2010 by a company, such as our Company, with total consolidated assets of less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009, and treated as regulatory capital are grandfathered, but any such securities issued later are not eligible as regulatory capital. The Collins Amendment requires banking regulators to develop regulations setting minimum risk-based and leverage capital requirements for holding companies and banks on a consolidated basis that are no less stringent than the generally applicable requirements in effect for depository institutions under the prompt corrective action regulations discussed below. The banking regulators also must seek to make capital standards countercyclical so that the required levels of capital increase in times of economic expansion and decrease in times of economic contraction. \nIn July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule to revise their risk-based and leverage capital requirements and their method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with the agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in \u201cBasel III: A Global Regulatory Framework for More Resilient Banks and Banking Systems\u201d (\u201cBasel III\u201d) and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule applies to all depository institutions, bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $500 million or more and savings and loan holding companies (collectively, \u201cbanking organizations\u201d). Among other things, the rule established a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement (4.5% of risk-weighted assets) and a higher minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital requirement (6% of risk-weighted assets) and assigns higher risk weightings (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on non-accrual status and certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. As of December\u00a031, 2021, the Company\u2019s common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 15.37%. \nThe final rule permanently grandfathers trust preferred securities and other non-qualifying capital instruments that were issued and outstanding as of May 19, 2010 in the Tier 1 capital of bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009. The rule phases out of Tier 1 capital these non-qualifying capital instruments issued before May 19, 2010 by all other bank holding companies. Because our total consolidated assets were less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009, our outstanding trust preferred securities continue to be treated as Tier 1 capital. However, now that the Company has exceeded $15 billion in assets, the Tier 1 treatment of the Company\u2019s outstanding trust preferred securities will be phased out upon completion of the acquisition of Happy Bancshares, but these securities will still be treated as Tier 2 capital.\nThe final rule also limits a banking organization\u2019s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, which is in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The final rule became effective for the Company and our bank subsidiary on January 1, 2015. The capital conservation buffer requirement began being phased in on January 1, 2016, and the full capital conservation buffer requirement became effective January 1, 2019. As of December\u00a031, 2021, our capital conservation buffer was 9.98%.\nLiquidity Requirements. \nHistorically, the regulation and monitoring of bank and bank holding company liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter, without minimum required formulaic measures. The Basel III liquidity framework requires banks and bank holding companies to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests that, although similar in some respects to liquidity measures historically applied by banks and regulators for management and supervisory purposes, going forward would be required by regulation. One test, referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio, is designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to the entity\u2019s expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon (or, if greater, 25% of its expected total cash outflow) under an acute liquidity stress scenario. The other test, referred to as the net stable funding ratio, is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon. These requirements are expected to incent banking entities to increase their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets and increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source. The federal banking agencies have not determined to what extent they will apply to U.S. banks that are not large, internationally active banks. \nStress Testing.\n Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, in October 2012, the Federal Reserve Board published its final rules regarding company-run stress testing. The rules require institutions with average total consolidated assets greater than $10 billion, such as the Company and our bank subsidiary, to conduct an annual company-run stress test of capital and consolidated earnings and losses under one base and at least two stress scenarios provided by bank regulatory agencies. \n17\nTable of \nContents\nOn May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cEGRRCPA\u201d) was signed into law, making certain limited amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as certain targeted modifications to other post-financial crisis regulations. Among other things, the law raises the asset thresholds for Dodd-Frank Act company-run stress testing, liquidity coverage and living will requirements for bank holding companies to $250 billion, subject to the ability of the Fed to apply such requirements to institutions with assets of $100 billion or more to address financial stability risks or safety and soundness concerns. On July 6, 2018, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the \u201cOCC\u201d) issued a joint interagency statement regarding the impact of the EGRRCPA. As a result of this statement and the EGRRCPA, we and our bank subsidiary are no longer subject to Dodd-Frank Act stress testing requirements and were not required to undergo stress testing in 2019. Notwithstanding these amendments to the stress testing requirements, the federal banking agencies indicated through interagency guidance that the capital planning and risk management practices of institutions with total assets less than $100 billion would continue to be reviewed through the regular supervisory process. We will continue to monitor our capital consistent with the safety and soundness expectations of the federal regulators.\nRisk Management\n. Regulation YY requires publicly-traded bank holding companies with $10 billion or more in total assets to establish a risk committee responsible for oversight of enterprise-wide risk management practices. The committee must be chaired by an independent director and include at least one risk management expert with experience in managing risk exposures of large, complex firms. As a result of our total assets exceeding $10 billion, we established a risk committee meeting these requirements. However, effective May 2018, the recently enacted EGRRCPA increased the asset threshold for mandatory risk committees from $10 billion to $50 billion in total assets. While we are no longer required to maintain a risk committee, we currently continue to utilize our risk committee to oversee our enterprise-wide risk management practices.\nRegulation YY also requires us, as a publicly-traded bank holding company with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets, to have a global risk management framework commensurate with their structure, risk profile, complexity, activities, and size. The risk management framework must include risk management policies and procedures, as well as processes and controls to implement them. Accordingly, we have adopted a compliant risk management framework.\nPayment of Dividends\n. We are a legal entity separate and distinct from our bank subsidiary and other affiliated entities. The principal sources of our cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to our shareholders, are dividends that our bank subsidiary pays to us as its sole shareholder. Statutory and regulatory limitations apply to the dividends that our bank subsidiary can pay to us, as well as to the dividends we can pay to our shareholders.\nThe policy of the Federal Reserve Board that a bank holding company should serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary bank also results in the position of the Federal Reserve Board that a bank holding company should not maintain a level of cash dividends to its shareholders that places undue pressure on the capital of its bank subsidiary or that can be funded only through additional borrowings or other arrangements that may undermine the bank holding company\u2019s ability to serve as such a source of strength. Our ability to pay dividends is also subject to the provisions of Arkansas law. \nThere are certain state-law limitations on the payment of dividends by our bank subsidiary. Centennial Bank, which is subject to Arkansas banking laws, may not declare or pay a dividend of 75% or more of the net profits of such bank after all taxes for the current year plus 75% of the retained net profits for the immediately preceding year without the prior approval of the Arkansas State Bank Commissioner (the \u201cBank Commissioner\u201d). Members of the Federal Reserve System must also comply with the dividend restrictions with which a national bank would be required to comply. Among other things, these restrictions require that if losses have at any time been sustained by a bank equal to or exceeding its undivided profits then on hand, no dividend may be paid. Although we have historically paid quarterly dividends on our common stock, there can be no assurances that we will be able to pay dividends in the future under the applicable regulatory limitations.\nThe payment of dividends by us, or by our bank subsidiary, may also be affected by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution\u2019s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under FDICIA, a depository institution may not pay any dividend if payment would result in the depository institution being undercapitalized.\n18\nTable of \nContents\nSubsidiary Bank\nGeneral. \nOur bank subsidiary, Centennial Bank, is chartered as an Arkansas state bank and is a member of the Federal Reserve System, making it primarily subject to regulation and supervision by both the Federal Reserve Board and the Arkansas State Bank Department. In addition, our bank subsidiary is subject to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state law, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be granted and the interest that they may charge, and limitations on the types of investments they may make and on the types of services they may offer. Various consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of our bank subsidiary. Further, because our bank subsidiary had total assets of over $10 billion as of December\u00a031, 2021, it is subject to supervision and regulation by the CFPB, which is responsible for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer protection laws.\nPrompt Corrective Action. \nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 establishes a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized financial institutions. Under this system, the federal banking regulators have established five capital categories (well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized) in which all institutions are placed. Federal banking regulators are required to take various mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. The federal banking agencies have specified by regulation the relevant capital level for each category.\nAn institution that is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking agency. An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions, establishing any branches or engaging in any new line of business, except under an accepted capital restoration plan or with FDIC approval. The regulations also establish procedures for downgrading an institution to a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital.\nThe Basel III final rule issued by the federal bank regulatory agencies in July 2013 amended the prompt corrective action rules to incorporate a common equity Tier 1 capital requirement and to raise the capital requirements for certain capital categories. These rules became effective as of January 1, 2015. In order to be adequately capitalized for purposes of the prompt corrective action rules, a banking organization is required to have at least an 8% total risk-based capital ratio, a 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, a 4.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a 4% Tier 1 leverage ratio. To be well-capitalized, a banking organization is required to have at least a 10% total risk-based capital ratio, an 8% Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, a 6.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a 5% Tier 1 leverage ratio.\nDeposit Insurance and Assessments\n. Centennial Bank\u2019s deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC\u2019s Deposit Insurance Fund (\u201cDIF\u201d). The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the deposit coverage limit to $250,000 per depositor retroactive to January 1, 2008. \nThe FDIC imposes an assessment against institutions for deposit insurance. This assessment is based primarily on the risk category of the institution and certain risk adjustments specified by the FDIC, with riskier institutions paying higher assessments. Under the FDIC\u2019s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions with at least $10 billion in assets are assessed on the basis of a scoring system that combines the institution\u2019s regulatory ratings and certain financial measures. The scoring system assesses risk measures to produce two scores, a performance score and a loss severity score, that will be combined and converted to an initial assessment rate. The performance score measures an institution\u2019s financial performance and its ability to withstand stress. The loss severity score quantifies the relative magnitude of potential losses to the FDIC in the event of an institution\u2019s failure. Once the performance and loss severity scores are calculated, these scores will be converted to a total score. The FDIC has the authority to raise or lower assessment rates, subject to limits, and to impose special additional assessments. \n19\nTable of \nContents\nIn 2011, the FDIC approved a final rule implementing changes to the deposit insurance assessment system, as authorized by the Dodd-Frank Act, which, among other things, changed the assessment base for insured depository institutions from adjusted domestic deposits to the institution\u2019s average consolidated total assets during an assessment period less average tangible equity capital (Tier 1 capital) during that period. The rule revised the assessment rate schedule so that it ranges from 2.5 basis points for the least risky institutions to 45 basis points for the riskiest institutions. The rule also suspended indefinitely the requirement of the FDIC to pay dividends from the DIF when it reaches 1.5% of insured deposits. In lieu of the dividends, the FDIC adopted progressively lower assessment rate schedules when the reserve ratio exceeds 1.15%, 2.0% and 2.5%, respectively. The designated reserve ratio (\u201cDRR\u201d) exceeded 1.15% as of June 30, 2016. As a result, the base deposit insurance rates now range from (i) 1.5 to 30 basis points of an institution\u2019s assessment base for small banks and (ii) 1.5 to 40 basis points for institutions with an assessment base of over $10 billion. \nThe FDIC has historically imposed special additional assessments on depository institutions from time to time in order to bolster deposit insurance funds. Starting the quarter after the DRR surpassed 1.15% in 2016 and ending October 1, 2018, when the DRR reached 1.35%, insured institutions with an assessment base (total assets less tangible capital) of over $10 billion were required to pay surcharge insurance assessments at an annual rate of 4.5 basis points of their assessment base. In addition, for many years, all institutions with deposits insured by the FDIC were required to pay quarterly assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, a mixed-ownership government corporation established as a financing vehicle to recapitalize the former Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corporation. The final series of these bonds matured in September 2019, and the final assessment was collected in the first quarter of 2019. \nUnder the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act\n. The Community Reinvestment Act requires, in connection with examinations of financial institutions, that federal banking regulators evaluate the record of each financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local community, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. These facts are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility. Failure to adequately meet these criteria could impose additional requirements and limitations on our bank subsidiary. Additionally, we must publicly disclose the terms of various Community Reinvestment Act-related agreements. Our bank subsidiary received a \u201csatisfactory\u201d CRA rating from the Federal Reserve Bank during its last exam as published in our bank\u2019s CRA Public Evaluation.\nCapital Requirements. \nOur bank subsidiary is also subject to certain restrictions on the payment of dividends as a result of the requirement that it maintain adequate levels of capital in accordance with guidelines promulgated from time to time by applicable regulators. The regulating agencies consider a bank\u2019s capital levels when taking action on various types of applications and when conducting supervisory activities related to the safety and soundness of individual banks and the banking system. The Federal Reserve Bank monitors the capital adequacy of our bank subsidiary by using a combination of risk-based guidelines and leverage ratios.\nThe FDIC Improvement Act. \nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, or \u201cFDICIA,\u201d made a number of reforms addressing the safety and soundness of the deposit insurance system, supervision of domestic and foreign depository institutions, and improvement of accounting standards. This statute also limited deposit insurance coverage, implemented changes in consumer protection laws and provided for least-cost resolution and prompt regulatory action with regard to troubled institutions.\nFDICIA requires every bank with total assets in excess of $500 million to have an annual independent audit made of the bank\u2019s financial statements by an independent public accountant to verify that the financial statements of the bank are presented fairly and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and comply with such other disclosure requirements as prescribed by the FDIC. FDICIA also places certain restrictions on activities of banks depending on their level of capital.\nThe capital classification of a bank affects the frequency of examinations of the bank and impacts the ability of the bank to engage in certain activities and affects the deposit insurance premiums paid by such bank. Under FDICIA, the federal banking regulators are required to conduct a full-scope, on-site examination of every bank at least once every 12 months. \n20\nTable of \nContents\nBrokered Deposits. \nUnder FDICIA, banks may be restricted in their ability to accept brokered deposits, depending on their capital classification. \u201cWell-capitalized\u201d banks are permitted to accept brokered deposits, but banks that are not well-capitalized are not permitted to accept such deposits. The FDIC may, on a case-by-case basis, permit banks that are adequately capitalized to accept brokered deposits if the FDIC determines that acceptance of such deposits would not constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice with respect to the bank. The EGRRCPA enacted in May 2018 provides that most reciprocal deposits are no longer treated as brokered deposits.\nFederal Home Loan Bank System. \nThe Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d) system, of which our bank subsidiary is a member, consists of regional FHLBs governed and regulated by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or FHFA. The FHLBs serve as reserve or credit facilities for member institutions within their assigned regions. They are funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. They make loans (i.e., advances) to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the FHLB and the boards of directors of each regional FHLB.\nAs a system member, our bank subsidiary is entitled to borrow from the FHLB of its region and is required to own a certain amount of capital stock in the FHLB. Our bank subsidiary is in compliance with the stock ownership rules with respect to such advances, commitments and letters of credit and home mortgage loans and similar obligations. All loans, advances and other extensions of credit made by the FHLB to our bank subsidiary are secured by a portion of its respective loan portfolio, certain other investments and the capital stock of the FHLB held by such bank.\nFederal Reserve System.\n \nIn January 2019, the Federal Open Market Committee announced its intention to implement monetary policy in an ample reserves regime. Reserve requirements do not play a significant role in this operating framework. In light of the shift to an ample reserves regime, the Federal Reserve reduced the reserve requirement ratios to zero percent effective on March 26, 2020. As a result, the Bank is no longer required to maintain required reserve balance with either the FRB or in the form of cash on hand.\nConcentrated Commercial Real Estate Lending Regulations.\n The federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have promulgated guidance governing financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending, which was re-emphasized in December 2015. The guidance provides that a bank has a concentration in commercial real estate lending if (1) total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100% or more of total capital or (2) total reported loans secured by multifamily and non-farm residential properties and loans for construction, land development and other land represent 300% or more of total capital and the bank\u2019s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months. Owner occupied loans are excluded from this second category. If a concentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices that address the following key elements: including board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending.\nMortgage Banking Operations\n. Our bank subsidiary is subject to the rules and regulations of FHA, VA, FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA with respect to originating, processing, selling and servicing mortgage loans and the issuance and sale of mortgage-backed securities. Those rules and regulations, among other things, prohibit discrimination and establish underwriting guidelines which include provisions for inspections and appraisals, require credit reports on prospective borrowers and fix maximum loan amounts, and, with respect to VA loans, fix maximum interest rates. \n21\nTable of \nContents\nConsumer Financial Protection.\n Our bank subsidiary is subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern its relationship with its customers. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act and these laws\u2019 respective state-law counterparts, as well as state usury laws and laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices. These and other federal laws, among other things, require disclosures of the cost of credit and terms of deposit accounts, provide substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, provide financial privacy protections, prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive practices, restrict the bank\u2019s ability to raise interest rates and subject the bank to substantial regulatory oversight. Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorneys\u2019 fees. Federal bank regulators, state attorneys general and state and local consumer protection agencies may also seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies, including regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, action by the state and local attorneys general in each jurisdiction in which our bank subsidiary operates and civil money penalties. Failure to comply with consumer protection requirements may also result in our bank subsidiary\u2019s failure to obtain any required bank regulatory approval for merger or acquisition transactions the bank may wish to pursue or its prohibition from engaging in such transactions even if approval is not required.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, which has supervisory authority over depository institutions with total assets of $10 billion or greater. The CFPB focuses its supervision and regulatory efforts on (1) risks to consumers and compliance with the federal consumer financial laws when it evaluates the policies and practices of a financial institution; (2) the markets in which firms operate and risks to consumers posed by activities in those markets; (3) depository institutions that offer a wide variety of consumer financial products and services; (4) certain depository institutions with a more specialized focus; and (5) non-depository companies that offer one or more consumer financial products or services.\nThe CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks, including, among other things, the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts and practices. Abusive acts or practices are defined as those that materially interfere with a consumer\u2019s ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service or take unreasonable advantage of a consumer\u2019s (1) lack of financial savvy, (2) inability to protect himself in the selection or use of consumer financial products or services or (3) reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in the consumer\u2019s interests. The CFPB can issue cease-and-desist orders against banks and other entities that violate consumer financial laws. The CFPB may also institute a civil action against an entity in violation of federal consumer financial law in order to impose a civil penalty or injunction. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets, as well as their affiliates.\nLoans to One Borrower. \nOur bank subsidiary generally may not make loans or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be loaned, up to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate. As of December\u00a031, 2021, our bank subsidiary was in compliance with the loans-to-one-borrower limitations.\nProhibitions Against Tying Arrangements.\n Under Regulation Y, our bank holding company and bank subsidiary are prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.\nChange in Control\n. Federal and state laws, including the Change in Bank Control Act, impose prior notice or approval requirements and ongoing regulatory requirements on any investor that seeks to acquire direct or indirect \u201ccontrol\u201d of an FDIC-insured depository institution or bank holding company. \u201cControl\u201d of a depository institution is generally defined where an investor is deemed to control a depository institution or other company if the investor owns or controls 25% or more of any class of voting securities. \nRestrictions on Transactions with Affiliates. \nWe and our bank subsidiary are subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. In general, Section 23A imposes limits on the amount of transactions between the bank and its affiliates and requires certain levels of collateral for loans to affiliated parties. It also limits the amount of advances to affiliates which are collateralized by the securities or obligations of the bank or its nonbanking affiliates. An affiliate of a bank is generally any company or entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the bank.\n22\nTable of \nContents\nAffiliate transactions are also subject to Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act which generally requires that certain other transactions between the bank and its affiliates be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those prevailing at that time for comparable transactions with or involving other non-affiliated persons.\nSections 22(g) and (h) of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulation, Regulation O, also place restrictions on loans by a bank to executive officers, directors, and principal shareholders. Under Section 22(h), loans to a director, an executive officer and to a greater than 10% shareholder of a bank and certain of their related interests, or insiders, and insiders of affiliates, may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and related interests, the bank\u2019s loans-to-one-borrower limit. Section 22(h) also requires that loans to insiders and to insiders of affiliates be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons, unless the loans are made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that (i) is widely available to employees of the bank and (ii) does not give preference to insiders over other employees of the bank. In addition, Section 22(h) requires prior board of director\u2019s approval for certain loans, and the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by a bank to all insiders cannot exceed the institution\u2019s unimpaired capital and surplus. Furthermore, Section 22(g) places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers.\nInterchange Fees.\n Under the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve Board adopted rules establishing standards for assessing whether the interchange fees that may be charged with respect to certain electronic debit transactions are \u201creasonable and proportional\u201d to the costs incurred by issuers for processing such transactions. Interchange fees, or \u201cswipe\u201d fees, are charges that merchants pay to our bank subsidiary and other card-issuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions. Federal Reserve Board rules applicable to financial institutions that have assets of $10 billion or more provide that the maximum permissible interchange fee is equal to no more than 21 cents plus 5 basis points of the transaction value for many types of debit interchange transactions. A debit card issuer may also recover 1 cent per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraud-related requirements required by the Federal Reserve. In addition, the Federal Reserve has rules governing routing and exclusivity that require issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product. We exceeded $10 billion in assets during the first quarter of 2017 and became subject to the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act interchange fee restrictions beginning in the third quarter of 2018. \nThe Volcker Rule. \nThe Dodd-Frank Act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds. The statutory provision is commonly called the \u201cVolcker Rule.\u201d In December 2013, federal regulators adopted final rules to implement the Volcker Rule that generally became effective in July 2015. The Volcker Rule also requires covered banking entities, including us and our bank subsidiary, to implement certain compliance programs, and the complexity and rigor of such programs is determined based on the asset size and complexity of the business of the covered company. Since neither we nor our bank subsidiary engages in the types of trading or investing covered by the Volcker Rule, the Volcker Rule does not currently have any effect on our or our bank subsidiary\u2019s operations. \nPrivacy.\n Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting confidential information. Customers generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing nonpublic personal financial information with nonaffiliated third parties except under narrow circumstances, such as the processing of transactions requested by the consumer or when the financial institution is jointly sponsoring a product or service with a nonaffiliated third party. Additionally, financial institutions generally may not disclose consumer account numbers to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing or other marketing to consumers. We and our subsidiary have established policies and procedures to assure our compliance with all privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\nWe are also subject to various regulatory guidance as updated from time to time and implemented by the Federal Financial Institutions Examinations Council (the \u201cFFIEC\u201d), an interagency body of the FDIC, the OCC, the Federal Reserve, the National Credit Union Administration and various state regulatory authorities. The FFIEC has provided guidance in areas such as data privacy, disaster recovery, information security, and third-party vendor management to identify potential risks related to our services that could adversely affect our customers. In addition, lawmakers, regulators and the public are increasingly focused on the use of personal information and efforts to strengthen data protection, information security and consumer and personal privacy. The law in these areas continues to develop, and we expect regulation in these areas to continue to increase.\n23\nTable of \nContents\nAnti-Terrorism and Anti-Money Laundering Legislation.\n Our bank subsidiary is subject to the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the \u201cUSA PATRIOT Act\u201d), the Bank Secrecy Act (\u201cBSA\u201d) and rules and regulations of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (the \u201cOFAC\u201d). These statutes and related rules and regulations impose requirements and limitations on specific financial transactions and account relationships intended to guard against money laundering, terrorism financing and transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others on whom the United States has imposed economic sanctions. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required.\nAs part of our bank subsidiary\u2019s anti-money laundering (\u201cAML\u201d) program, we are required to designate a BSA officer, maintain a BSA/AML training program, maintain internal controls to effectuate the BSA/AML program, implement independent testing of the BSA/AML program, and as of February 1, 2019, comply with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network\u2019s new \u201cCustomer Due Diligence for Financial Institutions Rule\u201d (the \u201cCDD Rule\u201d). The CDD Rule adds a new requirement for our bank subsidiary to identify and verify the identity of natural persons (\u201cbeneficial owners\u201d) of legal entity customers who own, control and profit from companies when those companies open accounts. The CDD Rule requires covered financial institutions to establish and maintain written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to (1) identify and verify the identity of customers; (2) identify and verify the identity of the beneficial owners of companies opening accounts; (3) understand the nature and purpose of customer relationships to develop customer risk profiles; and (4) conduct ongoing monitoring to identify and report suspicious transactions and, on a risk basis, to maintain and update customer information. With respect to the new requirement to obtain beneficial ownership information, financial institutions will have to identify and verify the identity of any individuals who own 25 percent or more of a legal entity, and an individual who controls the legal entity.\nIncentive Compensation.\n The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal bank regulators and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. In addition, these regulators must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentive-based compensation arrangements. \nIn June 2010, the Federal Reserve and FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization\u2019s incentive compensation arrangements should (1) provide incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk, (2) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and (3) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization\u2019s board of directors. \nIn May 2016, the Federal Reserve, other federal banking agencies and the SEC jointly published a revised version of proposed rulemaking initially issued in April 2011 designed to implement the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act prohibiting incentive compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking at a covered institution, which includes a bank or bank holding company with $1 billion or more of assets, such as the Company and our bank subsidiary. The proposed joint compensation regulations would require compensation practices consistent with the three principles discussed above. As of February 1, 2022, these regulations have not been finalized. Unless and until a final rule is adopted, we cannot fully determine whether compliance with such a rule will adversely affect the Company\u2019s or our bank subsidiary\u2019s ability to hire, retain and motivate our key employees.\nThe Federal Reserve Board reviews, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not \u201clarge, complex banking organizations.\u201d These reviews are tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization\u2019s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of this supervisory initiative will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization\u2019s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization\u2019s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization\u2019s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.\n24\nTable of \nContents\nCustomer Information Security. \nThe federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines for safeguarding confidential, personal, nonpublic customer information. These guidelines require each financial institution, under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its board of directors or an appropriate committee thereof, to create, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazard to the security or integrity of such information and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. Our bank subsidiary has adopted a customer information security program to comply with these requirements.\nArkansas Law.\n Our bank subsidiary is subject to regulation and examination by the Arkansas State Bank Department. Under the Arkansas Banking Code of 1997, approval of the Bank Commissioner is required for the acquisition of more than 25% of any class of the outstanding capital stock of any bank. The Bank Commissioner\u2019s approval is also required in order for us to make bank acquisitions, amend our articles of incorporation, repurchase shares of our capital stock (other than payments to dissenting shareholders in a transaction), issue preferred stock or debt, increase, reduce or retire any part of our capital stock, retire debt instruments, or conduct certain types of activities that are incidental or closely related to banking. The Bank Commissioner has the authority, with the consent of the Governor of the State of Arkansas, to declare a state of emergency and temporarily modify or suspend banking laws and regulations in communities where such a state of emergency exists. The Bank Commissioner may also authorize a bank to close its offices and any day when such bank offices are closed will be treated as a legal holiday, and any director, officer or employee of such bank shall not incur any liability related to such emergency closing. No such state of emergency has been declared to exist by the Bank Commissioner to date.\nRegulatory Developments Relating to the CARES Act\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) was signed into law on March 27, 2020 to provide national emergency economic relief measures. Many of the CARES Act\u2019s programs are, and remain, dependent upon the direct involvement of U.S. financial institutions like we and our bank subsidiary. These programs have been implemented through rules and guidance adopted by federal departments and agencies, including the U.S. Department of Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and other federal bank regulatory authorities, including those with direct supervisory jurisdiction over the Company and its bank subsidiary. Set forth below is a brief overview of select provisions of the CARES Act and other regulations and supervisory guidance related to the COVID-19 pandemic that are applicable to the operations and activities of the Company and its bank subsidiary.\nPaycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d)\n. The CARES Act established a new federal economic relief program administered by the Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) called the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d), which provides for 100% federally guaranteed loans to be issued by participating private financial institutions to small businesses for payroll and certain other permitted expenses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our bank subsidiary has participated in the PPP as a lender. These loans are eligible to be forgiven if certain conditions are satisfied and are fully guaranteed by the SBA. Additionally, loan payments will also be deferred for the first six months of the loan term. The PPP commenced on April 3, 2020 and was available to qualified borrowers through August 8, 2020. No collateral or personal guarantees were required. Neither the government nor lenders are permitted to charge the recipients any fees. The Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (\u201cPPP/HCEA Act\u201d) was passed by Congress on April 23, 2020 and signed into law on April 24, 2020. The PPP/HCEA Act authorizes additional funds under the CARES Act for PPP loans to be issued by financial institutions through the SBA. On December 27, 2020, the President signed into law omnibus federal spending and economic stimulus legislation titled the Consolidated Appropriations Act that included the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act (the \u201cHHSB Act\u201d). Among other things, the HHSB Act renewed the PPP, allocating $284.45 billion for both new first time PPP loans under the existing PPP and the expansion of existing PPP loans for certain qualified, existing PPP borrowers. We continue to monitor legislative, regulatory, and supervisory developments related thereto, including the most recent changes implemented by the HHSB Act.\n25\nTable of \nContents\nTroubled Debt Restructuring and Loan Modifications for Affected Borrowers\n. \nSection 4013 of the CARES Act provides financial institutions the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) related to troubled debt restructurings (\u201cTDR\u201d) for a limited period of time to account for the effects of COVID-19. Such suspension may be made if: (i) the loan modification is made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of December 31, 2020 or 60 days after the national COVID-19 emergency termination date, (ii) the applicable loan was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019, and (iii) the suspension applies to adverse impact on the credit of a borrower that is related to COVID-19. Section 541 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act extends this relief to the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days after the national COVID-19 emergency termination date. Additionally, on March 22, 2020, certain banking regulators and other agencies issued a statement titled the \u201cInteragency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus\u201d (the \u201cInteragency Statement\u201d), which encourages financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations due to the effects of COVID-19. The Interagency Statement was subsequently revised in April 2020 to clarify the interaction of the original guidance with Section 4013 of the CARES Act, as well as setting forth the banking regulators\u2019 views on consumer protection considerations. Consistent with the Interagency Statement and to support our customers, we have deferred loan payments for certain consumer and commercial customers, and have offered fee waivers, payment deferrals, and other expanded assistance for automobile, mortgage, small business and personal lending customers. The Company has relied on Section 4013 of the CARES Act in accounting for loan modifications since the fourth quarter of 2020. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had 26 remaining loan modifications for a total of $190.7\u00a0million.  All of the customers currently on deferment chose principal deferment only and now have returned to paying interest monthly.\n \nTemporary Regulatory Capital Relief related to Impact of Current Expected Credit Loss (\u201cCECL\u201d). \nConcurrent with enactment of the CARES Act, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that delays the estimated impact on regulatory capital resulting from the implementation of CECL. The interim final rule maintains the three-year transition option in the previous rule and provides banking organizations that implemented CECL during 2020 the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology\u2019s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay. We adopted CECL on January 1, 2020 and have elected to utilize the five-year transition option.\nProposed Legislation and Regulatory Action\nFrom time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment for us and our bank subsidiary in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. We cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed regulation or statute will be adopted or the extent to which our business may be affected by any new regulation or statute. \nEffect of Governmental Monetary Polices\nOur earnings are affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. The Federal Reserve Board\u2019s monetary policies have had, and are likely to continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of commercial banks through its power to implement national monetary policy in order, among other things, to curb inflation or combat a recession. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board affect the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through its control over the issuance of United States government securities, its regulation of the discount rate applicable to banks and its influence over reserve requirements to which banks are subject. We cannot predict the nature or impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nWe are subject to the information requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, we file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. In addition, we maintain a website at http://www.homebancshares.com.

RISK FACTORS\nOur business exposes us to certain risks. Risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on may also adversely affect our business and operation. The following is a discussion of the most significant risks and uncertainties that may affect our business, financial condition and future results.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities and impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business, and changes in the laws and regulations to which we are subject could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe and our bank subsidiary are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. As a registered bank holding company, we are primarily regulated by the Federal Reserve Board. Our bank subsidiary is also primarily regulated by the Federal Reserve Board and the Arkansas State Bank Department.\nBanking industry regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not security holders. Complying with such regulations is costly and may limit our growth and restrict certain of our activities, including payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged, interest rates paid on deposits and locations of offices. We are also subject to capital requirements by our regulators. Violations of various laws, even if unintentional, may result in significant fines or other penalties, including restrictions on branching or bank acquisitions.\nCongress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. The Dodd-Frank Act, passed by Congress in 2010, instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes in light of the performance of and government intervention in the financial services sector during the economic recession leading up to its enactment. The act required the issuance of a substantial number of new regulations by federal regulatory agencies affecting financial institutions, some of which still have yet to be issued or implemented.\nWhile the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act enacted in 2018 reduced certain regulatory burdens on community and regional financial institutions resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act, we cannot assure that future legislation will not significantly increase our compliance or operating costs or otherwise have a significant impact on our business. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations promulgated under the act may continue to be implemented, and there could be additional new federal or state laws, regulations and policies regarding lending and funding practices and liquidity standards. Additionally, financial institution regulatory agencies have intensified their response to concerns and trends identified in examinations, including through the issuance of formal enforcement actions. Negative developments in the financial services industry or other new legislation or regulations could adversely impact our operations and our financial performance by subjecting us to additional costs, restricting our business operations, including our ability to originate or sell loans, and/or increasing the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services.\nAs regulation of the banking industry continues to evolve, we expect the costs of compliance to continue to increase and, thus, to affect our ability to operate profitably. In addition, industry, legislative or regulatory developments may cause us to materially change our existing strategic direction, capital strategies, compensation or operating plans. If these developments negatively impact our ability to implement our business strategies, it may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and future prospects.\nWe are subject to heightened regulatory requirements as our total assets exceed $10 billion.\nBecause our total assets exceed $10 billion, we and our bank subsidiary are subject to increased regulatory requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations impose various additional requirements on bank holding companies with $10 billion or more in total assets. In addition, banks with $10 billion or more in total assets are primarily examined by the CFPB with respect to various federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations. Previously, our bank subsidiary had been subject to regulations adopted by the CFPB, but the Federal Reserve was primarily responsible for examining our bank subsidiary\u2019s compliance with consumer protection laws and those CFPB regulations. As a relatively new agency with evolving regulations and practices, the CFPB\u2019s examination and regulatory authority has been and continues to be the subject of policy debates and uncertainty among lawmakers and differing presidential administrations, and thus we cannot ascertain the impact, if any, that future changes to the CFPB may have on our business.\n27\nTable of \nContents\nBanks with assets in excess of $10 billion are subject to a deposit assessment based on a scorecard issued by the FDIC that considers, among other things, the bank\u2019s CAMELS rating, results of asset-related stress testing and funding-related stress, as well as our use of core deposits, among other things. Depending on the results of the bank\u2019s performance under that scorecard, the total base assessment rate is between 1.5 to 40 basis points. Any increase in our bank subsidiary\u2019s deposit insurance assessments may result in an increased expense related to our use of deposits as a funding source. Additionally, banks with over $10 billion in total assets are no longer exempt from the requirements of the Federal Reserve\u2019s rules on interchange transaction fees for debit cards. Since July 1, 2018, our bank subsidiary has been limited to receiving only a \u201creasonable\u201d interchange transaction fee for any debit card transactions processed using debit cards issued by our bank subsidiary to our customers. The Federal Reserve has determined that it is unreasonable for a bank with more than $10 billion in total assets to receive more than $0.21 plus 5 basis points of the transaction plus a $0.01 fraud adjustment for an interchange transaction fee for debit card transactions. This limit in the amount of interchange fees we receive for electronic debit interchange has the effect of reducing our revenues. \nPrior to becoming subject to the heightened regulatory requirements, we hired additional compliance personnel and implemented structural initiatives to address these requirements. While some of these requirements, such as annual stress testing, were eliminated by the reforms enacted in May 2018, our continued compliance with the remaining requirements and compliance with any additional requirements that may be imposed in the future may necessitate that we hire additional compliance or other personnel, design and implement additional internal controls, or incur other significant expenses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our regulators may also consider our compliance with these regulatory requirements when examining our operations generally or considering any request for regulatory approval we may make, even requests for approvals on unrelated matters.\nDifficult market and economic conditions may adversely affect our industry and our business.\nEconomic downturns historically have had a significant adverse impact on the banking industry, and particularly community banks. Declines in the housing market, with falling home prices and increased delinquencies and foreclosures, can negatively impact the credit performance of mortgage and construction loans and result in significant write-downs of assets by financial institutions. Any reduced availability of commercial credit or periods of sustained higher unemployment can further negatively impact the credit performance of commercial and consumer credit, resulting in additional write-downs. Any such market conditions could cause commercial and consumer deficiencies, low customer confidence, market volatility and generally sluggish business activity in our industry.\nUnlike larger financial institutions that are more geographically diversified, our profitability depends primarily on the general economic conditions in our primary market areas. Local economic conditions have a significant impact on our residential real estate, commercial real estate, construction, commercial and industrial and consumer lending, including, the ability of borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. Certain economic indicators, such as real estate asset values, rents and unemployment, may vary between geographic markets and may lag behind the overall economy. These economic indicators typically affect certain industries, such as real estate and financial services, more significantly than other economic sectors. Additionally, our success significantly depends upon the growth in population, income levels, deposits and housing starts in our markets. If the communities in which we operate do not grow or if prevailing economic conditions deteriorate locally or nationally, our business may be adversely affected. We are less able than a larger institution to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies. The adverse effects of any future economic downturn on us, our customers and the other financial institutions in our market may result in increased foreclosures, delinquencies and customer bankruptcies as well as more restricted access to funds. Any such negative events may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\n28\nTable of \nContents\nThe ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition and results of operations. The ultimate impacts of the pandemic on our business will depend on factors that remain uncertain such as, among other things, the long-term scope and duration of the pandemic, the success of ongoing vaccination, treatment and other mitigation efforts, and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the economic effects of the pandemic.\nSince the first quarter of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted U.S. and global supply chains and altered business and economic conditions throughout the U.S. and globally. Following the initial outbreak of the pandemic, its economic impacts lowered equity market valuations; created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets; contributed to a decrease in the rates and yields on U.S. Treasury securities; resulted in ratings downgrades, credit deterioration, and defaults in many industries; increased demands on capital and liquidity; and increased unemployment levels and decreased consumer confidence. In addition, the pandemic has resulted in temporary or permanent closures of many businesses, the institution of social distancing, face covering requirements and other health directives, and in some cases, self-isolation requirements. The pandemic has caused us, and could cause us in the future, to recognize credit losses in our loan portfolios and increases in our allowance for credit losses and could cause further volatility in the valuation of real estate and other collateral supporting loans. Furthermore, the pandemic could cause us to recognize impairment of our goodwill and our financial assets. Sustained adverse effects could also increase our cost of capital, prevent us from satisfying our minimum regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory requirements, or result in downgrades in our credit ratings. The extent to which the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations will depend on future developments, which remain uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the long-term scope and duration of the pandemic, the success of ongoing vaccination, treatment and other mitigation efforts, any further actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the economic and health effects of the pandemic, and the long-term financial impact of the pandemic on our customers, employees, counterparties and service providers.\nGovernmental authorities in the past two years have taken significant measures to provide economic assistance to individual households and businesses, stabilize the markets, and support economic growth, and it is possible that further such measures will be enacted or implemented. The long-term success of these measures remains uncertain, and they may not be sufficient to fully mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic or could cause unintended adverse economic consequences. Additionally, governmental programs and policies could impact our ability to resolve credit delinquencies as well as create heightened litigation risk and risk of holding loans at unfavorable interest rates. We also face an increased risk of governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of the pandemic on market and economic conditions and actions governmental authorities take in response to those conditions.\nThe potential global and economic impacts of the coronavirus continue to evolve, and the length of the pandemic and the effectiveness of the measures being put in place to address it remain uncertain. Until the effects of the pandemic subside, we could experience reduced revenues in our businesses and increased customer defaults. Furthermore, any future volatility in the economy or prolonged recession could further materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations.\nOur FDIC insurance premiums and assessments could increase and result in higher noninterest expense.\nOur bank subsidiary\u2019s deposits are insured by the FDIC up to legal limits, and accordingly, we are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. As our bank subsidiary exceeds $10 billion in assets, we are subject to higher FDIC assessments. Our bank subsidiary\u2019s regular assessments are calculated under the large bank pricing rule using its average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity as well as by risk classification, which includes regulatory capital levels.\nWe are generally unable to control the amount and timetable for payment of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. There is no guarantee that our assessment rate will not increase in the future. Additionally, if there is an increase in bank or financial institution failures or there is a future need to strengthen the DIF reserve ratio, the FDIC may further revise the assessment rates or the risk-based assessment system. Such changes may require us to pay higher FDIC premiums than our current levels, or the FDIC may charge additional special assessments, either of which would increase our noninterest expense.\n29\nTable of \nContents\nOur profitability is vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations and monetary policy and could be adversely affected by any future actions taken by the Federal Reserve Board to address rising inflation.\nOur results of operations are affected by the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board. Most of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature, and thus subject us to significant risks from changes in interest rates. Consequently, our results of operations can be significantly affected by changes in interest rates and our ability to manage interest rate risk. Changes in market interest rates, or changes in the relationships between short-term and long-term market interest rates, or changes in the relationship between different interest rate indices can affect the interest rates charged on interest-earning assets differently than the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. This difference could result in an increase in interest expense relative to interest income or a decrease in interest rate spread. In addition to affecting our profitability, changes in interest rates can impact the valuation of our assets and liabilities. Changes in interest rates can also affect our business and profitability in numerous other ways. For example, increases in interest rates can have a negative impact on our results of operations by reducing loan demand and the ability of borrowers to repay their current obligations, while decreases in interest rates may affect loan prepayments.\nIn response to rising inflation and its affects on U.S. business and consumers in recent months, it is widely anticipated that the Federal Reserve will implement multiple interest rate increases during 2022. Any such actions by the Federal Reserve Board involving monetary policies could cause any of the adverse effects described above on our deposit levels, loan demand or business and earnings.\nWe may be adversely impacted by the transition from the use of the LIBOR interest rate index in the future.\nWe have certain loans, investment securities and subordinated debt securities indexed to LIBOR to calculate the interest rate. The continued availability of the LIBOR index is not guaranteed after the United Kingdom administrators of LIBOR have announced that the publication of the most commonly used U.S. dollar LIBOR settings will cease to be published after June 2023. We cannot predict, in the interim, whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted. With respect to our loan assets, at this time, there is some industry guidance regarding acceptable alternatives to LIBOR. After review and analysis from the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Alternative Reference Rates Committee, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau published its final rule recommending the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, as a compliant replacement index to LIBOR that would not trigger a refinance under existing regulations for certain consumer loans. Loan contracts may also contain alternate rate language permitting transfer to SOFR, Wall Street Journal Prime or another index when LIBOR is no longer available. The timing and manner in which each customer\u2019s contract transitions to a new index will vary on a case-by-case basis. There continues to be some uncertainty related to the LIBOR transition. New index rates and payments will differ from LIBOR, which may lead to increased volatility. The transition has impacted our market risk profiles and required changes to our risk and pricing models, valuation tools, and product design. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact our reputation. With respect to investment securities and subordinated debt securities, we expect similar transition issues. Failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n30\nTable of \nContents\nWe have participated as a lender in the Paycheck Protection Program and accordingly are subject to certain risks applicable to lenders under such program.\nThe PPP loans we have made under the federal CARES Act are guaranteed by the SBA. If the loan funds are used by the borrower for specific purposes as provided under the PPP, these loans may be fully or partially forgiven by the SBA, at which time our bank subsidiary will receive funds related to the PPP loan forgiveness directly from the SBA. If the borrower fails to qualify for loan forgiveness, we are at heightened risk of holding these loans at unfavorable interest rates as compared to the loans to customers that we would have otherwise extended credit. Because of the brief time between the passing of the CARES Act and implementation of the PPP, some of the rules and guidance relating to the PPP evolved or were issued after lenders, including our bank subsidiary, began processing PPP loan applications. There has been uncertainty regarding some of the laws, rules and guidance relating to the PPP. If the SBA or other regulators determine that we have not complied with all PPP laws, rules and guidance, we could be required to refund some or all of the fees related to PPP loans that we have earned or be subject to other regulatory enforcement action. Furthermore, in the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded or serviced by our bank subsidiary, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty or, if it has already made payment under the guaranty, seek recovery from us of any loss related to the deficiency. In addition, since the commencement of the PPP, we and certain other banks have been subject to litigation, which was subsequently dismissed, regarding the processing of PPP loan applications and payment of processing fees to third party agents. We could be exposed to the risk of other litigation from both customers and non-customers who sought PPP loans from us or in connection with other aspects of the PPP, including but not limited to borrowers seeking forgiveness of their loans. Any financial liability, litigation costs, or reputational damage caused by PPP-related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur decisions regarding credit risk could be inaccurate and our allowance for credit losses may be inadequate, which would materially and adversely affect us.\nManagement makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of our secured loans. We endeavor to maintain an allowance for credit losses that we consider adequate to absorb future losses that may occur in our loan portfolio. As of December\u00a031, 2021, our allowance for credit losses was approximately $236.7 million, or 2.41% of our total loans. In determining the size of the allowance, we analyze our loan portfolio based on our historical loss experience, volume and classification of loans, volume and trends in delinquencies and non-accruals, national and local economic conditions, and other pertinent information.\nIf our assumptions are incorrect, our current allowance may be insufficient to absorb future loan losses, and increased loan loss reserves may be needed to respond to different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio. When there is an economic downturn, it is more difficult for us to estimate the losses that we will experience in our loan portfolio. In addition, federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require us to increase our allowance for credit losses or recognize further loan charge-offs based on judgments different than those of our management. Any increase in our allowance for credit losses or loan charge-offs could have a negative effect on our operating results.\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted new accounting rules affecting the calculation of the allowance for credit losses (formerly the allowance for loan losses) known as ASU 2016-13,\n Financial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\n. This guidance replaces the incurred loss methodology for determining the former allowance for loan losses with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) methodology. This standard requires financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for credit losses. In connection with the adoption of this guidance, we recorded a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to the allowance for credit losses of $44.0 million which was recognized through a $32.5 million adjustment to retained earnings, net of tax. This adjustment brought the beginning balance of the allowance for credit losses to $146.1 million as of January 1, 2020. In addition, the Company recorded a $15.5 million reserve on unfunded commitments which was recognized through an $11.5 million adjustment to retained earnings, net of tax. The adoption of the standard has required significant changes to the processes and procedures required to calculate the allowance for credit losses, including changes in assumptions and estimates to consider expected credit losses over the life of the loan versus the current accounting practice that utilizes the incurred loss model. For additional information on the allowance for credit losses, see Notes 1 and 5 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021. \n31\nTable of \nContents\nOur high concentration of real estate loans and especially commercial real estate loans exposes us to increased lending risk.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021,\n \n70.8%\n \nof our total loan portfolio was comprised of loans with real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. This includes commercial real estate loans (excluding construction/land development) of $4.02 billion, or 40.9%\n \nof total loans, construction/land development loans of $1.85 billion, or\n \n18.8%\n \nof total loans, and residential real estate loans of\n \n$1.56 billion, or 15.8%\n \nof total loans\n. \nThis high concentration of real estate loans could subject us to increased credit risk in the event of a decrease in real estate values in our markets, a real estate recession or a natural disaster. Also, in any such event, our ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling real estate collateral would be diminished, and we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans.\nIn addition to the risks associated with the high concentration of real estate-secured loans, the commercial real estate and construction/land development loans, which comprised 59.7% of our total loan portfolio as of December\u00a031, 2021, expose us to a greater risk of loss than our residential real estate loans, which comprised 15.8% of our total loan portfolio as of December\u00a031, 2021. Commercial real estate and land development loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential loans. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one commercial loan or one credit relationship exposes us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to one residential mortgage loan.\nThe repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate or commercial project. If the cash flows from the project are reduced, a borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. This cash flow shortage may result in the failure to make loan payments. In such cases, we may be compelled to modify the terms of the loan, or in the most extreme cases, we may have to foreclose.\nIf a decline in economic conditions or other issues cause difficulties for our borrowers of these types of loans, if we fail to evaluate the credit of these loans accurately when we underwrite them or if we do not continue to adequately monitor the performance of these loans, our lending portfolio could experience delinquencies, defaults and credit losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur geographic concentration of banking activities and loan portfolio makes us more vulnerable to adverse conditions in our local markets.\nOur bank subsidiary operates through branch locations in Arkansas, Florida, Alabama and New York City and loan production offices in Los Angeles, California, Dallas, Texas, Miami, Florida, Chesapeake, Virginia and Baltimore, Maryland. However, approximately 70.8% of our total loans and 74.6% of our real estate loans as of December\u00a031, 2021, are to borrowers whose collateral is located in Arkansas, Florida, Alabama and New York, the states in which the Company has its branch locations. An adverse development with respect to the market conditions of any of these specific market areas or a decrease in real estate values in those market areas could expose us to a greater risk of loss than a portfolio that is spread among a larger geographic base.\nIf the value of real estate were to deteriorate, a significant portion of our loans could become under-collateralized, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, approximately 75.5% of our total loans were secured by real estate. In prior years, difficult local economic conditions have adversely affected the values of our real estate collateral, and they could do so again if the economic conditions markets were to deteriorate in the future. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment on our loans in the event of default by the borrower but may deteriorate in value during the time credit is extended. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, our earnings and capital could be adversely affected.\nBecause we have a concentration of exposure to a number of individual borrowers, a significant loss on any of those loans could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe have a concentration of exposure to a number of individual borrowers. Under applicable law, our bank subsidiary is generally permitted to make loans to one borrowing relationship up to 20% of its Tier 1 capital plus the allowance for credit losses. As of December\u00a031, 2021, the legal lending limit of our bank subsidiary for secured loans was approximately $419.2 million. Our board of directors has established an in-house lending limit of $20.0 million to any one borrowing relationship without obtaining the approval of both our Chairman, John W. Allison, and our director Richard H. Ashley. As of December\u00a031, 2021, we had a total of $5.65 billion, or 57.5% of our total loans, committed to the aggregate group of borrowers whose total debt exceeds the established in-house lending limit of $20.0 million.\n32\nTable of \nContents\nOur cost of funds may increase as a result of general economic conditions, interest rates and competitive pressures.\nOur cost of funds may increase as a result of general economic conditions, interest rates and competitive pressures. We have traditionally obtained funds principally through local deposits, and we have a base of lower cost transaction deposits. Generally, we believe local deposits are a more stable source of funds than other borrowings because interest rates paid for local deposits are typically lower than interest rates charged for borrowings from other institutional lenders. In addition, local deposits reflect a mix of transaction and time deposits, whereas brokered deposits typically are less stable time deposits, which may need to be replaced with higher cost funds. Our costs of funds and our profitability and liquidity are likely to be adversely affected if and to the extent we must rely upon higher cost borrowings from other institutional lenders or brokers to fund loan demand or liquidity needs, and changes in our deposit mix and growth could adversely affect our profitability and the ability to expand our loan portfolio.\nThe loss of key employees may materially and adversely affect us.\nOur success depends significantly on our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, John W. Allison, and our executive officers, especially Brian S. Davis, J. Stephen Tipton and Kevin D. Hester plus Centennial Bank Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, Tracy M. French, as well as other key Centennial Bank personnel. Centennial Bank, in particular, relies heavily on its management team\u2019s relationships in its local communities to generate business. The loss of services from a member of our current management team may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nThe value of securities in our investment portfolio may decline in the future.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, we owned $3.12 billion of investment securities. The fair value of our investment securities may be adversely affected by market conditions, including changes in interest rates, and the occurrence of any events adversely affecting the issuer of particular securities in our investments portfolio. We evaluate all securities quarterly to determine if any securities in a loss position requires a provision for credit losses in accordance with ASC 326, \nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\n. The Company first assesses whether it intends to sell or is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security\u2019s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For securities that do not meet these criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, and changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers, we may be required to record provisions for credit losses in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur recent results do not indicate our future results and may not provide guidance to assess the risk of an investment in our common stock.\nWe are unlikely to sustain our historical rate of growth and may not even be able to expand our business at all. Further, our growth in prior years may distort some of our historical financial ratios and statistics. Various factors, such as economic conditions, regulatory and legislative considerations and competition, may also impede or prohibit our ability to expand our market presence. If we are not able to successfully grow our business, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n33\nTable of \nContents\nWe may not be able to raise the additional capital we need to grow and, as a result, our ability to expand our operations could be materially impaired.\nFederal and state regulatory authorities require us and our bank subsidiary to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. While we believe that our existing capital (which well exceeds the federal and state capital requirements) will be sufficient to support our current operations, anticipated expansion and potential acquisitions, factors such as faster than anticipated growth, reduced earnings levels, operating losses, changes in economic conditions, revisions in regulatory requirements, or additional acquisition opportunities may lead us to seek additional capital.\nOur ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on our financial performance and on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control. If we need additional capital but cannot raise it on terms acceptable to us, our ability to expand our operations could be materially impaired, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected, and our stock price may decline.\nOur growth and expansion strategy may not be successful, and our market value and profitability may suffer.\nGrowth through the acquisition of banks or specific bank assets or liabilities, including FDIC-assisted transactions, and de novo branching represent important components of our business strategy. Bank acquisitions are subject to regulatory approval, and we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain approval for a proposed acquisition in a timely manner or at all. Any future acquisitions we might make will also be accompanied by other risks commonly encountered in acquisitions. These risks include, among other things:\n\u2022\ncredit risk associated with the acquired bank\u2019s loans and investments;\n\u2022\nthe use of inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution or assets;\n\u2022\nthe potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities related to the acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe time and expense required to integrate an acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of integrating operations, personnel and customers;\n\u2022\nrisks of impairment to goodwill or other than temporary impairment; and\n\u2022\npotential disruption of our ongoing business.\nWe expect that competition for suitable acquisition candidates may be significant. We may compete with other banks or financial service companies with similar acquisition strategies, many of which are larger and have greater financial and other resources. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify and acquire suitable acquisition targets on acceptable terms and conditions.\nWe may continue to have opportunities from time to time to acquire the assets and liabilities of failed banks in FDIC-assisted transactions. These acquisitions involve risks similar to acquiring existing banks even though the FDIC might provide assistance to mitigate certain risks such as sharing in exposure to loan losses and providing indemnification against certain liabilities of the failed institution. However, because these acquisitions are structured in a manner that would not allow us the time normally associated with preparing for integration of an acquired institution, we may face additional risks in FDIC-assisted transactions. These risks include, among other things, the loss of customers, strain on management resources related to collection and management of problem loans and problems related to integration of personnel and operating systems.\nIn addition to the acquisition of existing financial institutions or their assets or liabilities, as opportunities arise, we may grow through de novo branching. De novo branching, and any acquisition carry with them numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe inability to obtain all required regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nthe significant upfront costs and anticipated operating losses associated with establishing a de novo branch or a new bank;\n\u2022\nthe inability to secure the services of qualified senior management;\n34\nTable of \nContents\n\u2022\nthe local market receptivity for branches established or banks acquired outside of those markets in which we currently maintain a material presence;\n\u2022\nthe local economic conditions within the market to be served by the de novo branch or new bank;\n\u2022\nthe inability to obtain attractive locations within a new market at a reasonable cost; and\n\u2022\nthe additional strain on management resources and internal systems and controls.\nWe cannot assure that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions (including FDIC-assisted transactions) and de novo branching. Our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business strategy and maintain our market value and profitability.\nIf we acquire additional banks or bank assets in the future, there may be undiscovered risks or losses associated with such acquisitions which would have a negative impact upon our future income.\nOur growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions of banks or bank assets. We have acquired 22 banks since we started our first subsidiary bank in 1999, including a total of 17 banks since 2010. We currently anticipate completing our proposed acquisition of Happy Bancshares, headquartered in Amarillo, Texas, during the first quarter of 2022. We will continue to consider future strategic acquisitions, with a primary focus on Texas, Arkansas, Florida, Alabama and other nearby markets. In most cases, our acquisition of a bank includes the acquisition of all or a substantial portion of the target bank\u2019s assets and liabilities, including all or a substantial portion of its loan portfolio, although we have in the past acquired and may in the future acquire specific lending divisions or loan portfolios. There may be instances when we, under our normal operating procedures, may find after the acquisition that there may be additional losses or undisclosed liabilities with respect to the assets and liabilities of the target bank, and, with respect to its loan portfolio, that the ability of a borrower to repay a loan may have become impaired, the quality of the value of the collateral securing a loan may fall below our standards, or our determination of the fair value of any such loan may be inadequate. One or more of these factors might cause us to have additional losses or liabilities, additional loan charge-offs, or increases in allowances for loan losses, which would have a negative impact upon our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the goodwill that we record in connection with a business acquisition becomes impaired, it could require charges to earnings.\nWhen we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition is generally allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The amount of the purchase price that is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired. At December\u00a031, 2021, our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets were $998.1 million\n.\n Under current accounting standards, if we determine goodwill or intangible assets are impaired because, for example, the acquired business does not meet projected revenue targets or certain key employees leave, we are required to write down the carrying value of these assets. We conduct a review at least annually to determine whether goodwill is impaired. Our annual goodwill impairment evaluation performed during the fourth quarter of 2021 indicated no impairment of goodwill for our reporting segments. We cannot provide assurance, however, that we will not be required to take an impairment charge in the future. Any impairment charge would have an adverse effect on our shareholders\u2019 equity and financial results and could cause a decline in our stock price.\nCompetition from other financial institutions and financial service providers may adversely affect our profitability.\nWe face substantial competition in all phases of our operations from a variety of different competitors. We experience strong competition, not only from commercial banks, savings and loan associations and credit unions, but also from mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds and other financial services providers operating in or near our market areas. We compete with these institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans.\nMany of our competitors are much larger national and regional financial institutions. We may face a competitive disadvantage against them as a result of our smaller size and resources and our lack of geographic diversification. Due to their size, larger competitors can achieve economies of scale and may offer a broader range of products and services or more attractive pricing than us. If we are unable to offer competitive products and services, our business may be negatively affected. Many of our competitors are not subject to the same degree of regulation that we are as an FDIC-insured \n35\nTable of \nContents\ninstitution, which gives them greater operating flexibility and reduces their expenses relative to ours. As a result, these non-bank competitors have certain advantages over us in accessing funding and in providing various services.\nWe also compete against community banks that have strong local ties. These smaller institutions are likely to cater to the same small and mid-sized businesses that we target and to use a relationship-based approach similar to ours. In addition, our competitors may seek to gain market share by pricing below the current market rates for loans and paying higher rates for deposits. The banking business in our primary market areas is very competitive, and the level of competition facing us may increase further, which may limit our asset growth and financial results.\nWe continually encounter technological change, and we may have fewer resources than many of our competitors to continue to invest in technological improvements and innovations.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services, including innovative ways that customers can make payments or manage their accounts, such as through the use of digital wallets or digital currencies. In addition to better serving customers, effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our clients, which may adversely affect our results of operations and future prospects.\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems, or those of our third-party service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt our business, result in unintentional disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.\nAs a financial institution, our operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks. Any failure, interruption or breach in security or operational integrity of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our online banking system, customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit and loan servicing and other systems. The security and integrity of our systems could be threatened by a variety of interruptions or information security breaches, including those caused by computer hacking, cyber-attacks, electronic fraudulent activity or attempted theft of financial assets. We cannot assure you that any such failures, interruption or security breaches will not occur, or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed. While we have certain protective policies and procedures in place, the nature and sophistication of the threats continue to evolve. We may be required to expend significant additional resources in the future to modify and enhance our protective measures.\nAdditionally, we face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing agents, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source of an attack on, or breach of, our operational systems. Any failures, interruptions or security breaches in our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, result in a violation of privacy or other laws, or expose us to civil litigation, regulatory fines or losses not covered by insurance.\nFuture hurricanes or other adverse weather events could negatively affect our local economies or disrupt our operations, which would have an adverse effect on us.\nAs illustrated in recent years by the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Michael, our markets in Alabama and Florida, like other coastal areas, are susceptible to hurricanes and tropical storms. Such weather events can disrupt our operations, result in damage to our properties and negatively affect the local economies in which we operate. We cannot predict whether or to what extent damage that may be caused by future hurricanes or other weather events will affect our operations or the economies in our market areas, but such weather events could result in a decline in loan originations, a decline in the value or destruction of properties or other collateral securing our loans and an increase in the delinquencies, foreclosures and loan losses. Our business or results of operations may be adversely affected by these and other negative effects of hurricanes or other significant weather events.\n36\nTable of \nContents\nWe may incur environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we take title.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. In the course of our business, we may own or foreclose and take title to real estate and could become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. In addition, we acquire branches and real estate in connection with our acquisitions of banks. We may become responsible to a governmental agency or third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean-up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with environmental investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. If we were to become subject to significant environmental liabilities, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations could be interrupted if certain external vendors on which we rely experience difficulty, terminate their services or fail to comply with banking laws and regulations.\nWe depend to a significant extent on relationships with third party service providers. Specifically, we utilize third-party core banking services and receive credit card and debit card services, branch capture services, Internet banking services and services complementary to our banking products from various third-party service providers. If these third-party service providers experience difficulties or terminate their services and we are unable to replace them with other service providers, our operations could be interrupted. It may be difficult for us to replace some of our third-party vendors, particularly vendors providing our core banking, credit card and debit card services, in a timely manner if they were unwilling or unable to provide us with these services in the future for any reason. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Even if we are able to replace them, it may be at higher cost to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, if a third-party provider fails to provide the services we require, fails to meet contractual requirements, such as compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or suffers a cyber-attack or other security breach, our business could suffer economic and reputational harm that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur earnings could be adversely impacted by incidences of fraud and compliance failure.\nFinancial institutions are inherently exposed to fraud risk. A fraud can be perpetrated by a customer of our bank subsidiary, an employee, a vendor, or members of the general public. We are most subject to fraud and compliance risk in connection with the origination of loans, ACH transactions, wire transactions, ATM transactions, and checking transactions. Our largest fraud risk, associated with the origination of loans, includes the intentional misstatement of information in property appraisals or other underwriting documentation provided to us by third parties. Compliance risk is the risk that loans are not originated in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and our standards. There can be no assurance that we can prevent or detect acts of fraud or violation of law or our compliance standards by the third parties that we deal with. Repeated incidences of fraud or compliance failures would adversely impact the performance of our loan portfolio.\nOur banking relationships with the Cuban Embassy and Banco Internacional de Comercia, S.A. (\u201cBICSA\u201d) may increase our compliance risk and compliance costs.\nU.S. persons, including U.S. banks, are restricted in their ability to establish relationships and engage in transactions with Cuba and Cuban persons pursuant to the existing U.S. embargo and the Cuban Assets Control Regulations. However, as a result of our acquisition of Stonegate Bank in 2017, we maintain a customer relationship to handle the accounts for Cuba\u2019s diplomatic missions at the United Nations and for the Cuban Interests Section (now the Cuban Embassy) in Washington, D.C. This relationship was established in May 2015 pursuant to a special license granted to Stonegate Bank by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) in connection with the reestablishment of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Cuba. In July 2015, Stonegate Bank established a correspondent banking relationship with Banco Internacional de Comercio, S.A. (\u201cBICSA\u201d) in Havana, Cuba.\nCross-border correspondent banking relationships pose unique risks because they create situations in which a U.S. financial institution will be handling funds from a foreign financial institution whose customers may not be transparent to the U.S. financial institution. Moreover, Cuban financial institutions are not subject to the same or similar regulatory guidelines as U.S. banks; therefore, these foreign institutions may pose a higher money laundering risk to their respective U.S. bank correspondent(s). Investigations have determined that, in the past, foreign correspondent accounts have been used by drug traffickers and other criminal elements to launder funds. Shell companies are sometimes used in the layering process to hide the true ownership of accounts at foreign correspondent financial institutions. Because of the large amount of funds, multiple transactions, and the U.S. bank\u2019s potential lack of familiarity with a foreign correspondent financial \n37\nTable of \nContents\ninstitution\u2019s customer, criminals and terrorists can more easily conceal the source and use of illicit funds. Consequently, we may have a higher risk of noncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering (\u201cBSA/AML\u201d) rules due to our correspondent banking relationship with BICSA and will likely need to more closely monitor transactions related to correspondent accounts in Cuba, potentially resulting in increased compliance costs. Our failure to strictly adhere to the terms and requirements of our OFAC license or our failure to adequately manage our BSA/AML compliance risk in light of our correspondent banking relationship with BICSA could result in regulatory or other actions being taken against us, which could significantly increase our compliance costs and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Proposed Acquisition of Happy Bancshares, Inc.\nWe may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the merger.\nThe success of the merger of Happy with and into us will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine our and Happy organizations. If we are not able to achieve this objective, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer than expected to be realized.\nWe and Happy have operated and, until the completion of the merger, will continue to operate, independently. It is possible that the integration process or other factors could result in the loss or departure of key employees, the disruption of the ongoing business of Happy or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. It is also possible that clients, customers, depositors and counterparties of Happy could choose to discontinue their relationships with the combined company post-merger because they prefer doing business with Happy or for any other reason, which would adversely affect the future performance of the combined company. These transition matters could have an adverse effect on each of us and Happy during the pre-merger period and for an undetermined time after the completion of the merger.\nThe completion of the merger is subject to the consent and approval of the Federal Reserve Board, which may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the merger.\nOn December 16, 2021, we received approval from the Arkansas State Banking Board and the Arkansas State Bank Commissioner of its applications for the merger. Before the merger may be completed, however, we and Happy must also obtain approval of the merger from the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board may impose conditions on its granting of such approval. Although we and Happy do not currently expect that any such material conditions or changes would be imposed, there can be no assurance that they will not be, and such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying completion of the merger or imposing additional costs or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the merger, any of which might have an adverse effect on the combined company following the merger. In addition, if there is an adverse development in either company\u2019s regulatory standing, we may be required to withdraw our application for approval of the proposed merger and, if possible, resubmit it after the applicable supervisory concerns have been resolved. Finally, we and Happy have each agreed to use its commercially reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable law to consummate the merger. Such actions may entail costs and may adversely affect us, Happy, or the combined company following the merger.\nThe combined company expects to incur substantial expenses related to the merger.\nThe combined company expects to incur substantial expenses in connection with completing the merger and combining the business, operations, networks, systems, technologies, policies and procedures of the two companies. Although we and Happy have assumed that a certain level of transaction and combination expenses would be incurred, there are a number of factors beyond their control that could affect the total amount or the timing of their combination expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time. Due to these factors, the transaction and combination expenses associated with the merger could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings that the combined company expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings related to the combination of the businesses following the completion of the merger. In addition, many of these expenses will be incurred regardless of whether the merger is completed. As a result of these expenses, both we and Happy expect to take charges against our respective earnings before and after the completion of the merger. The charges taken in connection with the merger are expected to be significant, although the aggregate amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present.\n38\nTable of \nContents\nRisks Related to Owning Our Stock\nThe rights of our common shareholders are subordinate to the holders of any debt securities that we may issue from time to time and may be subordinate to the holders of any series of preferred stock that may issue in the future.\nOn April 3, 2017, we issued $300.0 million of 5.625% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes, which mature in 2027, and on January 18, 2022, we issued $300.0 million of 3.125% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes, which mature in 2032. Because these subordinated notes are senior to our shares of common stock, in the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of any such subordinated notes then outstanding must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to the holders of our common stock.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, we also have $73.3 million of outstanding subordinated debentures issued in connection with trust preferred securities. Payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities are unconditionally guaranteed by us. The subordinated debentures are senior to our shares of common stock. As a result, we must make payments on the subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and, in the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to the holders of our common stock. We have the right to defer distributions on the subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) for up to five years, during which time no dividends may be paid to holders of our capital stock. If we elect to defer or if we default with respect to our obligations to make payments on these subordinated debentures, this would likely have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock.\nOur board of directors has the authority to issue in the aggregate up to 5,500,000 shares of preferred stock, and to incur senior or subordinated indebtedness, generally without shareholder approval. Our preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights that may be superior to the rights of our common stock. In addition, like our outstanding subordinated debentures, any future indebtedness that we incur would be expected to be senior to our common stock with respect to payment upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. Accordingly, common shareholders bear the risk that our future issuances of debt or equity securities or our incurrence of other borrowings will negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe may be unable to, or choose not to, pay dividends on our common stock.\nAlthough we have paid a quarterly dividend on our common stock since 2003 and expect to continue this practice, we cannot assure you of our ability to continue. Our ability to pay dividends depends on the following factors, among others:\n\u2022\nWe may not have sufficient earnings since our primary source of income, the payment of dividends to us by our bank subsidiary, is subject to federal and state laws that limit the ability of that bank to pay dividends.\n\u2022\nFederal Reserve Board policy requires bank holding companies to pay cash dividends on common stock only out of net income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization\u2019s expected future needs and financial condition.\n\u2022\nBefore dividends may be paid on our common stock in any year, payments must be made on our subordinated debentures.\n\u2022\nOur board of directors may determine that, even though funds are available for dividend payments, retaining the funds for internal uses, such as expansion of our operations, is a better strategy.\nIf we fail to pay dividends, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock may be the sole opportunity for gains on an investment in our common stock. In addition, in the event our bank subsidiary becomes unable, due to regulatory restrictions, capital planning needs or otherwise, to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to service our debt, pay our other obligations or pay dividends on our common stock. Accordingly, our inability to receive dividends from our bank subsidiary could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and the value of your investment in our common stock.\n39\nTable of \nContents", "item7": ">Item 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis presents our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December\u00a031, 2021, 2020 and 2019. This discussion should be read together with the \u201cSummary Consolidated Financial Data,\u201d our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, and other financial data included in this document. In addition to the historical information provided below, we have made certain estimates and forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these estimates and in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those discussed in the section of this document captioned \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d and elsewhere in this document. Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cHBI,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cour\u201d refer to Home BancShares, Inc. on a consolidated basis.\nGeneral\nWe are a bank holding company headquartered in Conway, Arkansas, offering a broad array of financial services through our wholly owned bank subsidiary, Centennial Bank (\u201cCentennial\u201d). As of December\u00a031, 2021, we had, on a consolidated basis, total assets of $18.05 billion, loans receivable, net of $9.60 billion, total deposits of $14.26 billion, and stockholders\u2019 equity of $2.77 billion. \nWe generate most of our revenue from interest on loans and investments, service charges, and mortgage banking income. Deposits and FHLB borrowed funds are our primary source of funding. Our largest expenses are interest on our funding sources, salaries and related employee benefits and occupancy and equipment. We measure our performance by calculating our net interest margin, return on average assets and return on average common equity. We also measure our performance by our efficiency ratio and efficiency ratio, as adjusted (non-GAAP). The efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing non-interest expense less amortization of core deposit intangibles by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and non-interest income. The efficiency ratio, as adjusted, is a meaningful non-GAAP measure for management, as it excludes certain items and is calculated by dividing non-interest expense less amortization of core deposit intangibles by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and non-interest income excluding certain items such as merger expenses, hurricane expenses and/or gains and losses.\nTable 1: Key Financial Measures\nAs of or for the Years Ended December 31,\n2021\n2020\n2019\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nTotal assets\n$\n18,052,138\u00a0\n$\n16,398,804\u00a0\n$\n15,032,047\u00a0\nLoans receivable\n9,836,089\u00a0\n11,220,721\u00a0\n10,869,710\u00a0\nAllowance for credit losses\n(236,714)\n(245,473)\n(102,122)\nTotal deposits\n14,260,570\u00a0\n12,725,790\u00a0\n11,278,383\u00a0\nTotal stockholders\u2019 equity\n2,765,721\u00a0\n2,605,758\u00a0\n2,511,531\u00a0\nNet income\n319,021\u00a0\n214,448\u00a0\n289,539\u00a0\nBasic earnings per share\n$\n1.94\u00a0\n$\n1.30\u00a0\n$\n1.73\u00a0\nDiluted earnings per share\n1.94\u00a0\n1.30\u00a0\n1.73\u00a0\nBook value per share\n16.90\u00a0\n15.78\u00a0\n15.10\u00a0\nTangible book value per share (non-GAAP)\n(1)\n10.80\u00a0\n9.70\u00a0\n9.12\u00a0\nNet interest margin\n3.66\u00a0\n%\n4.06\u00a0\n%\n4.29\u00a0\n%\nEfficiency ratio\n40.81\u00a0\n40.20\u00a0\n40.34\u00a0\nEfficiency ratio, as adjusted (non-GAAP)\n(2)\n42.12\u00a0\n40.36\u00a0\n40.55\u00a0\nReturn on average assets\n1.83\u00a0\n1.33\u00a0\n1.93\u00a0\nReturn on average common equity\n11.89\u00a0\n8.57\u00a0\n12.01\u00a0\n(1)\nSee Table 25 for the non-GAAP tabular reconciliation.\n(2)\nSee Table 29 for the non-GAAP tabular reconciliation.\n45\nTable of \nContents\n2021 Overview\nRecent Developments \u2013 COVID-19\nThe Company has been, and may continue to be, impacted by the novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic. Throughout 2021, the spread of the Delta and Omicron variants resulted in increased infection rates, fueling fears of a virus resurgence. As a result, significant uncertainty remains about the duration of the pandemic as well as the timing and extent of the economic recovery. We continue to evaluate protocols and processes in place to execute our business continuity plans and help promote the health and safety of our employees and customers. To support our customers or to comply with law, we have deferred loan payments for certain consumer and commercial customers, and we have suspended residential property foreclosure sales, evictions, and involuntary automobile repossessions, and have offered fee waivers, payment deferrals, and other expanded assistance for automobile, mortgage, small business and personal lending customers.  \nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, our loan deferrals decreased to $190.7\u00a0million on 26 loans from the December 31, 2020 balance of $330.7 million on 56 loans.  All of the customers currently on deferment chose principal deferment only and now have returned to paying interest monthly.  The hospitality sector has been most negatively impacted by COVID-19 and represents approximately 76% of the deferment balance as of December\u00a031, 2021.  The geographic distribution of these deferrals is similar through all of our markets.  Our review of deferment requests required updated interim operating statements, balance sheet and liquidity verifications, and validation of the current risk rating.\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES\u201d Act) established a new federal economic relief program administered by the Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) called the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d), which provides for 100% federally guaranteed loans to be issued by participating private financial institutions to small businesses for payroll and certain other permitted expenses.  PPP loans are forgivable, in whole or in part, so long as employee and compensation levels of the borrower are maintained, and the proceeds are used for payroll and other permitted purposes in accordance with the requirements of the PPP. These loans carry a fixed rate of 1.00% and a term of two years, if not forgiven, in whole or in part. Payments were deferred for the first six months of the loan. The Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (\u201cPPP/HCEA Act\u201d) was signed into law in April 2020. The PPP/HCEA Act authorizes additional funds under the CARES Act for PPP loans to be issued by financial institutions through the SBA. The Consolidated Appropriations Act (\u201cCAA\u201d) was signed into law in December 2020. The CAA also authorizes additional funds under the CARES Act for PPP loans to be issued by financial institutions through the SBA with a term of five years.  As of December\u00a031, 2021, as a participating lender, we have generated 12,971 loans to both existing and new customers totaling $1.23 billion. As of December\u00a031, 2021, the outstanding PPP loan balances were $112.8\u00a0million. The average loan size was $131,000.\nDespite the improvements in the economic and public health outlooks in the United States during 2021, the emergence of the Delta variant during the second quarter and the Omicron variant during the fourth quarter have resulted in significant uncertainty about the future impact of the pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Should current economic conditions deteriorate or if the pandemic continues to intensify through the spread of more contagious or severe strains of COVID-19, the pandemic could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and financial condition.\n46\nTable of \nContents\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020\nOur net income increased $104.6\u00a0million, or 48.8%, to $319.0\u00a0million for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021, from $214.4\u00a0million for the same period in 2020. On a diluted earnings per share basis, our earnings were $1.94 per share for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021 and $1.30 per share for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020. During the year ended December\u00a031, 2021, the Company did not record a provision for credit losses but did record a $4.8 million negative provision for unfunded commitments compared to a $112.3 million provision for credit losses and a $17.0 million provision for unfunded commitments for a total credit loss expense of $129.3 million for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020. The $4.8 million negative provision for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021 was due to a single commercial & industrial loan for which a reserve was no longer considered necessary due to the borrower\u2019s current cash flow position. The $129.3 million of total credit loss expense for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020 was primarily due to the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, with $9.3 million as a result of the acquisition of LH-Finance on February 29, 2020. The Company\u2019s provisioning model is closely tied to unemployment rate projections which have continued to improve since the fourth quarter of 2020. The Company determined that an additional provision for credit losses was not necessary.  Despite the improvements in the economic and public health outlooks in the United States during 2021, the emergence of the Delta variant during the second quarter and the Omicron variant during the fourth quarter have resulted in significant uncertainty about the future impact of the pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial condition. As a result, the Company determined that a negative provision for credit losses was not appropriate at this time, and the current level of the allowance for credit losses was considered adequate as of December 31, 2021. The Company also recorded a $7.2 million adjustment for the increase in fair market value of marketable securities, $12.5 million of special dividend income from our equity investments, $5.1 million recovery on historic losses from loans charged-off prior to acquisition, $1.9 million of merger and acquisition expense and a $219,000 gain on sale of investment securities. \nTotal interest expense decreased by $41.2 million, or 44.1%, and non-interest income increased by $25.8 million, or 23.1%. This was partially offset by a $50.8 million, or 7.5%, decrease in total interest income and a $11.1 million, or 3.9%, increase in non-interest expense. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a $38.2 million decrease in interest on deposits and a $1.9 million decrease in interest on FHLB borrowed funds.  The increase in non-interest income was primarily due to a $9.2 million increase in the fair value adjustment on marketable securities, an $8.3 million increase in other income, a $5.8 million increase in other service charges and fees, a $2.4 million increase in dividends from FHLB, FRB, FNBB & other and a $1.7 million increase in gain on sale of SBA loans and was partially offset by a $3.4 million decrease in mortgage lending income.  The decrease in interest income was primarily due to a $53.4 million decrease in loan interest income. The increase in non-interest expense was due to a $6.8 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $5.2 million increase in data processing expense and a $1.2 million increase in merger and acquisition expense and was partially offset by a $1.8 million decrease in occupancy and equipment expense.  Income tax expense increased by $34.5 million during 2021 due to an increase in net income.\n \nOur net interest margin decreased from 4.06% for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020 to 3.66% for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021. The yield on interest earning assets was 3.99% and 4.70% for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, respectively, as average interest earning assets increased from $14.50 billion to $15.86 billion. The increase in average earning assets is primarily the result of a $1.84 billion increase in average interest-bearing balances due from banks and a $659.0 million increase in average investment securities, \npartially offset by the $1.13 billion decrease in average loans receivable. Average PPP loan balances were $434.7 million for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021. These loans bear interest at 1.00% plus the accretion of the deferred origination fee. Including deferred fees, we recognized total interest income of $35.6 million on PPP loans for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021.\n \nThe PPP loans were accretive to the net interest margin by 13 basis points for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021.\n \nThis was primarily due to approximately $910.1 million of the Company\u2019s PPP loans being forgiven during 2021 which included the acceleration of $24.8 million in deferred fees for the loans that were forgiven. As of December\u00a031, 2021, the Company had $3.6 million in remaining unamortized PPP fees. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting governmental response have created a significant amount of excess liquidity in the market.\n \nAs a result, we had an increase of $1.84 billion in average interest-bearing cash balances for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021 compared to the year ended December\u00a031, 2020. This excess liquidity was dilutive to the net interest margin by 46 basis points. For the years ended December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, we\n \nrecognized $20.2 million and $27.4 million, respectively, in total net accretion for acquired loans and deposits. The reduction in accretion was dilutive to the net interest margin by 4 basis points. We recognized $6.7 million in event interest income for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021 compared to $2.1 million in event income for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020. This increased the net interest margin by 3 basis points.\n \nOur efficiency ratio was 40.81% for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021, compared to 40.20% for the same period in 2020. For the year ended December\u00a031, 2021, our efficiency ratio, as adjusted (non-GAAP), was 42.12%, compared to 40.36% reported for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020. (See Table 29 for the non-GAAP tabular reconciliation).\n47\nTable of \nContents\nOur return on average assets was 1.83% for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021, compared to 1.33% for the same period in 2020. Our return on average common equity was 11.89% for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021, compared to 8.57% for the same period in 2020.\nFinancial Condition as of and for the Years Ended December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020\nOur total assets as of December\u00a031, 2021 increased $1.65 billion to $18.05 billion from the $16.40 billion reported as of December\u00a031, 2020. Cash and cash equivalents increased $2.39 billion, or 188.84%. \nThe increase in cash and cash equivalents is due to loan paydowns as well as the significant amount of excess liquidity in the market as a continued result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying governmental response.\n  Our loan portfolio balance decreased $1.38 billion to $9.84\u00a0billion as of December\u00a031, 2021, from $11.22 billion as of December\u00a031, 2020. The decrease in the loan portfolio is due to organic loan decline of $822.2 million and $910.1 million of the Company\u2019s PPP loans being forgiven during 2021, which was partially offset by $347.7 million in new PPP loan originations during 2021\n. \nTotal deposits increased $1.53\u00a0billion to $14.26\u00a0billion as of December\u00a031, 2021 compared to $12.73\u00a0billion as of December\u00a031, 2020, which was due to customers holding higher deposit balances in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the resulting governmental response to the pandemic. Stockholders\u2019 equity increased $160.0\u00a0million to $2.77\u00a0billion as of December\u00a031, 2021, compared to $2.61\u00a0billion as of December\u00a031, 2020. The increase in stockholders\u2019 equity is primarily associated with the $319.0 million in net income, which was partially offset by the $33.7\u00a0million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income, $92.1\u00a0million of shareholder dividends paid and the repurchase of $44.5 million of our common stock during 2021. The improvement in stockholders\u2019 equity was 6.1% for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021 compared to December\u00a031, 2020. \nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, our non-performing loans decreased to $50.2 million, or 0.51%, of total loans from $74.1 million, or 0.66%, of total loans as of December\u00a031, 2020. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of non-performing loans increased to\n \n471.61% as of December\u00a031, 2021, compared to 331.10% as of December\u00a031, 2020. Non-performing loans from our Arkansas franchise were $13.9 million at December\u00a031, 2021 compared to $24.1 million as of December\u00a031, 2020. Non-performing loans from our Florida franchise were $26.8 million at December\u00a031, 2021 compared to $43.1 million as of December\u00a031, 2020. Non-performing loans from our Alabama franchise were $470,000 at December\u00a031, 2021 compared to\n \n$530,000 as of December\u00a031, 2020. Non-performing loans from our SPF franchise were $1.5 million at December\u00a031, 2021 compared to $3.6 million as of December\u00a031, 2020. Non-performing loans from our Centennial CFG franchise were $7.5 million at December\u00a031, 2021 compared to $2.8 million as of December\u00a031, 2020.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, our non-performing assets decreased to $51.8 million, or\n \n0.29%, of total assets from $78.6 million, or 0.48%, of total assets as of December\u00a031, 2020. Non-performing assets from our Arkansas franchise were $14.4 million at December\u00a031, 2021 compared to $25.6 million as of December\u00a031, 2020. Non-performing assets from our Florida franchise were $27.9 million at December\u00a031, 2021 compared to $46.0 million as of December\u00a031, 2020. Non-performing assets from our Alabama franchise were $470,000 at December\u00a031, 2021 compared to $564,000 as of December\u00a031, 2020. Non-performing assets from our SPF franchise were $1.5 million at December\u00a031, 2021 compared to $3.6 million as of December\u00a031, 2020. Non-performing assets from our CFG franchise were\n \n$7.5 million at December\u00a031, 2021 compared to $2.8 million as of December\u00a031, 2020. \nThe $7.5 million balance of non-accrual loans for our Centennial CFG market consists of two loans that are assessed for Credit risk by the Federal Reserve under the Shared National Credit Program. The decision to place these loans on non-accrual status was made by the Federal Reserve and not the Company. The loans that make up the total balance are still current on both principal and interest. However, all interest payments are currently being applied to the principal balance. Because the Federal Reserve required us to place these loans on non-accrual status, we have reversed any interest that had accrued subsequent to the non-accrual date designated by the Federal Reserve.\n48\nTable of \nContents\n2020 Overview\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December\u00a031, 2020 and 2019\nOur net income decreased $75.1 million, or 25.9%, to $214.4 million for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020, from $289.5 million for the same period in 2019.  On a diluted earnings per share basis, our earnings were $1.30 per share for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020 and $1.73 per share for the year ended December\u00a031, 2019.  As a result of COVID-19, the unemployment rate projections significantly increased from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. Additionally, the ongoing uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the Company increasing reserves on deferred loans and loans 30 days or more past maturity. These impacts of COVID-19 resulted in the Company recording a $102.1 million provision for credit losses on loans, an $842,000 provision for credit losses on investment securities, and a $2.0 million write-down for the fair value adjustment on marketable securities. The Company also recorded a $17.0 million  provision for unfunded commitments which was due to an increase in the expected funding percentages for the Company\u2019s unfunded commitments as well as an increase in the unemployment rate projections from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, due to COVID-19. We incurred $10.0 million of expense as a result of our LH-Finance acquisition, which we completed on February 29, 2020, including $9.3 million for the provision for credit losses and $711,000 of acquisition expenses.  The acquired loan portfolio is now housed in our SPF division.  The Company also had $1.1 million of expense for outsourced special projects, $10.2 million of special dividend income from one of our equity investments and $981,000 of increased depreciation expense related to the second quarter write-off of the Company\u2019s Marathon, Florida branch office, which the Company made the strategic decision to demolish and rebuild at its existing location. The summation of all these items resulted in net expense of $123.8 million, or $91.5 million after tax.  \nTotal interest income decreased $42.0 million, or 5.9%, and non-interest expense increased $11.6 million, or 4.2%.  This was offset by a $61.4 million, or 39.6%, decrease in total interest expense and a $12.3 million, or 12.3%, increase in non-interest income. The primary drivers of the decrease in interest income were a $33.0 million decrease in loan interest income, a $5.7 million increase in investment security income and a $3.3 million decrease in interest income on deposits with other banks. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to a $9.8 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $3.0 million increase in occupancy and equipment expense, a $2.9 million increase in data processing expense, partially offset by a $4.7 million decrease in other operating expenses. The decrease in interest expense was due to a $51.0 million decrease in interest on deposits and a $7.7 million decrease in interest on FHLB borrowed funds. The increase in non-interest income was primarily due to a $14.8 million increase in mortgage lending income, a $4.8 million increase in dividend income from FHLB, FRB, FNBB and other equity investments, and a $3.8 million increase in other income, partially offset by a $4.5 million decrease in service charges on deposit accounts, a $3.4 million decrease in other service charges and fees and a $2.0 million write-down for the fair value adjustment on marketable securities.  Income tax expense decreased by $32.8 million during the year due a reduction in net income as well as $3.7 million in tax expense incurred in the third quarter of 2019 due to the Company surrendering $47.5 million of underperforming separate account bank owned life insurance. \nOur net interest margin decreased from 4.29% for the year ended December\u00a031, 2019 to 4.06% for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020.  The yield on interest earning assets was 4.70% and 5.45% for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as average interest earning assets increased from $13.26 billion to $14.50 billion. The increase in average earning assets is primarily the result of a $542.5 million increase in average loans receivable, a $506.6 million increase in average interest-bearing balances due from banks and a $187.9 million increase in average investment securities. Average PPP loan balances were $547.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. These loans bear interest at 1.00% plus the accretion of the origination fee. We recognized total interest income of $19.2 million on PPP loans for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020. The PPP loans were dilutive to the net interest margin by 2 basis points for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020. As a result of the significant excess liquidity in the market created by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting government responses, we had an increase of $506.6 million in average interest-bearing cash balances for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020 compared to the year ended December\u00a031, 2019.  This excess liquidity was dilutive to the net interest margin by 17 basis points. For the year ended December\u00a031, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $27.4 million and $35.9 million, respectively, in total net accretion for acquired loans and deposits. The reduction in accretion was dilutive to the net interest margin by 5 basis points. We recognized $2.1 million event interest income for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020 compared to $3.3 million for the year ended December\u00a031, 2019. This was dilutive to the net interest margin by 1 basis point. The rate on interest bearing liabilities was 0.89% and 1.55% for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as average interest-bearing liabilities increased from $10.02 billion to $10.50 billion. The reduction in yield on loans due to the low interest rate on PPP loans, the impact of the excess liquidity, the reduction in accretion income, and the reduction in loan payoff events, reduced the net interest margin by 25 basis points for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020.\n49\nTable of \nContents\nOur efficiency ratio was 40.20% for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020, compared to 40.34% for the same period in 2019.  For the year ended December\u00a031, 2020, our efficiency ratio, as adjusted (non-GAAP), was 40.36%, compared to 40.55% reported for the year ended December\u00a031, 2019. (See Table 29 for the non-GAAP tabular reconciliation).\nOur return on average assets was 1.33% for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020, compared to 1.93% for the same period in 2019. Our return on average common equity was 8.57% for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020, compared to 12.01% for the same period in 2019.\nFinancial Condition as of and for the Years Ended December\u00a031, 2020 and 2019\nOur total assets as of December 31, 2020 increased $1.37 billion to $16.40 billion from the $15.03 billion reported as of December 31, 2019. Cash and cash equivalents increased $773.2 million, or 157.6%, due to the significant excess liquidity in the market created by the COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying governmental response. Our loan portfolio balance increased $351.0 million to $11.22 billion as of December 31, 2020, from $10.87 billion as of December 31, 2019. The increase in the loan portfolio is due to the $675.2 million of PPP loans as well as the acquisition of $406.2 million of loans from LH-Finance during the first quarter of 2020, which was offset by $730.4 million in organic loan decline for the year ended December 31, 2020.  Total deposits increased $1.45 billion to $12.73 billion as of December 31, 2020 compared to $11.28 billion as of December 31, 2019, which was due to customers holding higher deposit balances in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the resulting governmental response to the pandemic. Stockholders\u2019 equity increased $94.2 million to $2.61 billion as of December 31, 2020, compared to $2.51 billion as of December 31, 2019.  The increase in stockholders\u2019 equity is primarily associated with the $214.4 million in net income and the $27.9 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, which were partially offset by the $44.0 million impact of the adoption of ASC 326, $87.7 million of shareholder dividends paid and the repurchase of $25.7 million of our common stock during 2020.  The improvement in stockholders\u2019 equity was 3.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019. \nAs of December 31, 2020, our non-performing loans increased to $74.1 million, or 0.66%, of total loans from $54.8 million, or 0.50%, of total loans as of December 31, 2019. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of non-performing loans increased to 331.10% as of December 31, 2020, compared to 186.20% as of December 31, 2019.  Non-performing loans from our Arkansas franchise were $24.1 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $17.9 million as of December 31, 2019.  Non-performing loans from our Florida franchise were $43.1 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $34.7 million as of December 31, 2019.  Non-performing loans from our Alabama franchise were $530,000 at December 31, 2020 compared to $429,000 as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing loans from our SPF franchise were $3.6 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $1.8 million as of December 31, 2019.  Non-performing loans from our Centennial CFG franchise were $2.8 million at December 31, 2020 compared to zero as of December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our non-performing assets increased to $78.6 million, or 0.48%, of total assets from $64.4 million, or 0.43%, of total assets as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing assets from our Arkansas franchise were $25.6 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $22.9 million as of December 31, 2019. Non-performing assets from our Florida franchise were $46.0 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $39.2 million as of December 31, 2019.  Non-performing assets from our Alabama franchise were $564,000 at December 31, 2020 compared to $463,000 as of December 31, 2019.  Non-performing assets from our SPF franchise were $3.6 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $1.8 million as of December 31, 2019.  Non-performing assets from our CFG franchise were $2.8 million at December 31, 2020 compared to zero as of December 31, 2019. \nThe $2.8 million balance of non-accrual loans for our Centennial CFG  market consists of one loan that is assessed for Credit risk by the Federal Reserve under the Shared National Credit Program. The decision to place this loan on non-accrual status was made by the Federal Reserve and not the Company. The loan that makes up the total balance is still current on both principal and interest.  However, all interest payments are currently being applied to the principal balance.  Because the Federal Reserve required us to place this loan on non-accrual status, we have reversed any interest that had accrued subsequent to the non-accrual date designated by the Federal Reserve.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOverview\n. We prepare our consolidated financial statements based on the selection of certain accounting policies, generally accepted accounting principles and customary practices in the banking industry. These policies, in certain areas, require us to make significant estimates and assumptions. Our accounting policies are described in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included as part of this document.\n50\nTable of \nContents\nWe consider a policy critical if (i) the accounting estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the accounting estimate; and (ii) different estimates that could reasonably have been used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, would have a material impact on our financial statements. Using these criteria, we believe that the accounting policies most critical to us are those associated with our lending practices, including the accounting for the allowance for credit losses, foreclosed assets, investments, intangible assets, income taxes and stock options. \nRevenue Recognition\n. Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 606, \nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n (\"ASC Topic 606\"), establishes principles for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity's contracts to provide goods or services to customers. The core principle requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that it expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services recognized as performance obligations are satisfied. The majority of our revenue-generating transactions are not subject to ASC Topic 606, including revenue generated from financial instruments, such as our loans, letters of credit, investment securities and mortgage lending income, as these activities are subject to other GAAP discussed elsewhere within our disclosures. Descriptions of our revenue-generating activities that are within the scope of ASC Topic 606, which are presented in our income statements as components of non-interest income are as follows:\n\u2022\nService charges on deposit accounts \u2013 These represent general service fees for monthly account maintenance and activity or transaction-based fees and consist of transaction-based revenue, time-based revenue (service period), item-based revenue or some other individual attribute-based revenue. Revenue is recognized when our performance obligation is completed, which is generally monthly for account maintenance services or when a transaction has been completed (such as a wire transfer). Payment for such performance obligations are generally received at the time the performance obligations are satisfied.\n\u2022\nOther service charges and fees \u2013 These represent credit card interchange fees and Centennial CFG loan fees. The interchange fees are recorded in the period the performance obligation is satisfied which is generally the cash basis based on agreed upon contracts. Centennial CFG loan fees are based on loan or other negotiated agreements with customers and are accounted for under ASC Topic 310. Interchange fees were $16.4 million and $14.8 million for the years ended December\u00a031, 2021 and December\u00a031, 2020, respectively. Centennial CFG loan fees were $11.9 million and $8.3 million for the years ended December\u00a031, 2021 and December\u00a031, 2020, respectively.\nCredit Losses\n. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13, \nFinancial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\n, effective January 1, 2020. The guidance replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) methodology. The measurement of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables and held-to-maturity debt securities. It also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance (loan commitments, standby letters of credits, financial guarantees, and other similar instruments) and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor in accordance with Topic 842 on leases. ASC 326 requires enhanced disclosures related to the significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of a company\u2019s portfolio. In addition, ASC 326 made changes to the accounting for available-for-sale debt securities. One such change is to require credit losses to be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down on available for sale debt securities management does not intend to sell or believes that it is more likely than not, they will be required to sell. \nThe Company adopted ASC 326 using the modified retrospective method for loans and off-balance-sheet (\u201cOBS\u201d) credit exposures. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2020 are presented under ASC 326 while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP. The Company recorded a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to the allowance for credit losses of $44.0 million which was recognized through a $32.5 million adjustment to retained earnings, net of tax. This adjustment brought the beginning balance of the allowance for credit losses to $146.1 million as of January 1, 2020. In addition, the Company recorded a $15.5 million reserve on unfunded commitments, as of January 1, 2020, which was recognized through an $11.5 million adjustment to retained earnings, net of tax.  \n51\nTable of \nContents\nThe Company adopted ASC 326 using the prospective transition approach for financial assets purchased with credit deterioration (\u201cPCD\u201d) that were previously classified as purchased credit impaired (\u201cPCI\u201d) and accounted for under ASC 310-30. In 2019, the Company reevaluated its loan pools of purchased loans with deteriorated credit quality. These loans pools related specifically to acquired loans from the Heritage, Liberty, Landmark, Bay Cities, Bank of Commerce, Premier Bank, Stonegate and Shore Premier Finance acquisitions. At acquisition, a portion of these loans were recorded as purchased credit impaired loans on a pool by pool basis. Through the reevaluation of these loan pools, management determined that estimated losses for purchase credit impaired loans should be processed against the credit mark of the applicable pools. The remaining non-accretable mark was then moved to accretable mark to be recognized over the remaining weighted average life of the loan pools. The projected losses for these loans were less than the total credit mark. As such, the remaining $107.6 million of loans in these pools along with the $29.3 million in accretable yield was deemed to be immaterial and was reclassified out of the purchased credit impaired loans category. As of December 31, 2019, the Company no longer held any purchased loans with deteriorated credit quality. Therefore, the Company did not have any PCI loans upon adoption on of ASC 326 as of January 1, 2020. \nThe Company adopted ASC 326 using the prospective transition approach for debt securities for which other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized prior to January 1, 2020. As of December 31, 2019, the Company did not have any other-than-temporarily impaired investment securities. Therefore, upon adoption of ASC 326, the Company determined that an allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale securities was not material. However, the Company evaluated the investment portfolio during 2020 and determined that an $842,000 provision for credit losses was necessary. No additional provision was deemed necessary during the remainder of 2020 or for the 2021. See Note 3 for further discussion. \nInvestments \u2013 Available-for-sale\n. Securities available-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders\u2019 equity and other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes. Securities that are held as available-for-sale are used as a part of our asset/liability management strategy. Securities that may be sold in response to interest rate changes, changes in prepayment risk, the need to increase regulatory capital, and other similar factors are classified as available-for-sale. The Company evaluates all securities quarterly to determine if any securities in a loss position require a provision for credit losses in accordance with ASC 326, \nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\n. The Company first assesses whether it intends to sell or is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security\u2019s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For securities that do not meet this criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, and changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.\nLoans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\n. Except for loans acquired during our acquisitions, substantially all of our loans receivable are reported at their outstanding principal balance adjusted for any charge-offs, as it is management\u2019s intent to hold them for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff, except for mortgage loans held for sale. Interest income on loans is accrued over the term of the loans based on the principal balance outstanding.\nThe allowance for credit losses on loans receivable is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans\u2019 amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. Loans are charged off against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed and expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off. \nManagement estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or term as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in the national unemployment rate, gross domestic product, rental vacancy rate, housing price index and national retail sales index. \n52\nTable of \nContents\nThe allowance for credit losses is measured based on call report segment as these types of loans exhibit similar risk characteristics. The identified loan segments are as follows:\n\u2022\n1-4 family construction\n\u2022\nAll other construction\n\u2022\n1-4 family revolving home equity lines of credit (\u201cHELOC\u201d) & junior liens\n\u2022\n1-4 family senior liens\n\u2022\nMultifamily\n\u2022\nOwner occupies commercial real estate\n\u2022\nNon-owner occupied commercial real estate\n\u2022\nCommercial & industrial, agricultural, non-depository financial institutions, purchase/carry securities, other \n\u2022\nConsumer auto\n\u2022\nOther consumer\n\u2022\nOther consumer - SPF\nThe allowance for credit losses for each segment is measured through the use of the discounted cash flow method. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually that are considered to be collateral dependent are not included in the collective evaluation. For those loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows, collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. For loans that are not considered to be collateral dependent, an allowance is recorded based on the loss rate for the respective pool within the collective evaluation if a specific reserve is not recorded. \nExpected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications unless either of the following applies: \n\u2022\nManagement has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date that troubled debt restructuring will be executed with an individual borrower.\n\u2022\nThe extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally cancellable by the Company.\nManagement qualitatively adjusts model results for risk factors that are not considered within our modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools. These qualitative factors (\"Q-Factor\") and other qualitative adjustments may increase or decrease management's estimate of expected credit losses by a calculated percentage or amount based upon the estimated level of risk. The various risks that may be considered in making Q-Factor and other qualitative adjustments include, among other things, the impact of (i) changes in lending policies, procedures and strategies; (ii) changes in nature and volume of the portfolio; (iii) staff experience; (iv) changes in volume and trends in classified loans, delinquencies and nonaccruals; (v) concentration risk; (vi) trends in underlying collateral values; (vii) external factors such as competition, legal and regulatory environment; (viii) changes in the quality of the loan review system and (ix) economic conditions.\nLoans considered impaired, according to ASC 326, are loans for which, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The aggregate amount of impairment of loans is utilized in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and amount of provisions thereto. Losses on impaired loans are charged against the allowance for credit losses when in the process of collection, it appears likely that such losses will be realized. The accrual of interest on impaired loans is discontinued when, in management\u2019s opinion the collection of interest is doubtful or generally when loans are 90 days or more past due. When accrual of interest is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received in excess of principal due. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\n53\nTable of \nContents\nLoans are placed on non-accrual status when management believes that the borrower\u2019s financial condition, after giving consideration to economic and business conditions and collection efforts, is such that collection of interest is doubtful, or generally when loans are 90 days or more past due. Loans are charged against the allowance for credit losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Accrued interest related to non-accrual loans is generally charged against the allowance for credit losses when accrued in prior years and reversed from interest income if accrued in the current year. Interest income on non-accrual loans may be recognized to the extent cash payments are received, although the majority of payments received are usually applied to principal. Non-accrual loans are generally returned to accrual status when principal and interest payments are less than 90 days past due, the customer has made required payments for at least six months, and we reasonably expect to collect all principal and interest. \nAcquisition Accounting and Acquired Loans\n. We account for our acquisitions under FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting. All identifiable assets acquired, including loans, are recorded at fair value. In accordance with ASC 326, the Company records both a discount and an allowance for credit losses on acquired loans. All purchased loans are recorded at fair value in accordance with the fair value methodology prescribed in FASB ASC Topic 820, \nFair Value Measurements\n. The fair value estimates associated with the loans include estimates related to expected prepayments and the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal, interest and other cash flows. \nThe Company has purchased loans, some of which have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination. Purchase credit deteriorated (\u201cPCD\u201d) loans are recorded at the amount paid. An allowance for credit losses is determined using the same methodology as other loans. The initial allowance for credit losses determined on a collective basis is allocated to individual loans. The sum of the loan\u2019s purchase price and allowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a noncredit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded through the provision for credit loss. \nAllowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures\n: The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life.\nForeclosed Assets Held for Sale\n. Real estate and personal properties acquired through or in lieu of loan foreclosure are to be sold and are initially recorded at fair value at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Valuations are periodically performed by management, and the real estate and personal properties are carried at fair value less costs to sell. Gains and losses from the sale of other real estate and personal properties are recorded in non-interest income, and expenses used to maintain the properties are included in non-interest expenses.\nIntangible Assets\n. Intangible assets consist of goodwill and core deposit intangibles. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business acquisitions. The core deposit intangible represents the excess intangible value of acquired deposit customer relationships as determined by valuation specialists. The core deposit intangibles are being amortized over 48 to 121 months on a straight-line basis. Goodwill is not amortized but rather is evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis. We perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and core deposit intangibles as required by FASB ASC 350, \nIntangibles - Goodwill and Other\n, in the fourth quarter or more often if events and circumstances indicate there may be an impairment. \nIncome Taxes\n. We account for income taxes in accordance with income tax accounting guidance (ASC 740, \nIncome Taxes\n). The income tax accounting guidance results in two components of income tax expense: current and deferred. Current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period by applying the provisions of the enacted tax law to the taxable income or excess of deductions over revenues. We determine deferred income taxes using the liability (or balance sheet) method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and enacted changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.\n54\nTable of \nContents\nDeferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the tax position will be realized or sustained upon examination. The term \u201cmore likely than not\u201d means a likelihood of more than 50 percent; the terms \u201cexamined\u201d and \u201cupon examination\u201d also include resolution of the related appeals or litigation processes, if any. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The determination of whether or not a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold considers the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date and is subject to the management\u2019s judgment. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of evidence available, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nBoth we and our subsidiary file consolidated tax returns. Our subsidiary provides for income taxes on a separate return basis, and remits to us amounts determined to be currently payable.\nStock Compensation\n. In accordance with FASB ASC 718, \nCompensation - Stock Compensation\n, and FASB ASC 505-50, \nEquity-Based Payments to Non-Employees\n, the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant. We recognize compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of the option award over the vesting period of the award.\nAcquisitions\nLH-Finance\nOn February 29, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of LH-Finance, the marine lending division of People\u2019s United Bank, N.A. The Company paid a purchase price of approximately $421.2 million in cash. LH-Finance provides direct consumer financing for USCG registered high-end sail and power boats. Additionally, LH-Finance provides inventory floor plan lines of credit to marine dealers, primarily those selling USCG documented vessels. \nIncluding the purchase accounting adjustments, as of the acquisition date, LH-Finance had approximately $409.1 million in total assets, including $407.4 million in total loans, which resulted in goodwill of $14.6 million being recorded. \nThe acquired portfolio of loans is now housed in our SPF division. The SPF division is responsible for servicing the acquired loan portfolio and originating new loan production. In connection with this acquisition, we opened a new loan production office in Baltimore, Maryland.\nSee Note 2 \u201cBusiness Combinations\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the acquisition of LH-Finance.\nAcquisition of Marine Portfolio\nOn February 4, 2022, the Company completed the purchase of the performing marine loan portfolio of Utah-based LendingClub Bank (\u201cLendingClub\u201d). Under the terms of the purchase agreement with LendingClub, the Company acquired yacht loans totaling approximately $238 million. This portfolio of loans will be housed within the Company's Shore Premier Finance division, which will be responsible for servicing the acquired loan portfolio and originating new loan production. Upon completion of the acquisition, SPF has total loans receivable of approximately $1.13 billion.\nFuture Acquisition of Happy Bancshares, Inc.\nOn September 15, 2021, the Company and Centennial entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) with Happy Bancshares, Inc., a Texas corporation (\u201cHappy\u201d), and its wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Happy State Bank, a Texas banking association (\u201cHSB\u201d), under which the Company and Centennial will acquire Happy and HSB. The Agreement, as amended on October 18, 2021 and further amended on November 8, 2021, provides that, in a series of transactions, an acquisition subsidiary of the Company will merge into Happy and Happy will merge into the Company, with the Company as the surviving entity (collectively, the \u201cMerger\u201d). As soon as reasonably practicable following the Merger, HSB will merge into Centennial, with Centennial as the surviving entity.\n55\nTable of \nContents\nUnder the terms of the Agreement, as amended, the Company will issue approximately 42.3\u00a0million shares of its common stock to the shareholders of Happy upon the completion of the Merger. No cash consideration will be paid in connection with the Merger, except that holders of outstanding shares of Happy common stock at the time of the Merger will receive cash payments in lieu of any fractional shares of Company common stock to which they are otherwise entitled in connection with the Merger. In addition, the Company expects to pay an aggregate of up to approximately $11.0\u00a0million in cash in cancellation of certain stock appreciation rights issued by Happy that remain outstanding at the time of the Merger.   \n Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement, as amended, at the effective time of the Merger (the \u201cEffective Time\u201d), each outstanding share of common stock of Happy will be converted into the right to receive, without interest, 2.17 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock (the \u201cMerger Consideration\u201d). Each unvested restricted share of Happy common stock outstanding at the Effective Time will fully vest and be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. In addition, at the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Happy common stock will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the number of whole shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares, equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Happy common stock subject to the option, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration value over the exercise price of the option, less applicable tax withholdings, divided by (iii) the Company\u2019s Average Closing Price (defined below). Similarly, each stock appreciation right of Happy outstanding at the Effective Time will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Happy common stock subject to the stock appreciation right, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration value over the grant price of the stock appreciation right, less applicable tax withholdings. For purposes of these calculations, the Merger Consideration value will be determined using a volume-weighted average closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange over the 20 consecutive trading day period ending on the third business day prior to the closing of the Merger (\u201cthe Company\u2019s Average Closing Price\u201d), multiplied by 2.17. \nThe Merger is expected to close during the first quarter of 2022, and is subject to regulatory approvals and other conditions set forth in the Agreement. The Company received approval for the merger from the Arkansas State Banking Board and the Arkansas State Bank Commissioner as well as the approval of the shareholders of each company in December of 2021.\nWe will continue evaluating all types of potential bank acquisitions, which may include FDIC-assisted acquisitions as opportunities arise, to determine what is in the best interest of our Company. Our goal in making these decisions is to maximize the return to our investors.\nBranches\nAs opportunities arise, we will continue to open new (commonly referred to as \nde novo\n) branches in our current markets and in other attractive market areas. \nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, we had 160 branch locations. There were 76 branches in Arkansas, 78 branches in Florida, five branches in Alabama and one branch in New York City.\n56\nTable of \nContents\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December\u00a031, 2021, 2020 and 2019\nOur net income increased $104.6\u00a0million, or 48.8%, to $319.0\u00a0million for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021, from $214.4\u00a0million for the same period in 2020. On a diluted earnings per share basis, our earnings were $1.94 per share for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021 and $1.30 per share for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020. During the year ended December\u00a031, 2021, the Company did not record a provision for credit losses but did record a $4.8 million negative provision for unfunded commitments compared to a $112.3 million provision for credit losses and a $17.0 million provision for unfunded commitments for a total credit loss expense of $129.3 million for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020. The $4.8 million negative provision for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021 was due to a single commercial & industrial loan for which a reserve was no longer considered necessary due to the borrower\u2019s current cash flow position. The $129.3 million of total credit loss expense for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020 was primarily due to the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, with $9.3 million as a result of the acquisition of LH-Finance on February 29, 2020. The Company\u2019s provisioning model is closely tied to unemployment rate projections which have continued to improve since the fourth quarter of 2020. The Company determined that an additional provision for credit losses was not necessary.  Despite the improvements in the economic and public health outlooks in the United States during 2021, the emergence of the Delta variant during the second quarter and the Omicron variant during the fourth quarter have resulted in significant uncertainty about the future impact of the pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial condition. As a result, the Company determined that a negative provision for credit losses was not appropriate at this time, and the current level of the allowance for credit losses was considered adequate as of December 31, 2021. The Company also recorded a $7.2 million adjustment for the increase in fair market value of marketable securities, $12.5 million of special dividend income from our equity investments, $5.1 million recovery on historic losses from loans charged-off prior to acquisition, $1.9 million of merger and acquisition expense and a $219,000 gain on sale of investment securities.  \nOur net income decreased $75.1 million, or 25.9%, to $214.4 million for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020, from $289.5 million for the same period in 2019.  On a diluted earnings per share basis, our earnings were $1.30 per share for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020 and $1.73 per share for the year ended December\u00a031, 2019.  As a result of COVID-19, the unemployment rate projections significantly increased from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. Additionally, the ongoing uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the Company increasing reserves on deferred loans and loans 30 days or more past maturity. These impacts of COVID-19 resulted in the Company recording a $102.1 million provision for credit losses on loans, an $842,000 provision for credit losses on investment securities, and a $2.0 million write-down for the fair value adjustment on marketable securities. The Company also recorded a $17.0 million  provision for unfunded commitments which was due to an increase in the expected funding percentages for the Company\u2019s unfunded commitments as well as an increase in the unemployment rate projections from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, due to COVID-19. We incurred $10.0 million of expense as a result of our LH-Finance acquisition, which we completed on February 29, 2020, including $9.3 million for the provision for credit losses and $711,000 of acquisition expenses.  The acquired loan portfolio is now housed in our SPF division.  The Company also had $1.1 million of expense for outsourced special projects, $10.2 million of special dividend income from one of our equity investments and $981,000 of increased depreciation expense related to the second quarter write-off of the Company\u2019s Marathon, Florida branch office, which the Company made the strategic decision to demolish and rebuild at its existing location. The summation of all these items resulted in net expense of $123.8 million, or $91.5 million after tax.  \nNet Interest Income \nNet interest income, our principal source of earnings, is the difference between the interest income generated by earning assets and the total interest cost of the deposits and borrowings obtained to fund those assets. Factors affecting the level of net interest income include the volume of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, yields earned on loans and investments and rates paid on deposits and other borrowings, the level of non-performing loans and the amount of non-interest-bearing liabilities supporting earning assets. Net interest income is analyzed in the discussion and tables below on a fully taxable equivalent basis. The adjustment to convert certain income to a fully taxable equivalent basis consists of dividing tax-exempt income by one minus the combined federal and state income tax rate (25.740% for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021, 26.135% for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020 and 25.819% for year ended December\u00a031, 2019).\nThe Federal Reserve Board sets various benchmark rates, including the Federal Funds rate, and thereby influences the general market rates of interest, including the deposit and loan rates offered by financial institutions. The Federal Reserve lowered the target rate three times during 2019. First, the target rate was lowered to 2.00% to 2.25% on July 31, 2019; second, the rate was lowered on September 18, 2019 to 1.75% to 2.00%; and third, the rate was lowered on October 30, 2019 to 1.50% to 1.75%. The Federal Reserve lowered the target rate two times in 2020. First, the target rate was lowered to 1.00% to 1.25% on March 3, 2020; second, the rate was lowered to 0.00% to 0.25% on March 15, 2020. The target rate is currently at 0.00% to 0.25% as of December\u00a031, 2021.\n57\nTable of \nContents\nOur net interest margin decreased from 4.06% for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020 to 3.66% for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021. The yield on interest earning assets was 3.99% and 4.70% for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, respectively, as average interest earning assets increased from $14.50 billion to $15.86 billion. The increase in average earning assets is primarily the result of a $1.84 billion increase in average interest-bearing balances due from banks and a $659.0 million increase in average investment securities, \npartially offset by the $1.13 billion decrease in average loans receivable. Average PPP loan balances were $434.7 million for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021. These loans bear interest at 1.00% plus the accretion of the deferred origination fee. Including deferred fees, we recognized total interest income of $35.6 million on PPP loans for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021.\n \nThe PPP loans were accretive to the net interest margin by 13 basis points for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021.\n \nThis was primarily due to approximately $910.1 million of the Company\u2019s PPP loans being forgiven during 2021 which included the acceleration of $24.8 million in deferred fees for the loans that were forgiven. As of December\u00a031, 2021, the Company had $3.6 million in remaining unamortized PPP fees. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting governmental response have created a significant amount of excess liquidity in the market.\n \nAs a result, we had an increase of $1.84 billion in average interest-bearing cash balances for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021 compared to the year ended December\u00a031, 2020. This excess liquidity was dilutive to the net interest margin by 46 basis points. For the years ended December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, we\n \nrecognized $20.2 million and $27.4 million, respectively, in total net accretion for acquired loans and deposits. The reduction in accretion was dilutive to the net interest margin by 4 basis points. We recognized $6.7 million in event interest income for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021 compared to $2.1 million in event income for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020. This increased the net interest margin by 3 basis points.\n \nNet interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis decreased $8.5 million, or 1.45%, to $580.1 million for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021, from $588.6 million for the same period in 2020. This decrease in net interest income was the result of a $49.7 million decrease in interest income, partially offset by a $41.2 million decrease in interest expense on a fully taxable equivalent basis. The $49.7 million decrease in interest income was primarily the result of  higher levels of earning assets at lower yields. Although our interest earning assets increased, our average loan balances decreased by $1.13 billion while average interest-bearing balances due from banks increased by $1.84 billion. The lower yield on earning assets resulted in a decrease in interest income of approximately $5.9 million, and the change in composition of earning assets at lower yields resulted in a decrease in interest income of approximately $43.8 million.  The lower yield was primarily driven by the decrease in income on loans of $53.6 million, which was partially offset by an increase in income on investment securities of $2.2 million and a $1.7 million increase in income on interest-bearing balances due from banks. The decrease in interest income also reflected a $7.2 million decrease in loan accretion income.  The $41.2 million decrease in interest expense was primarily the result of interest-bearing liabilities repricing in a decreasing interest rate environment, which lowered interest expense by $34.9 million, as well as a $6.3 million decrease in interest expense resulting from a change in the composition of  average interest bearing liabilities. The decrease in interest expense was primarily driven by a $38.2 million decrease in interest expense on deposits and a $1.9 million decrease in interest expense on FHLB borrowed funds.\nOur net interest margin decreased from 4.29% for the year ended December\u00a031, 2019 to 4.06% for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020.  The yield on interest earning assets was 4.70% and 5.45% for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as average interest earning assets increased from $13.26 billion to $14.50 billion. The increase in average earning assets is primarily the result of a $542.5 million increase in average loans receivable, a $506.6 million increase in average interest-bearing balances due from banks and a $187.9 million increase in average investment securities. Average PPP loan balances were $547.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. These loans bear interest at 1.00% plus the accretion of the origination fee. We recognized total interest income of $19.2 million on PPP loans for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020. The PPP loans were dilutive to the net interest margin by 2 basis points for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020. As a result of the significant excess liquidity in the market created by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting government responses, we had an increase of $506.6 million in average interest-bearing cash balances for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020 compared to the year ended December\u00a031, 2019.  This excess liquidity was dilutive to the net interest margin by 17 basis points. For the year ended December\u00a031, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $27.4 million and $35.9 million, respectively, in total net accretion for acquired loans and deposits. The reduction in accretion was dilutive to the net interest margin by 5 basis points. We recognized $2.1 million event interest income for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020 compared to $3.3 million for the year ended December\u00a031, 2019. This was dilutive to the net interest margin by 1 basis point. The rate on interest bearing liabilities was 0.89% and 1.55% for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as average interest-bearing liabilities increased from $10.02 billion to $10.50 billion. The reduction in yield on loans due to the low interest rate on PPP loans, the impact of the excess liquidity, the reduction in accretion income, and the reduction in loan payoff events, reduced the net interest margin by 25 basis points for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020.\n58\nTable of \nContents\nNet interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased $20.1 million, or 3.5%, to $588.6 million for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020, from $568.5 million for the same period in 2019. This increase in net interest income was the result of a $61.4 million decrease in interest expense partially offset by a $41.3 million decrease in interest income.  The $41.3 million decrease in interest income was primarily the result lower yields on our loans. The higher level of earning assets resulted in an increase in interest income of approximately $43.1 million. The $61.4 million decrease in interest expense was primarily the result of our interest-bearing liabilities repricing in a lower interest rate environment. The lower yield on our interest earning assets resulted in an approximately $84.3 million decrease in interest income. The repricing of our interest-bearing liabilities in a lower interest rate environment resulted in an approximately $62.2 million decrease in interest expense. The higher level of our interest-bearing liabilities resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately $797,000.  \nTables 2 and 3 reflect an analysis of net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis for the years ended December\u00a031, 2021, 2020 and 2019, as well as changes in fully taxable equivalent net interest margin for the years 2021 compared to 2020 and 2020 compared to 2019.\nTable 2: Analysis of Net Interest Income\n \nYears Ended December 31,\n2021\n2020\n2019\n(Dollars in thousands)\nInterest income\n$\n625,171\u00a0\n$\n675,962\u00a0\n$\n717,988\u00a0\nFully taxable equivalent adjustment\n7,079\u00a0\n6,015\u00a0\n5,255\u00a0\nInterest income \u2013 fully taxable equivalent\n632,250\u00a0\n681,977\u00a0\n723,243\u00a0\nInterest expense\n52,200\u00a0\n93,407\u00a0\n154,771\u00a0\nNet interest income \u2013 fully taxable equivalent\n$\n580,050\u00a0\n$\n588,570\u00a0\n$\n568,472\u00a0\nYield on earning assets \u2013 fully taxable equivalent\n3.99\u00a0\n%\n4.70\u00a0\n%\n5.45\u00a0\n%\nCost of interest-bearing liabilities\n0.49\u00a0\n0.89\u00a0\n1.55\u00a0\nNet interest spread \u2013 fully taxable equivalent\n3.50\u00a0\n3.81\u00a0\n3.90\u00a0\nNet interest margin \u2013 fully taxable equivalent\n3.66\u00a0\n4.06\u00a0\n4.29\u00a0\nTable 3: Changes in Fully Taxable Equivalent Net Interest Margin\nDecember 31,\n2021 vs. 2020\n2020 vs. 2019\n(In thousands)\n(Decrease) increase in interest income due to change in earning assets\n$\n(43,840)\n$\n43,052\u00a0\n(Decrease) increase in interest income due to change in earning asset yields\n(5,887)\n(84,318)\nDecrease (increase) in interest expense due to change in interest-bearing liabilities\n6,325\u00a0\n(797)\nDecrease in interest expense due to change in  interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities\n34,882\u00a0\n62,161\u00a0\n(Decrease) increase in net interest income\n$\n(8,520)\n$\n20,098\u00a0\nTable 4 shows, for each major category of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the average amount outstanding, the interest income or expense on that amount and the average rate earned or expensed for the years ended December\u00a031, 2021, 2020 and 2019.

The guidance replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss methodology. The measurement of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables and held-to-maturity debt securities. It also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance (loan commitments, standby letters of credits, financial guarantees, and other similar instruments) and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor in accordance with Topic 842 on leases. ASC 326 requires enhanced disclosures related to the significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of a company\u2019s portfolio. In addition, ASC 326 made changes to the accounting for available-for-sale debt securities. One such change is to require credit losses to be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down on available for sale debt securities management does not intend to sell or believes that it is more likely than not, they will be required to sell. \n61\nTable of \nContents\nCredit Loss Expense\n: During the year ended December\u00a031, 2021, the Company did not record a provision for credit losses but did record a $4.8 million negative provision for unfunded commitments\n \nfor a total credit loss benefit of $4.8 million compared to a $112.3 million provision for credit losses and a $17.0 million provision for unfunded commitments for a total credit loss expense of $129.3 million for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020.  The $4.8 million negative provision for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021 was due to a single commercial & industrial loan for which a reserve was no longer considered necessary due to the borrower\u2019s current cash flow position.  The $129.3 million of total credit loss expense for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020 was primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with $9.3 million for the acquisition of LH-Finance on February 29, 2020. The Company\u2019s provisioning model is closely tied to unemployment rate projections which have continued to improve since the fourth quarter of 2020. The Company determined that an additional provision for credit losses was not necessary.  Despite the improvements in the economic and public health outlooks in the United States during 2021, the emergence of the Delta variant during the second quarter and the Omicron variant during the fourth quarter have resulted in significant uncertainty about the future impact of the pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  As a result, the Company determined that a negative provision for credit losses was not appropriate at this time, and the current level of the allowance for credit losses was considered adequate as of December\u00a031, 2021.  Net charge-offs to average total loans decreased to 0.08% for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021 from 0.11% for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020. In addition, non-performing loans to total loans decreased from 0.66% as of December\u00a031, 2020 to 0.51% as of December\u00a031, 2021.\nLoans.\n Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or term as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in the national unemployment rate, gross domestic product, rental vacancy rate, housing price index and national retail sales index. \nAcquired loans\n. In accordance with ASC 326, the Company records both a discount and an allowance for credit losses on acquired loans. This is commonly referred to as \u201cdouble accounting.\u201d \nThe allowance for credit losses is measured based on call report segment as these types of loan exhibit similar risk characteristics. The identified loan segments are as follows:\n\u2022\n1-4 family construction\n\u2022\nAll other construction\n\u2022\n1-4 family revolving home equity lines of credit (\u201cHELOC\u201d) & junior liens\n\u2022\n1-4 family senior liens\n\u2022\nMultifamily\n\u2022\nOwner occupies commercial real estate\n\u2022\nNon-owner occupied commercial real estate\n\u2022\nCommercial & industrial, agricultural, non-depository financial institutions, purchase/carry securities, other \n\u2022\nConsumer auto\n\u2022\nOther consumer\n\u2022\nOther consumer - SPF\nThe allowance for credit losses for each segment is measured through the use of the discounted cash flow method. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually that are considered to be collateral dependent are not included in the collective evaluation. For those loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows, collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. For loans that are not considered to be collateral dependent, an allowance is recorded based on the loss rate for the respective pool within the collective evaluation if a specific reserve is not recorded.\nInvestments \u2013 Available-for-sale\n: The Company evaluates all securities quarterly to determine if any securities in a loss position require a provision for credit losses in accordance with ASC 326, \nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\n. The Company first assesses whether it intends to sell or is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security\u2019s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For securities that do not meet these criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, \n62\nTable of \nContents\nand changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.\nNon-Interest Income\nTotal non-interest income was $137.6\u00a0million in 2021, compared to $111.8\u00a0million in 2020 and $99.5\u00a0million in 2019.

The Company made the strategic decision to demolish and rebuild the branch at its existing location.\n\u2022\nThe $2.9 million increase in data processing expense is primarily related to an increase in software, licensing, software maintenance and internet banking/cash management expenses. \n\u2022\nThe $711,000 in merger and acquisition expense is related to the acquisition of LH-Finance during the first quarter of 2020.\n\u2022\nThe $2.0 million increase in FDIC and state assessment is primarily related to a $2.3 million FDIC small bank assessment credit recorded in the third quarter of 2019. \n\u2022\nThe $897,000 in hurricane expense incurred during the first quarter of 2019 was related to damages from Hurricane Michael which made landfall in Mexico Beach, Florida on October 10, 2018. \n\u2022\nThe $795,000 decrease in legal and accounting fees is primarily due to a reduction in legal and audit fees for the Bank. \n\u2022\nThe $2.1 million decrease in other professional fees is primarily related to a reduction in consulting fees, outsourced special projects and professional fees for the Bank.\n\u2022\nThe $2.9 million decrease in other expenses is primarily due to the decreases in general travel expenses, OREO expenses and other miscellaneous expenses.\nIncome Taxes\nDuring 2021, the Company lowered its marginal tax rate from 26.135% to 25.740%. In an effort to more accurately reflect current state income apportionment and state tax rates, the state tax rate was lowered to 6.0%, lowering the blended rate to 25.74%. Florida and Arkansas were the main drivers in the tax rate reduction. \nDuring 2020, the Company began filing income tax returns in several new states. To account for the slight increase in state income tax expense due to respective state income tax rates, the Company raised its marginal tax rate from 25.819% to 26.135% for 2020.\n66\nTable of \nContents\nDuring 2019, the State of Florida reduced its corporate income tax rate from 5.50% to 4.458% for the tax years January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2021. As a result of this reduction, our income taxes were reduced by $1.0 million. This rate decline lowered the Company\u2019s marginal tax rate from 26.135% to 25.819% for 2019. \nIncome tax expense increased $34.5\u00a0million, or 54.5%, to $97.8\u00a0million for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021, from $63.3\u00a0million for 2020.

The effective tax rates for the years ended December\u00a031, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were 23.45%, 22.78% and 24.92%, respectively. The Company\u2019s marginal tax rate was 25.740%, 26.135% and 25.819% for years ended December\u00a031, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. \nFinancial Condition as of and for the Years Ended December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020\nOur total assets as of December\u00a031, 2021 increased $1.65 billion to $18.05 billion from the $16.40 billion reported as of December\u00a031, 2020. Cash and cash equivalents increased $2.39 billion, or 188.84%. \nThe increase in cash and cash equivalents is due to loan paydowns as well as the significant amount of excess liquidity in the market as a continued result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying governmental response.\n  Our loan portfolio balance decreased $1.38 billion to $9.84\u00a0billion as of December\u00a031, 2021, from $11.22 billion as of December\u00a031, 2020. The decrease in the loan portfolio is due to organic loan decline of $822.2 million and $910.1 million of the Company\u2019s PPP loans being forgiven during 2021, which was partially offset by $347.7 million in new PPP loan originations during 2021\n. \nTotal deposits increased $1.53\u00a0billion to $14.26\u00a0billion as of December\u00a031, 2021 compared to $12.73\u00a0billion as of December\u00a031, 2020, which was due to customers holding higher deposit balances in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the resulting governmental response to the pandemic. Stockholders\u2019 equity increased $160.0\u00a0million to $2.77\u00a0billion as of December\u00a031, 2021, compared to $2.61\u00a0billion as of December\u00a031, 2020. The increase in stockholders\u2019 equity is primarily associated with the $319.0 million in net income, which was partially offset by the $33.7\u00a0million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income, $92.1\u00a0million of shareholder dividends paid and the repurchase of $44.5 million of our common stock during 2021. The improvement in stockholders\u2019 equity was 6.1% for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021 compared to December\u00a031, 2020. \nOur total assets as of December 31, 2020 increased $1.37 billion to $16.40 billion from the $15.03 billion reported as of December 31, 2019. Cash and cash equivalents increased $773.2 million, or 157.6%, due to the significant excess liquidity in the market created by the COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying governmental response. Our loan portfolio balance increased $351.0 million to $11.22 billion as of December 31, 2020, from $10.87 billion as of December 31, 2019. The increase in the loan portfolio is due to the $675.2 million of PPP loans as well as the acquisition of $406.2 million of loans from LH-Finance during the first quarter of 2020, which was offset by $730.4 million in organic loan decline for the year ended December 31, 2020.  Total deposits increased $1.45 billion to $12.73 billion as of December 31, 2020 compared to $11.28 billion as of December 31, 2019, which was due to customers holding higher deposit balances in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the resulting governmental response to the pandemic. Stockholders\u2019 equity increased $94.2 million to $2.61 billion as of December 31, 2020, compared to $2.51 billion as of December 31, 2019.  The increase in stockholders\u2019 equity is primarily associated with the $214.4 million in net income and the $27.9 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, which were partially offset by the $44.0 million impact of the adoption of ASC 326, $87.7 million of shareholder dividends paid and the repurchase of $25.7 million of our common stock during 2020.  The improvement in stockholders\u2019 equity was 3.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019. \nLoan Portfolio\nOur loan portfolio averaged $10.38\u00a0billion and $11.50\u00a0billion during the years ended December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The CARES Act includes an allocation for loans to be issued by financial institutions through the SBA. This program is known as the PPP. PPP loans are forgivable, in whole or in part, so long as employee and compensation levels of the borrower are maintained, and the proceeds are used for payroll and other permitted purposes in accordance with the requirements of the PPP. These loans carry a fixed rate of 1.00% and a term of two years, if not forgiven, in whole or in part. Payments are deferred for the first six months of the loan. The loans are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. The SBA pays the originating bank a processing fee ranging from 1.00% to 5.00%, based on the size of the loan. The PPP/HCEA Act was enacted on April 24, 2020. The PPP/HCEA Act authorizes additional funds under the CARES Act for PPP loans to be issued by financial institutions through the SBA. The CAA was signed into law on December 27, 2020. The CAA also authorizes additional funds under the \n67\nTable of \nContents\nCARES Act for PPP loans to be issued by financial institutions through the SBA with a term of 5 years.  As of December\u00a031, 2021, the Company had $112.8 million of PPP loans.\n \nThis balance consists of $107.9 million in commercial and industrial loans and $4.9 million in other loans. \nDuring 2021, the Company experienced a decline of approximately $1.38 billion in loans.\n \nThe decrease in the loan portfolio is primarily due to $822.2 million in organic loan decline as well as $562.4 million in PPP loan decline. The $822.2 million in organic loan decline included $385.3 million in loan growth for Centennial CFG, while the remaining footprint experienced $1.20 billion in loan decline during 2021. The $562.4 million in PPP loan decline was the result of $910.1 million of PPP loans being forgiven, partially offset by $347.7 million in new PPP loans during 2021.  \nDuring 2020, the Company experienced an increase of approximately $351.0 million in loans compared to 2019. The increase in the loan portfolio is primarily due to the $675.2 million of PPP loans held as of December 31, 2020 as well as the acquisition of $406.2 million of loans from LH-Finance during the first quarter of 2020, which was offset by $730.4 million in organic loan decline for the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the effects of PPP loan originations, Centennial CFG experienced $59.9 million of organic loan decline during the year, while the remaining footprint, excluding the acquisition of LH-Finance, experienced $670.5 million of organic loan decline during 2020.\nThe most significant components of the loan portfolio were commercial real estate, residential real estate, consumer and commercial and industrial loans. These loans are generally secured by residential or commercial real estate or business or personal property. Although these loans are primarily originated within our franchises in Arkansas, Florida, South Alabama and Centennial CFG, the property securing these loans may not physically be located within our market areas of Arkansas, Florida, Alabama and New York. Loans receivable were approximately $3.14 billion, $3.67 billion, $218.8 million, $888.2 million and $1.92 billion as of December\u00a031, 2021 in Arkansas, Florida, Alabama, SPF and Centennial CFG, respectively.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, we had $376.4 million of construction/land development loans which were collateralized by land. This consisted of $38.1 million for raw land and $338.3 million for land with commercial and/or residential lots.\nTable 8 presents our loans receivable balances by category as of December\u00a031, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nTable 8: Loans Receivable\n \nAs of December 31, \n2021\n2020\n(In thousands)\nReal estate:\nCommercial real estate loans:\nNon-farm/non-residential\n$\n3,889,284\u00a0\n$\n4,429,060\u00a0\nConstruction/land development\n1,850,050\u00a0\n1,562,298\u00a0\nAgricultural\n130,674\u00a0\n114,431\u00a0\nResidential real estate loans:\nResidential 1-4 family\n1,274,953\u00a0\n1,536,257\u00a0\nMultifamily residential\n280,837\u00a0\n536,538\u00a0\nTotal real estate\n7,425,798\u00a0\n8,178,584\u00a0\nConsumer\n825,519\u00a0\n864,690\u00a0\nCommercial and industrial\n1,386,747\u00a0\n1,896,442\u00a0\nAgricultural\n43,920\u00a0\n66,869\u00a0\nOther\n154,105\u00a0\n214,136\u00a0\nTotal loans receivable\n$\n9,836,089\u00a0\n$\n11,220,721\u00a0\nCommercial Real Estate Loans\n. We originate non-farm and non-residential loans (primarily secured by commercial real estate), construction/land development loans, and agricultural loans, which are generally secured by real estate located in our market areas. Our commercial mortgage loans are generally collateralized by first liens on real estate and amortized (where defined) over a 15 to 30-year period with balloon payments due at the end of one to five years. These loans are generally underwritten by assessing cash flow (debt service coverage), primary and secondary source of repayment, the \n68\nTable of \nContents\nfinancial strength of any guarantor, the strength of the tenant (if any), the borrower\u2019s liquidity and leverage, management experience, ownership structure, economic conditions and industry specific trends and collateral. Generally, we will loan up to 85% of the value of improved property, 65% of the value of raw land and 75% of the value of land to be acquired and developed. A first lien on the property and assignment of lease is required if the collateral is rental property, with second lien positions considered on a case-by-case basis.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, commercial real estate loans totaled $5.87\u00a0billion\n,\n or\n \n59.7% of loans receivable, as compared to $6.11\u00a0billion, or 54.4% of loans receivable, as of December\u00a031, 2020. Commercial real estate loans originated in our Arkansas, Florida, Alabama, SPF and Centennial CFG markets were $2.06 billion, $2.38 billion, $105.6 million, zero and $1.33 billion at December\u00a031, 2021, respectively. \nResidential Real Estate Loans\n. We originate one to four family, residential mortgage loans generally secured by property located in our primary market areas. Approximately 35.6% and 52.1% of our residential mortgage loans consist of owner occupied 1-4 family properties and non-owner occupied 1-4 family properties (rental), respectively, as of December\u00a031, 2021, with the remaining 12.3% relating to condos and mobile homes. Residential real estate loans generally have a loan-to-value ratio of up to 90%. These loans are underwritten by giving consideration to many factors including the borrower\u2019s ability to pay, stability of employment or source of income, debt-to-income ratio, credit history and loan-to-value ratio. \nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, residential real estate loans totaled $1.56\u00a0billion, or 15.8%, of loans receivable, compared to $2.07\u00a0billion, or 18.5% of loans receivable, as of December\u00a031, 2020. Residential real estate loans originated in our franchises in our Arkansas, Florida, Alabama, SPF and Centennial CFG markets were $483.2 million, $858.9 million, $60.6 million, zero and $153.1 million at December\u00a031, 2021, respectively. \nConsumer Loans\n. Our consumer loans are composed of secured and unsecured loans originated by our bank, the primary portion of which consists of loans to finance USCG registered high-end sail and power boats as a result of our acquisition of SPF on June 30, 2018 as well as our acquisition of LH-Finance on February 29, 2020. The performance of consumer loans will be affected by the local and regional economies as well as the rates of personal bankruptcies, job loss, divorce and other individual-specific characteristics.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, consumer loans totaled $825.5\u00a0million, or 8.4% of loans receivable, compared to $864.7\u00a0million, or 7.7% of loans receivable, as of December\u00a031, 2020. Consumer loans originated in our Arkansas, Florida, Alabama, SPF and Centennial CFG markets were $20.0 million, $8.5 million, $763,000, $796.3 million and zero at December\u00a031, 2021, respectively. \nCommercial and Industrial Loans\n. Commercial and industrial loans are made for a variety of business purposes, including working capital, inventory, equipment and capital expansion. The terms for commercial loans are generally one to seven years. Commercial loan applications must be supported by current financial information on the borrower and, where appropriate, by adequate collateral. Commercial loans are generally underwritten by addressing cash flow (debt service coverage), primary and secondary sources of repayment, the financial strength of any guarantor, the borrower\u2019s liquidity and leverage, management experience, ownership structure, economic conditions and industry specific trends and collateral. The loan to value ratio depends on the type of collateral. Generally speaking, accounts receivable are financed at between 50% and 80% of accounts receivable less than 60 days past due. Inventory financing will range between 50% and 80% (with no work in process) depending on the borrower and nature of inventory. We require a first lien position for those loans.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, commercial and industrial loans totaled $1.39\u00a0billion, or\n \n14.1% of loans receivable, which compared to $1.90\u00a0billion, or 16.9% of loans receivable, as of December\u00a031, 2020. Commercial and industrial loans originated in our Arkansas, Florida, Alabama, SPF and Centennial CFG markets were $453.4 million, $362.3 million, $42.2 million, $91.9 million and $437.0 million at December\u00a031, 2021, respectively. \nAgricultural Loans\n. Agricultural loans include loans for financing agricultural production, including loans to businesses or individuals engaged in the production of timber, poultry, livestock or crops and are not categorized as part of real estate loans. Our agricultural loans are generally secured by farm machinery, livestock, crops, vehicles or other agricultural-related collateral. A portion of our portfolio of agricultural loans is comprised of loans to individuals which would normally be characterized as consumer loans except for the fact that the individual borrowers are primarily engaged in the production of timber, poultry, livestock or crops.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, agricultural loans totaled\n \n$43.9\u00a0million, or 0.4% of loans receivable, compared to the\n \n$66.9\u00a0million\n,\n or 0.6% of loans receivable as of December\u00a031, 2020. Agricultural loans originated in our Arkansas, Florida, \n69\nTable of \nContents\nAlabama, SPF and Centennial CFG markets were $43.6 million, $330,000, zero, zero and zero at December\u00a031, 2021, respectively. \nTable 9 presents the distribution of the maturity of our total loans as of December\u00a031, 2021. The table also presents the portion of our loans that have fixed interest rates and interest rates that fluctuate over the life of the loans based on changes in the interest rate environment. \nThe loans acquired during our acquisitions accrete interest income through accretion of the difference between the carrying amount of the loans and the expected cash flows.

Loans that are 90 days past due are placed on non-accrual status unless they are adequately secured and there is reasonable assurance of full collection of both principal and interest. Our management closely monitors all loans that are contractually 90 days past due, treated as \u201cspecial mention\u201d or otherwise classified or on non-accrual status.\nThe Company adopted ASC 326 using the prospective transition approach for financial assets purchased with credit deterioration that were previously classified as PCI and accounted for under ASC 310-30. In 2019, the Company reevaluated its loan pools of purchased loans with deteriorated credit quality. These loans pools related specifically to acquired loans from the Heritage, Liberty, Landmark, Bay Cities, Bank of Commerce, Premier Bank, Stonegate and Shore Premier Finance acquisitions. At acquisition, a portion of these loans were recorded as purchased credit impaired loans on a pool by pool basis. Through the reevaluation of these loan pools, management determined that estimated losses for purchase credit impaired loans should be processed against the credit mark of the applicable pools. The remaining non-accretable mark was then moved to accretable mark to be recognized over the remaining weighted average life of the loan pools. The projected losses for these loans were less than the total credit mark. As such, the remaining $107.6 million of loans in these pools along with the $29.3 million in accretable yield were deemed to be immaterial and were reclassified out of the purchased credit impaired loans category. As of December 31, 2019, the Company no longer held any purchased loans with deteriorated credit quality. Therefore, the Company did not have any PCI loans upon adoption of ASC 326 as of January 1, 2020. \nThe Company has purchased loans, some of which have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination. PCD loans are recorded at the amount paid. An allowance for credit losses is determined using the same methodology as other loans. The initial allowance for credit losses determined on a collective basis is allocated to individual loans. The sum of the loan\u2019s purchase price and allowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a noncredit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded through provision expense.\nTable 10 sets forth information with respect to our non-performing assets as of December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020. As of these dates, all non-performing restructured loans are included in non-accrual loans.\nTable 10: Non-performing Assets\n \nAs of December 31, \n2021\n2020\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNon-accrual loans\n$\n47,158\u00a0\n$\n64,528\u00a0\nLoans past due 90 days or more (principal or interest  payments)\n3,035\u00a0\n9,610\u00a0\nTotal non-performing loans\n50,193\u00a0\n74,138\u00a0\nOther non-performing assets\nForeclosed assets held for sale, net\n1,630\u00a0\n4,420\u00a0\nOther non-performing assets\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\nTotal other non-performing assets\n1,630\u00a0\n4,420\u00a0\nTotal non-performing assets\n$\n51,823\u00a0\n$\n78,558\u00a0\nAllowance for credit losses to non-accrual loans\n501.96\u00a0\n%\n380.41\u00a0\n%\nAllowance for credit losses to non-performing loans\n471.61\u00a0\n331.10\u00a0\nNon-accrual loans to total loans\n0.48\u00a0\n0.58\u00a0\nNon-performing loans to total loans\n0.51\u00a0\n0.66\u00a0\nNon-performing assets to total assets\n0.29\u00a0\n0.48\u00a0\n71\nTable of \nContents\nOur non-performing loans are comprised of non-accrual loans and accruing loans that are contractually past due 90 days. Our bank subsidiary recognizes income principally on the accrual basis of accounting. When loans are classified as non-accrual, the accrued interest is charged off and no further interest is accrued, unless the credit characteristics of the loan improve. If a loan is determined by management to be uncollectible, the portion of the loan determined to be uncollectible is then charged to the allowance for credit losses. \nTotal non-performing loans were $50.2 million as of December\u00a031, 2021, compared to $74.1 million as of December\u00a031, 2020, for a decrease of $23.9 million. The $23.9 million decrease in non-performing loans is the result of a $10.2 million decrease in non-performing loans in our Arkansas market, a $16.3 million decrease in non-performing loans in our Florida market, a $60,000 decrease in non-performing loans in our Alabama market, a $2.1 million decrease in non-performing loans attributable to our SPF market, partially offset by a $4.7 million increase in non-performing loans in our Centennial CFG market. Non-performing loans, at December\u00a031, 2021, were $13.9 million, $26.8 million, $470,000, $1.5 million and $7.5 million in the Arkansas, Florida, Alabama, SPF and Centennial CFG markets, respectively. \nThe $7.5 million balance of non-accrual loans for our Centennial CFG market \nconsists of two loans that are assessed for Credit risk by the Federal Reserve under the Shared National Credit Program. The decision to place these loans on non-accrual status was made by the Federal Reserve and not the Company. The loans that make up the total balance are still current on both principal and interest. However, all interest payments are currently being applied to the principal balance. Because the Federal Reserve required us to place these loans on non-accrual status, we have reversed any interest that had accrued subsequent to the non-accrual date designated by the Federal Reserve.\nDuring the year ended December\u00a031, 2021, the Company did not record a provision for credit losses but did record a $4.8 million negative provision for unfunded commitments compared to a $112.3 million provision for credit losses and a $17.0 million provision for unfunded commitments for a total credit loss expense of $129.3 million for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020. The $4.8 million negative provision for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021 was due to a single commercial & industrial loan for which a reserve was no longer considered necessary due to the borrower\u2019s current cash flow position. The $129.3 million of total credit loss expense for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020 was primarily due to the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, with $9.3 million as a result of the acquisition of LH-Finance on February 29, 2020. The Company\u2019s provisioning model is closely tied to unemployment rate projections which have continued to improve since the fourth quarter of 2020. The Company determined that an additional provision for credit losses was not necessary. Despite the improvements in the economic and public health outlooks in the United States during 2021, the emergence of the Delta variant during the second quarter and the Omicron variant during the fourth quarter have resulted in significant uncertainty about the future impact of the pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial condition. As a result, the Company determined that a negative provision for credit losses was not appropriate at this time, and the current level of the allowance for credit losses was considered adequate as of December 31, 2021. \nTroubled debt restructurings (\u201cTDRs\u201d) generally occur when a borrower is experiencing, or is expected to experience, financial difficulties in the near term. As a result, we will work with the borrower to prevent further difficulties, and ultimately to improve the likelihood of recovery on the loan. In those circumstances it may be beneficial to restructure the terms of a loan and work with the borrower for the benefit of both parties, versus forcing the property into foreclosure and having to dispose of it in an unfavorable and depressed real estate market. When we have modified the terms of a loan, we usually either reduce the monthly payment and/or interest rate for generally about three to twelve months. For our TDRs that accrue interest at the time the loan is restructured, it would be a rare exception to have charged-off any portion of the loan. As of December\u00a031, 2021, we had $6.5 million of restructured loans that are in compliance with the modified terms and are not reported as past due or non-accrual in Table 10. Our Florida market contains $3.8 million and our Arkansas market contains $2.7 million of these restructured loans.\nA loan modification that might not otherwise be considered may be granted resulting in classification as a TDR. These loans can involve loans remaining on non-accrual, moving to non-accrual, or continuing on an accrual status, depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower. Generally, a non-accrual loan that is restructured remains on non-accrual for a period of six months to demonstrate that the borrower can meet the restructured terms. However, performance prior to the restructuring, or significant events that coincide with the restructuring, are considered in assessing whether the borrower can pay under the new terms and may result in the loan being returned to an accrual status after a shorter performance period. If the borrower\u2019s ability to meet the revised payment schedule is not reasonably assured, the loan will remain in a non-accrual status.\n72\nTable of \nContents\nSection 4013 of the CARES Act enacted in March 2020 provides financial institutions optional temporary relief from the TDR classification requirements for certain COVID-19 related loan modifications. Specifically, financial institutions may elect to suspend TDR classification for certain loan modifications related to COVID-19 made between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of December 31, 2020 or 60 days after termination of the President\u2019s national emergency declaration for COVID-19. Further, financial institutions do not need to determine impairment associated with certain loan concessions that would otherwise have been required for TDRs (e.g., interest rate concessions, payment deferrals, or loan extensions). On April 7, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued an interagency statement clarifying the relationship between the Section 4013 of the CARES Act and previous guidance issued by the agencies on March 22, 2020. This interagency statement encourages financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their payment obligations because of COVID-19 and states that the agencies view loan modification programs as positive actions that can mitigate adverse effects on borrowers due to COVID-19. The Company relied on Section 4013 of the CARES Act in accounting for loan modifications during the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December\u00a031, 2021, our loan deferrals decreased to $190.7\u00a0million on 26 loans from the December 31, 2020 balance of $330.7 million on 56 loans. All of the customers currently on deferment chose principal deferment only and now have returned to paying interest monthly. The hospitality sector has been most negatively impacted by COVID-19 and represents approximately 76% of the deferment balance as of December\u00a031, 2021.\nThe majority of the Bank\u2019s loan modifications relates to commercial lending and involves reducing the interest rate, changing from a principal and interest payment to interest-only, a lengthening of the amortization period, or a combination of some or all of the three. In addition, it is common for the Bank to seek additional collateral or guarantor support when modifying a loan. At December\u00a031, 2021, the amount of TDRs was $7.5\u00a0million, a decrease of 38.9% from $12.3\u00a0million at December\u00a031, 2020. As of December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, 85.7% and 87.1%, respectively, of all restructured loans were performing to the terms of the restructure. \nTotal foreclosed assets held for sale were $1.6\u00a0million as of December\u00a031, 2021, compared to $4.4\u00a0million as of December\u00a031, 2020 for a decrease of $2.8\u00a0million. The foreclosed assets held for sale as of December\u00a031, 2021 are comprised of approximately $500,000 of assets located in Arkansas and $1.1 million of assets located in Florida and zero from Alabama, SPF and Centennial CFG. \nTable 11 shows the summary of foreclosed assets held for sale as of December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020.\nTable 11: Total Foreclosed Assets Held for Sale\n \nDecember 31\n2021\n2020\n(In thousands)\nCommercial real estate loans\nNon-farm/non-residential\n$\n536\u00a0\n$\n438\u00a0\nConstruction/land development\n834\u00a0\n3,189\u00a0\nAgricultural\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\nResidential real estate loans\nResidential 1-4 family\n260\u00a0\n793\u00a0\nMultifamily residential\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\nTotal foreclosed assets held for sale\n$\n1,630\u00a0\n$\n4,420\u00a0\nA loan is considered impaired when it is probable that we will not receive all amounts due according to the contracted terms of the loans. Impaired loans include non-performing loans (loans past due 90 days or more and non-accrual loans), criticized and/or classified loans with a specific allocation, loans categorized as TDRs and certain other loans identified by management that are still performing (loans included in multiple categories are only included once). As of December\u00a031, 2021, average impaired loans were $289.5 million compared to $96.6 million as of December\u00a031, 2020. As of December\u00a031, 2021 impaired loans were $331.5 million compared to $112.7 million as of December\u00a031, 2020. The amortized cost balance for loans with a specific allocation increased from $39.5 million to $284.0 million, and the specific allocation for impaired loans increased by approximately $41.0 million for the period ended December\u00a031, 2021 compared to the period ended December\u00a031, 2020. \nThe increase in collateral-dependent impaired loans was primarily due to the Company changing the valuation method for lodging and assisted living loans to a market price valuation methodology. This involved assigning a 15% discount of par for these impaired loans. \nThe 15% figure was derived based on knowledge \n73\nTable of \nContents\nof current hotel and assisted living offerings in the loan sale market.\n In the event of default, liquidation would be achieved through a loan sale. The Company is continuing to monitor these impaired loans and will adjust the discount as necessary.\n As of December\u00a031, 2021, our Arkansas, Florida, Alabama, SPF and Centennial CFG markets accounted for approximately $179.6 million, $142.4 million, $470,000, $1.5 million and $7.5 million of the impaired loans, respectively.  \nThe Company has purchased loans, some of which have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination. PCD loans are recorded at the amount paid. An allowance for credit losses is determined using the same methodology as other loans. The initial allowance for credit losses determined on a collective basis is allocated to individual loans. The sum of the loan\u2019s purchase price and allowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a noncredit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded through provision expense. The Company held approximately $448,000 and $760,000 in PCD loans as of December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \nPast Due and Non-Accrual Loans\nTable 12 shows the summary non-accrual loans as of December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020:\nTable 12: Total Non-Accrual Loans\nDecember 31\n2021\n2020\n(In thousands)\nReal estate:\nCommercial real estate loans\nNon-farm/non-residential\n$\n11,923\u00a0\n$\n20,947\u00a0\nConstruction/land development\n1,445\u00a0\n1,381\u00a0\nAgricultural\n897\u00a0\n879\u00a0\nResidential real estate loans\nResidential 1-4 family\n16,198\u00a0\n19,334\u00a0\nMultifamily residential\n156\u00a0\n173\u00a0\nTotal real estate\n30,619\u00a0\n42,714\u00a0\nConsumer\n1,648\u00a0\n3,506\u00a0\nCommercial and industrial\n13,875\u00a0\n17,251\u00a0\nAgricultural & other\n1,016\u00a0\n1,057\u00a0\nTotal non-accrual loans\n$\n47,158\u00a0\n$\n64,528\u00a0\nIf the non-accrual loans had been accruing interest in accordance with the original terms of their respective agreements, interest income of approximately $2.4 million for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021, $3.7 million in 2020, and $2.4 million in 2019 would have been recorded.

The guidance replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss methodology. The measurement of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables. It also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance, including loan commitments, standby letters of credits, financial guarantees, and other similar instruments. The Company adopted ASC 326 using the modified retrospective method for loans and off-balance-sheet credit exposures. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2020 are presented under ASC 326 while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP. The Company recorded a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to the allowance for credit losses of $44.0 million, which was recognized through a $32.5 million adjustment to retained earnings, net of tax. This adjustment brought the beginning balance of the allowance for credit losses to $146.1 million as of January 1, 2020. In addition, the Company recorded a $15.5 million reserve on unfunded commitments, as of January 1, 2020, which was recognized through an $11.5 million adjustment to retained earnings, net of tax. \nOverview\n. The allowance for credit losses on loans receivable is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans\u2019 amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. Loans are charged off against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed and expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off. \nThe Company uses the discounted cash flow (\u201cDCF\u201d) method to estimate expected losses for all of Company\u2019s loan pools. These pools are as follows: construction & land development; other commercial real estate; residential real estate; commercial & industrial; and consumer & other. The loan portfolio pools were selected in order to generally align with the loan categories specified in the quarterly call reports required to be filed with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. For each of these loan pools, the Company generates cash flow projections at the instrument level wherein payment expectations are adjusted for estimated prepayment speed, curtailments, time to recovery, probability of default, and loss given default. The modeling of expected prepayment speeds, curtailment rates, and time to recovery are based on historical internal data. The Company uses regression analysis of historical internal and peer data to determine suitable loss drivers to utilize when modeling lifetime probability of default and loss given default. This analysis also determines how expected probability of default and loss given default will react to forecasted levels of the loss drivers.\n75\nTable of \nContents\nFor all DCF models, management has determined that four quarters represents a reasonable and supportable forecast period and reverts to a historical loss rate over four quarters on a straight-line basis. Management leverages economic projections from a reputable and independent third party to inform its loss driver forecasts over the four-quarter forecast period. Other internal and external indicators of economic forecasts are also considered by management when developing the forecast metrics.\nManagement estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or term as well as for changes in environmental conditions, \nsuch as changes in the national unemployment rate, gross domestic product, rental vacancy rate, housing price index and national retail sales index.\nThe allowance for credit losses is measured based on call report segment as these types of loan exhibit similar risk characteristics. The identified loan segments are as follows:\n\u2022\n1-4 family construction\n\u2022\nAll other construction\n\u2022\n1-4 family revolving home equity lines of credit (\u201cHELOC\u201d) & junior liens\n\u2022\n1-4 family senior liens\n\u2022\nMultifamily\n\u2022\nOwner occupies commercial real estate\n\u2022\nNon-owner occupied commercial real estate\n\u2022\nCommercial & industrial, agricultural, non-depository financial institutions, purchase/carry securities, other \n\u2022\nConsumer auto\n\u2022\nOther consumer\n\u2022\nOther consumer - SPF\nThe combination of adjustments for credit expectations (default and loss) and time expectations prepayment, curtailment, and time to recovery) produces an expected cash flow stream at the instrument level. Instrument effective yield is calculated, net of the impacts of prepayment assumptions, and the instrument expected cash flows are then discounted at that effective yield to produce an instrument-level net present value of expected cash flows (\u201cNPV\u201d). An allowance for credit loss is established for the difference between the instrument\u2019s NPV and amortized cost basis. \nThe allowance for credit losses for each segment is measured through the use of the discounted cash flow method. Loans evaluated individually that are considered to be collateral dependent are not included in the collective evaluation. For those loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows, collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. For loans that are not considered to be collateral dependent, an allowance is recorded based on the loss rate for the respective pool within the collective evaluation if a specific reserve is not recorded.\nExpected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals, and modifications unless either of the following applies: \n\u2022\nManagement has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date that troubled debt restructuring will be executed with an individual borrower.\n\u2022\nThe extension or renewal options are included in the original or modified contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally cancellable by the Company.\nManagement qualitatively adjusts model results for risk factors that are not considered within our modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools. These Q-Factors and other qualitative adjustments may increase or decrease management's estimate of expected credit losses by a calculated percentage or amount based upon the estimated level of risk. The various risks that may be considered in making Q-Factor and other qualitative adjustments include, among other things, the impact of (i) changes in lending policies, procedures and strategies; (ii) changes in nature and volume of the portfolio; (iii) staff experience; (iv) changes in volume and trends in classified loans, delinquencies and nonaccruals; (v) concentration risk; (vi) trends in underlying collateral values; (vii) external factors such as competition, legal and regulatory environment; (viii) changes in the quality of the loan review system and (ix) economic conditions.\n76\nTable of \nContents\nLoans considered impaired, according to ASC 326, are loans for which, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The aggregate amount of impairment of loans is utilized in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and amount of provisions thereto. Losses on impaired loans are charged against the allowance for credit losses when in the process of collection, it appears likely that such losses will be realized. The accrual of interest on impaired loans is discontinued when, in management\u2019s opinion the collection of interest is doubtful or generally when loans are 90 days or more past due. When accrual of interest is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received in excess of principal due. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\nLoans are placed on non-accrual status when management believes that the borrower\u2019s financial condition, after giving consideration to economic and business conditions and collection efforts, is such that collection of interest is doubtful, or generally when loans are 90 days or more past due. Loans are charged against the allowance for credit losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. Accrued interest related to non-accrual loans is generally charged against the allowance for credit losses when accrued in prior years and reversed from interest income if accrued in the current year. Interest income on non-accrual loans may be recognized to the extent cash payments are received, although the majority of payments received are usually applied to principal. Non-accrual loans are generally returned to accrual status when principal and interest payments are less than 90 days past due, the customer has made required payments for at least six months, and we reasonably expect to collect all principal and interest.\nAcquisition Accounting and Acquired Loans.\n We account for our acquisitions under FASB ASC Topic 805, \nBusiness Combinations,\n which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting. All identifiable assets acquired, including loans, are recorded at fair value. In accordance with ASC 326, the Company records both a discount and an allowance for credit losses on acquired loans. All purchased loans are recorded at fair value in accordance with the fair value methodology prescribed in FASB ASC Topic 820, \nFair Value Measurements.\n The fair value estimates associated with the loans include estimates related to expected prepayments and the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal, interest and other cash flows. \nThe Company has purchased loans, some of which have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination. PCD loans are recorded at the amount paid. An allowance for credit losses is determined using the same methodology as other loans. The initial allowance for credit losses determined on a collective basis is allocated to individual loans. The sum of the loan\u2019s purchase price and allowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a noncredit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded through provision for credit loss. \nAllowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures.\n The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. \nSpecific Allocations.\n As a general rule, if a specific allocation is warranted, it is the result of an analysis of a previously classified credit or relationship. Typically, when it becomes evident through the payment history or a financial statement review that a loan or relationship is no longer supported by the cash flows of the asset and/or borrower and has become collateral dependent, we will use appraisals or other collateral analysis to determine if collateral impairment has occurred. The amount or likelihood of loss on this credit may not yet be evident, so a charge-off would not be prudent. However, if the analysis indicates that an impairment has occurred, then a specific allocation will be determined for this loan. If our existing appraisal is outdated or the collateral has been subject to significant market changes, we will obtain a new appraisal for this impairment analysis. The majority of our impaired loans are collateral dependent at the present time, so third-party appraisals were used to determine the necessary impairment for these loans. Cash flow available to service debt was used for the other impaired loans. This analysis is performed each quarter in connection with the preparation of the analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, and if necessary, adjustments are made to the specific allocation provided for a particular loan.\n77\nTable of \nContents\nFor collateral dependent loans, we do not consider an appraisal outdated simply due to the passage of time. However, if an appraisal is older than 13 months and if market or other conditions have deteriorated and we believe that the current market value of the property is not within approximately 20% of the appraised value, we will consider the appraisal outdated and order either a new appraisal or an internal validation report for the impairment analysis. The recognition of any provision or related charge-off on a collateral dependent loan is either through annual credit analysis or, many times, when the relationship becomes delinquent. If the borrower is not current, we will update our credit and cash flow analysis to determine the borrower's repayment ability. If we determine this ability does not exist and it appears that the collection of the entire principal and interest is not likely, then the loan could be placed on non-accrual status. In any case, loans are classified as non-accrual no later than 105 days past due. If the loan requires a quarterly impairment analysis, this analysis is completed in conjunction with the completion of the analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. Any exposure identified through the impairment analysis is shown as a specific reserve on the individual impairment. If it is determined that a new appraisal or internal validation report is required, it is ordered and will be taken into consideration during completion of the next impairment analysis.\nIn estimating the net realizable value of the collateral, management may deem it appropriate to discount the appraisal based on the applicable circumstances. In such case, the amount charged off may result in loan principal outstanding being below fair value as presented in the appraisal.\nBetween the receipt of the original appraisal and the updated appraisal, we monitor the loan's repayment history. If the loan is $3.0 million or greater or the total loan relationship is $5.0 million or greater, our policy requires an annual credit review. Our policy requires financial statements from the borrowers and guarantors at least annually. In addition, we calculate the global repayment ability of the borrower/guarantors at least annually.\nAs a general rule, when it becomes evident that the full principal and accrued interest of a loan may not be collected, or by law at 105 days past due, we will reflect that loan as non-performing. It will remain non-performing until it performs in a manner that it is reasonable to expect that we will collect the full principal and accrued interest. \nWhen the amount or likelihood of a loss on a loan has been determined, a charge-off should be taken in the period it is determined. If a partial charge-off occurs, the quarterly impairment analysis will determine if the loan is still impaired, and thus continues to require a specific allocation.\nThe Company had $331.5 million and $112.7 million in collateral-dependent impaired loans for the periods ended \nDecember\u00a031, 2021\n and 2020, respectively.\n \nThe increase in collateral-dependent impaired loans was due to the Company changing the valuation method for lodging and assisted living loans to a market price valuation methodology. This involved assigning a 15% discount of par for these impaired loans. \nThe 15% figure was derived based on knowledge of current hotel and assisted living offerings in the loan sale market.\n In the event of default, liquidation would be achieved through a loan sale. The Company is continuing to monitor these impaired loans and will adjust the discount as necessary.\nLoans Collectively Evaluated for Impairment. \nLoans receivable collectively evaluated for impairment decreased by approximately $1.22 billion from $10.76 billion at December\u00a031, 2020 to $9.54 billion at December\u00a031, 2021. The percentage of the allowance for credit losses allocated to loans receivable collectively evaluated for impairment to the total loans collectively evaluated for impairment decreased from 2.18% at December\u00a031, 2020 to 1.94% at December\u00a031, 2021. \nCharge-offs and Recoveries.\n Total charge-offs decreased to $11.7 million for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021, compared to $14.5 million for the year ended December\u00a031, 2020. Total recoveries increased to $2.9 million for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021, compared to $2.1 million for the same period in 2020. \nNet loans charged off for the years ended December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020 were $8.8 million and $12.4 million, respectively. For the years ended December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, approximately $3.1 million and $4.4 million, respectively, of the net charge-offs were from our Arkansas market. For the years ended December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, approximately $5.3 million and $7.9 million, respectively, of the net charge-offs were from our Florida market.  Approximately $17,000 and $11,000 related to net charge-offs for the years ended December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, respectively, on loans in our Alabama market. For the years ended December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, approximately $401,000 and $80,000 of the net charge-offs were from our SPF market. There have been zero charge-offs for Centennial CFG since the franchise was formed in 2015.\n78\nTable of \nContents\nWhile the 2021 charge-offs and recoveries consisted of many relationships, there were two individual relationships consisting of charge-offs greater than $1.0 million. The first was a $3.8 million charge-off for a commercial and industrial loan in our Florida market. The second was a $1.9 million charge-off for a commercial and industrial loan in our Arkansas market. For the year ended December\u00a031, 2020, there were two individual relationships consisting of charge-offs greater than $1.0 million. The first was a $1.9 million charge-off for a commercial and industrial loan that had been acquired in the Stonegate acquisition. The second was a $2.5 million charge-off for a commercial and industrial loan in our Florida market.\nWe have not charged off an amount less than what was determined to be the fair value of the collateral as presented in the appraisal, less estimated costs to sell (for collateral dependent loans), for any period presented. Loans partially charged-off are placed on non-accrual status until it is proven that the borrower's repayment ability with respect to the remaining principal balance can be reasonably assured.

Securities within the portfolio are classified as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading based on the intent and objective of the investment and the ability to hold to maturity. Fair values of securities are based on quoted market prices where available. If quoted market prices are not available, estimated fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable securities. The estimated effective duration of our securities portfolio was 3.7 years as of December\u00a031, 2021.\nSecurities available-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders\u2019 equity as other comprehensive income. Securities that are held as available-for-sale are used as a part of our asset/liability management strategy. Securities that may be sold in response to interest rate changes, changes in prepayment risk, the need to increase regulatory capital, and other similar factors are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities were $3.12\u00a0billion and $2.47\u00a0billion as of December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, $1.54\u00a0billion, or 49.3%, of our available-for-sale securities were invested in mortgage-backed securities, compared to $1.18\u00a0billion, or 47.6%, of our available-for-sale securities as of December\u00a031, 2020. To reduce our income tax burden, $997.0\u00a0million, or 32.0%, of our available-for-sale securities portfolio as of December\u00a031, 2021, was primarily invested in tax-exempt obligations of state and political subdivisions, compared to $927.9\u00a0million, or 37.5%, of our available-for-sale securities as of December\u00a031, 2020. We had $433.0\u00a0million, or 13.9%, invested in obligations of U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises as of December\u00a031, 2021, compared to $327.0\u00a0million, or 13.2%, of our available-for-sale securities as of December\u00a031, 2020. Also, we had approximately $151.9\u00a0million, or 4.9%, invested in other securities as of December\u00a031, 2021, compared to $41.0\u00a0million, or 1.7%, of our available-for-sale securities as of December\u00a031, 2020.\n81\nTable of \nContents\nThe Company evaluates all securities quarterly to determine if any securities in a loss position require a provision for credit losses in accordance with ASC 326, \nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\n. The Company first assesses whether it intends to sell or is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security\u2019s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For securities that do not meet this criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. \nChanges in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. At \nDecember\u00a031, 2021\n, the Company determined that the allowance for credit losses of $842,000, resulting from economic uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic, was adequate for the investment portfolio. No additional provision for credit losses was considered necessary for the portfolio.\nTable 16 presents the carrying value and fair value of investment securities as of December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020.\nTable 16: Investment Securities\nDecember 31, 2021\nDecember 31, 2020\nAmortized\nCost\nGross\nUnrealized\nGains\nGross \nUnrealized \nLosses\nFair Value\nAmortized\nCost\nGross\nUnrealized\nGains\nGross \nUnrealized \nLosses\nFair Value\n(In thousands)\nAvailable-for-sale\nU.S. government-sponsored enterprises\n$\n433,829\u00a0\n$\n2,375\u00a0\n$\n(3,225)\n$\n432,979\u00a0\n$\n325,860\u00a0\n$\n2,338\u00a0\n$\n(1,207)\n$\n326,991\u00a0\nResidential mortgage-backed securities\n1,175,185\u00a0\n4,085\u00a0\n(18,551)\n1,160,719\u00a0\n703,138\u00a0\n10,607\u00a0\n(688)\n713,057\u00a0\nCommercial mortgage-backed securities\n372,702\u00a0\n6,521\u00a0\n(1,968)\n377,255\u00a0\n446,964\u00a0\n18,048\u00a0\n(126)\n464,886\u00a0\nState and political subdivisions\n973,318\u00a0\n26,296\u00a0\n(2,636)\n996,978\u00a0\n898,174\u00a0\n31,173\u00a0\n(1,454)\n927,893\u00a0\nOther securities\n151,449\u00a0\n1,781\u00a0\n(1,354)\n151,876\u00a0\n40,755\u00a0\n434\u00a0\n(235)\n40,954\u00a0\nTotal\n$\n3,106,483\u00a0\n$\n41,058\u00a0\n$\n(27,734)\n$\n3,119,807\u00a0\n$\n2,414,891\u00a0\n$\n62,600\u00a0\n$\n(3,710)\n$\n2,473,781\u00a0\n82\nTable of \nContents\nTable 17 reflects the amortized cost and estimated fair value of debt securities as of December\u00a031, 2021, by contractual maturity as well as the weighted-average yields (for tax-exempt obligations on a fully taxable equivalent basis) of those securities by contractual maturity.

Tax-exempt obligations have been computed on a tax-equivalent basis. Taxable-equivalent adjustments are the result of increasing income from tax-free investments by an amount equal to the taxes that would be paid if the income were fully taxable, thus making tax-exempt yields comparable to taxable asset yields. Taxable equivalent adjustments were based upon a 25.74% income tax rate. In 2021, $19.6 million of interest income on debt securities was excluded from Federal taxation, and $6.1 million was excluded from state taxation.  \nDeposits\nOur deposits averaged $13.73\u00a0billion for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021 and $12.44\u00a0billion for 2020. Total deposits increased $1.53\u00a0billion, or 12.1%, to $14.26\u00a0billion as of December\u00a031, 2021, from $12.73\u00a0billion as of December\u00a031, 2020. Uninsured deposits including related interest accrued and unpaid were $5.66 billion as of December\u00a031, 2021 compared to $6.07 billion as of December\u00a031, 2020. Deposits are our primary source of funds. We offer a variety of products designed to attract and retain deposit customers. Those products consist of checking accounts, regular savings deposits, NOW accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. Deposits are gathered from individuals, partnerships and corporations in our market areas. In addition, we obtain deposits from state and local entities and, to a lesser extent, U.S. Government and other depository institutions. \n83\nTable of \nContents\nOur policy also permits the acceptance of brokered deposits. From time to time, when appropriate in order to fund strong loan demand, we accept brokered time deposits, generally in denominations of less than $250,000, from a regional brokerage firm, and other national brokerage networks. We also participate in the One-Way Buy Insured Cash Sweep (\u201cICS\u201d) service and similar services, which provide for one-way buy transactions among banks for the purpose of purchasing cost-effective floating-rate funding without collateralization or stock purchase requirements. Management believes these sources represent a reliable and cost-efficient alternative funding source for the Company. However, to the extent that our condition or reputation deteriorates, or to the extent that there are significant changes in market interest rates which we do not elect to match, we may experience an outflow of brokered deposits. In that event we would be required to obtain alternate sources for funding.\nTable 18 reflects the classification of the brokered deposits as of December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020.\nTable 18: Brokered Deposits\nDecember 31, 2021\nDecember 31, 2020\n(In thousands)\nTime Deposits\n$\n\u2014\u00a0\n$\n10,000\u00a0\nInsured Cash Sweep and Other Transaction Accounts\n625,704\u00a0\n625,681\u00a0\nTotal Brokered Deposits\n$\n625,704\u00a0\n$\n635,681\u00a0\nThe interest rates paid are competitively priced for each particular deposit product and structured to meet our funding requirements. We will continue to manage interest expense through deposit pricing. We may allow higher rate deposits to run off during periods of limited loan demand. We believe that additional funds can be attracted, and deposit growth can be realized through deposit pricing if we experience increased loan demand or other liquidity needs. \nThe Federal Reserve Board sets various benchmark rates, including the Federal Funds rate, and thereby influences the general market rates of interest, including the deposit and loan rates offered by financial institutions. The Federal Reserve lowered the target rate three times during 2019. First, the target rate was lowered to 2.00% to 2.25% on July 31, 2019; second, the rate was lowered on September 18, 2019 to 1.75% to 2.00%; and third, the rate was lowered on October 30, 2019 to 1.50% to 1.75%. The Federal Reserve lowered the target rate two times in 2020. First, the target rate was lowered to 1.00% to 1.25% on March 3, 2020; second, the rate was lowered to 0.00% to 0.25% on March 15, 2020. The target rate is currently at 0.00% to 0.25% as of December\u00a031, 2021.\nTable 19 reflects the classification of the average deposits and the average rate paid on each deposit category which is in excess of 10 percent of average total deposits, for the years ended December\u00a031, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\nTable 19: Average Deposit Balances and Rates\nYears Ended December 31, \n2021\n2020\n2019\nAverage\nAmount\nAverage\nRate Paid\nAverage\nAmount\nAverage\nRate Paid\nAverage\nAmount\nAverage\nRate Paid\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNon-interest-bearing transaction accounts\n$\n3,924,341\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n%\n$\n2,998,560\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n%\n$\n2,489,254\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n%\nInterest-bearing transaction accounts\n7,846,618\u00a0\n0.20\u00a0\n6,978,839\u00a0\n0.50\u00a0\n6,042,974\u00a0\n1.25\u00a0\nSavings deposits\n869,386\u00a0\n0.06\u00a0\n707,782\u00a0\n0.13\u00a0\n631,519\u00a0\n0.26\u00a0\nTime deposits:\n$100,000 or more\n728,845\u00a0\n1.00\u00a0\n1,346,063\u00a0\n1.70\u00a0\n1,513,510\u00a0\n2.07\u00a0\nOther time deposits\n359,030\u00a0\n0.47\u00a0\n410,075\u00a0\n1.02\u00a0\n458,530\u00a0\n1.22\u00a0\nTotal\n$\n13,728,220\u00a0\n0.18\u00a0\n%\n$\n12,441,319\u00a0\n0.51\u00a0\n%\n$\n11,135,787\u00a0\n1.02\u00a0\n%\n84\nTable of \nContents\nTable 20 presents our maturities of time deposits as of December\u00a031, 2021.\nTable 20: Maturities of Time Deposits\nAs of December 31, 2021\n2021\nInsured\nUninsured\nTotal\n(Dollars in thousands)\nMaturing\nThree months or less\n$\n175,573\u00a0\n$\n90,140\u00a0\n$\n265,713\u00a0\nOver three months to six months\n111,178\u00a0\n55,090\u00a0\n166,268\u00a0\nOver six months to 12 months\n174,136\u00a0\n95,801\u00a0\n269,937\u00a0\nOver 12 months\n108,691\u00a0\n70,278\u00a0\n178,969\u00a0\nTotal\n$\n569,578\u00a0\n$\n311,309\u00a0\n$\n880,887\u00a0\nSecurities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase\nWe enter into short-term purchases of securities under agreements to resell (resale agreements) and sales of securities under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) of substantially identical securities.

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased $28.0\u00a0million, or 16.6%, from $168.9\u00a0million as of December\u00a031, 2020 to $140.9\u00a0million as of December\u00a031, 2021.\nFHLB and Other Borrowed Funds\nThe Company\u2019s FHLB borrowed funds, which are secured by our loan portfolio, were $400.0 million at both December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020. The Company had no other borrowed funds as of December\u00a031, 2021 or December\u00a031, 2020. At December\u00a031, 2021 and December\u00a031, 2020, the entire $400.0 million balance was classified as long term advances. The FHLB advances mature in 2033 with fixed interest rates ranging from  1.76% to 2.26% and are secured by loans and investments securities. Expected maturities could differ from contractual maturities because the FHLB has have the right to call or the Company has the right to prepay certain obligations. \nSubordinated Debentures\nSubordinated debentures, which consist of subordinated debt securities and guaranteed payments on trust preferred securities, were $371.1\u00a0million and $370.3\u00a0million as of December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \nThe trust preferred securities are tax-advantaged issues that qualify for Tier 1 capital treatment subject to certain limitations. Distributions on these securities are included in interest expense. Each of the trusts is a statutory business trust organized for the sole purpose of issuing trust securities and investing the proceeds in our subordinated debentures, the sole asset of each trust. The trust preferred securities of each trust represent preferred beneficial interests in the assets of the respective trusts and are subject to mandatory redemption upon payment of the subordinated debentures held by the trust. We wholly own the common securities of each trust. Each trust\u2019s ability to pay amounts due on the trust preferred securities is solely dependent upon our making payment on the related subordinated debentures. Our obligations under the subordinated securities and other relevant trust agreements, in aggregate, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by us of each respective trust\u2019s obligations under the trust securities issued by each respective trust.\nOn April 3, 2017, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.625% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2027 (the \u201cNotes\u201d). The net proceeds of the offering, after underwriting discounts and issuance costs, were approximately $297.0 million. The Notes are unsecured, subordinated debt obligations of the Company and will mature on April 15, 2027. The Company may, beginning with the interest payment date of April 15, 2022, and on any interest payment date thereafter, redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of redemption. From and including the date of issuance to, but excluding April 15, 2022, the Notes bear interest at an initial rate of 5.625% per annum. From and including April 15, 2022 to, but excluding the maturity date or earlier redemption, the Notes will bear interest at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR as calculated on each \n85\nTable of \nContents\napplicable date of determination plus a spread of 3.575%; provided, however, that in the event three-month LIBOR is less than zero, then three-month LIBOR shall be deemed to be zero.\nThe Company may also redeem the Notes at any time, including prior to April 15, 2022, at its option, in whole but not in part, if: (i) a change or prospective change in law occurs that could prevent the Company from deducting interest payable on the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes; (ii) a subsequent event occurs that could preclude the Notes from being recognized as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes; or (iii) the Company is required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended; in each case, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the redemption date. The Notes qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes. The Company is currently considering paying off the Notes. \nOn January 18, 2022, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.125% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2032 (the \u201c2022 Notes\u201d). The net proceeds of the offering, after underwriting discounts and issuance costs, were approximately $296.6 million. The 2022 Notes are unsecured, subordinated debt obligations of the Company and will mature on January 30, 2032. From and including the date of issuance to, but excluding January 30, 2027 or the date of earlier redemption, the 2022 Notes will bear interest at an initial rate of 3.125% per annum, payable in arrears on January 30 and July 30 of each year. From and including January 30, 2027 to, but excluding the maturity date or earlier redemption, the 2022 Notes will bear interest at a floating rate equal to a benchmark rate (which is expected to be three-month term SOFR ), plus 182 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears on January 30, April 30, July 30, and October 30 of each year, commencing on April 30, 2027.\nThe Company may, beginning with the interest payment date of January 30, 2027, and on any interest payment date thereafter, redeem the 2022 Notes, in whole or in part, subject to prior approval of the Federal Reserve if then required, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2022 Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of redemption. The Company may also redeem the 2022 Notes at any time, including prior to January 30, 2027, at the Company\u2019s option, in whole but not in part, subject to prior approval of the Federal Reserve if then required, if certain events occur that could impact the Company\u2019s ability to deduct interest payable on the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes or preclude the 2022 Notes from being recognized as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes, or if the Company is required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. In each case, the redemption would be at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2022 Notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.\nStockholders\u2019 Equity\nStockholders\u2019 equity was $2.77\u00a0billion at December\u00a031, 2021 compared to $2.61\u00a0billion at December\u00a031, 2020. \nThe increase in stockholders\u2019 equity is primarily associated with the $319.0 million in net income, which was partially offset by the $33.7\u00a0million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income, $92.1\u00a0million of shareholder dividends paid and the repurchase of $44.5 million of our common stock during 2021. The improvement in stockholders\u2019 equity was 6.1% for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021 compared to December\u00a031, 2020. \nAs of December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, our equity to asset ratio was 15.32% and 15.89%, respectively. Book value per common share was $16.90\n \nat December\u00a031, 2021 compared to $15.78 at December\u00a031, 2020. \nCommon Stock Cash Dividends.\n We declared cash dividends on our common stock of $0.56, $0.53 and $0.51 per share for the years ended December\u00a031, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The common stock dividend payout ratio for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was 28.88%, 40.88% and 29.57%\n \nrespectively. \nStock Repurchase Program\n. On January\u00a022, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 20,000,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock under the previously approved stock repurchase program, which brought the remaining balance of authorized shares to repurchase to 39,752,000 shares.\nDuring 2021, the Company utilized a portion of this stock repurchase program in order to repurchase a total of 1,753,000 shares with a weighted-average stock price of $25.34 per share. The 2021 earnings were used to fund the repurchases during the year. Shares repurchased under the program as of December\u00a031, 2021 total 17,661,335 shares. The remaining balance available for repurchase was 22,090,665 shares at December\u00a031, 2021.\nLiquidity and Capital Adequacy Requirements\nParent Company Liquidity\n. The primary sources for payment of our operating expenses, and dividends are current cash on hand ($291.6\u00a0million as of December\u00a031, 2021), dividends received from our bank subsidiary and a $20.0 million unfunded line of credit with another financial institution.\n86\nTable of \nContents\nRisk-Based Capital\n. We, as well as our bank subsidiary, are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and other discretionary actions by regulators that, if enforced, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Our capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators as to components, risk weightings and other factors.\nIn July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule to revise their risk-based and leverage capital requirements and their method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with the agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in \u201cBasel III: A Global Regulatory Framework for More Resilient Banks and Banking Systems\u201d and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (\u201cBasel III\u201d). Basel III applies to all depository institutions, bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $500 million or more, and savings and loan holding companies. Basel III became effective for the Company and its bank subsidiary on January 1, 2015. The capital conservation buffer requirement began being phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and increased by 0.625% on each subsequent January 1, until it reached 2.5% on January 1, 2019 when the phase-in period ended, and the full capital conservation buffer requirement became effective. \nBasel III permanently grandfathers trust preferred securities and other non-qualifying capital instruments that were issued and outstanding as of May 19, 2010 in the Tier 1 capital of bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009. The rule phases out of Tier 1 capital these non-qualifying capital instruments issued before May 19, 2010 by all other bank holding companies. Because our total consolidated assets were less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009, our outstanding trust preferred securities continue to be treated as Tier 1 capital. However, now that the Company has exceeded $15 billion in assets, the Tier 1 treatment of the Company\u2019s outstanding trust preferred securities will be phased out upon completion of the acquisition of Happy Bancshares, \nbut these securities will still be treated as Tier 2 capital.\nBasel III also amended the prompt corrective action rules to incorporate a \u201ccommon equity Tier 1 capital\u201d requirement and to raise the capital requirements for certain capital categories. In order to be adequately capitalized for purposes of the prompt corrective action rules, a banking organization is required to have at least a 4.5% \u201ccommon equity Tier 1 risk-based capital\u201d ratio, a 4% \u201cTier 1 leverage capital\u201d ratio, a 6% \u201cTier 1 risk-based capital\u201d ratio and an 8% \u201ctotal risk-based capital\u201d ratio. \nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require us to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and of Tier 1 capital to average assets. Management believes that, as of December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, we met all regulatory capital adequacy requirements to which we were subject.\nOn April 3, 2017, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.625% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2027 (the \u201cNotes\u201d). The Notes are unsecured, subordinated debt obligations and mature on April 15, 2027. The Company may, beginning with the interest payment date of April 15, 2022, and on any interest payment date thereafter, redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of redemption. The Company may also redeem the Notes at any time, including prior to April 15, 2022, at its option, in whole but not in part, if: (i) a change or prospective change in law occurs that could prevent the Company from deducting interest payable on the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes; (ii) a subsequent event occurs that could preclude the Notes from being recognized as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes; or (iii) the Company is required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended; in each case, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the redemption date. The Notes provide the Company with additional Tier 2 regulatory capital to support expected future growth. The Company is currently considering paying off the Notes. \n87\nTable of \nContents\nOn December 21, 2018, the federal banking agencies issued a joint final rule to revise their regulatory capital rules to permit bank holding companies and banks to phase-in, for regulatory capital purposes, the day-one impact of the new CECL accounting rule on retained earnings over a period of three years. As part of its response to the impact of COVID-19, on March 27, 2020, the federal banking regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that provided the option to temporarily delay certain effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period. The interim final rule allows bank holding companies and banks to delay for two years 100% of the day-one impact of adopting CECL and 25% of the cumulative change in the reported allowance for credit losses since adopting CECL. The Company has elected to adopt the interim final rule, which is reflected in the risk-based capital ratios presented below.\nTable 21 presents our risk-based capital ratios as of December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020.\nTable 21: Risk-Based Capital\nDecember 31, 2021\nDecember 31, 2020\n(Dollars in thousands)\nTier 1 capital\nStockholders\u2019 equity\n$\n2,765,721\u00a0\n$\n2,605,758\u00a0\nASC 326 transitional period adjustment\n55,143\u00a0\n57,333\u00a0\nGoodwill and core deposit intangibles, net\n(997,605)\n(1,003,288)\nUnrealized (gain) loss on available-for-sale securities\n(10,462)\n(44,120)\nTotal common equity Tier 1 capital\n1,812,797\u00a0\n1,615,683\u00a0\nQualifying trust preferred securities\n71,270\u00a0\n71,127\u00a0\nTotal Tier 1 capital\n1,884,067\u00a0\n1,686,810\u00a0\nTier 2 capital\nAllowance for credit losses\n236,714\u00a0\n245,473\u00a0\nASC 326 transitional period adjustment\n(55,143)\n(57,333)\nDisallowed allowance for credit losses (limited to 1.25% of risk weighted assets)\n(33,514)\n(36,911)\nQualifying allowance for credit losses\n148,057\u00a0\n151,229\u00a0\nQualifying subordinated notes\n299,824\u00a0\n299,199\u00a0\nTotal Tier 2 capital\n447,881\u00a0\n450,428\u00a0\nTotal risk-based capital\n$\n2,331,948\u00a0\n$\n2,137,238\u00a0\nAverage total assets for leverage ratio\n$\n16,960,683\u00a0\n$\n15,547,111\u00a0\nRisk weighted assets\n$\n11,793,539\u00a0\n$\n12,039,156\u00a0\nRatios at end of period\nCommon equity Tier 1 capital\n15.37\u00a0\n%\n13.42\u00a0\n%\nLeverage ratio\n11.11\u00a0\n10.85\u00a0\nTier 1 risk-based capital\n15.98\u00a0\n14.01\u00a0\nTotal risk-based capital\n19.77\u00a0\n17.75\u00a0\nMinimum guidelines \u2013 Basel III\nCommon equity Tier 1 capital\n7.00\u00a0\n%\n7.00\u00a0\n%\nLeverage ratio\n4.00\u00a0\n4.00\u00a0\nTier 1 risk-based capital\n8.50\u00a0\n8.50\u00a0\nTotal risk-based capital\n10.50\u00a0\n10.50\u00a0\nWell-capitalized guidelines\nCommon equity Tier 1 capital\n6.50\u00a0\n%\n6.50\u00a0\n%\nLeverage ratio\n5.00\u00a0\n5.00\u00a0\nTier 1 risk-based capital\n8.00\u00a0\n8.00\u00a0\nTotal risk-based capital\n10.00\u00a0\n10.00\u00a0\n88\nTable of \nContents\nAs of the most recent notification from regulatory agencies, our bank subsidiary was \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action.

Examples of these commitments include but are not limited to operating lease obligations, FHLB advances & other borrowings, lines of credit, subordinated debentures, unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. \n89\nTable of \nContents\nCommitments to extend credit and letters of credit are legally binding, conditional agreements generally having certain expiration or termination dates. These commitments generally require customers to maintain certain credit standards and are established based on management\u2019s credit assessment of the customer. The commitments may expire without being drawn upon. Therefore, the total commitment does not necessarily represent future requirements.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. The Company had total outstanding letters of credit amounting to $110.8\u00a0million and $56.1\u00a0million at December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, respectively, with the majority of maturities ranging from currently due to four years.\nTable 23 presents the anticipated funding requirements of our most significant financial commitments, excluding interest, as of December\u00a031, 2021.\nTable 23: Funding Requirements of Financial Commitments\nPayments Due by Period\nLess than\nOne Year\nOne-Three\nYears\nThree-Five\nYears\nGreater than\nFive Years\nTotal\n(In thousands)\nOperating lease obligations\n$\n7,714\u00a0\n$\n12,575\u00a0\n$\n10,899\u00a0\n$\n24,999\u00a0\n$\n56,187\u00a0\nFHLB advances & other borrowings by contractual maturity\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n400,000\u00a0\n400,000\u00a0\nSubordinated debentures\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n371,093\u00a0\n371,093\u00a0\nLoan commitments\n1,309,701\u00a0\n1,094,256\u00a0\n226,984\u00a0\n419,382\u00a0\n3,050,323\u00a0\nLetters of credit\n110,419\u00a0\n308\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n38\u00a0\n110,765\u00a0\nNon-GAAP Financial Measurements\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and the prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, this report contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP, including earnings, as adjusted; diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted; tangible book value per share; return on average assets, excluding intangible amortization; return on average assets, as adjusted; return on average common equity, as adjusted; return on average tangible equity excluding intangible amortization; return on average tangible equity, as adjusted; tangible equity to tangible assets; and efficiency ratio, as adjusted. \nWe believe these non-GAAP measures and ratios, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP measures and ratios, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. We believe investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP measures and ratios in assessing our operating results and related trends, and when planning and forecasting future periods. However, these non-GAAP measures and ratios should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or preferable to, ratios prepared in accordance with GAAP. \nThe tables below present non-GAAP reconciliations of earnings, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per share, as adjusted as well as the non-GAAP computations of tangible book value per share; return on average assets, excluding intangible amortization; return on average assets, as adjusted; return on average common equity, as adjusted; return on average tangible equity excluding intangible amortization; return on average tangible equity, as adjusted; tangible equity to tangible assets; and efficiency ratio, as adjusted. The items used in these calculations are included in financial results presented in accordance with GAAP.\nEarnings, as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are meaningful non-GAAP financial measures for management, as they exclude certain items such as merger expenses and/or certain gains and losses. Management believes the exclusion of these items in expressing earnings provides a meaningful foundation for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons, which management believes will aid both investors and analysts in analyzing our financial measures and predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of our business, because management does not consider these items to be relevant to ongoing financial performance. \n90\nTable of \nContents\nIn Table 24 below, we have provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP calculation of the financial measure for the periods indicated.\nTable 24: Earnings, As Adjusted\n2021\n2020\n2019\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nGAAP net income available to common shareholders (A)\n$\n319,021\u00a0\n$\n214,448\u00a0\n$\n289,539\u00a0\nAdjustments:\nFair value adjustment for marketable securities\n(7,178)\n1,978\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\nFDIC Small Bank Assessment Credit\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n(2,291)\nGain on securities\n(219)\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\nRecoveries on historic losses\n(5,107)\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\nBranch write-off expense\n\u2014\u00a0\n981\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\nSpecial dividend from equity investment\n(12,500)\n(10,185)\n(2,995)\nMerger expenses\n1,886\u00a0\n711\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\nHurricane expenses\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n897\u00a0\nOutsourced special project expense\n\u2014\u00a0\n1,092\u00a0\n1,531\u00a0\nTotal adjustments\n(23,118)\n(5,423)\n(2,858)\nTax-effect of adjustments\n(1)\n(6,225)\n(1,417)\n(738)\nAdjustments after-tax\n(16,893)\n(4,006)\n(2,120)\nBOLI redemption tax\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n3,667\u00a0\nTotal adjustments after tax (B)\n(16,893)\n(4,006)\n1,547\u00a0\nEarnings, as adjusted (C)\n$\n302,128\u00a0\n$\n210,442\u00a0\n$\n291,086\u00a0\nAverage diluted shares outstanding (D)\n164,858\u00a0\n165,373\u00a0\n167,804\u00a0\nGAAP diluted earnings per share: A/D\n$\n1.94\u00a0\n$\n1.30\u00a0\n$\n1.73\u00a0\nAdjustments after-tax: B/D\n(0.11)\n(0.03)\n\u2014\u00a0\nDiluted earnings per common share excluding adjustments: C/D\n$\n1.83\u00a0\n$\n1.27\u00a0\n$\n1.73\u00a0\n_____________________\n        (1) Blended statutory tax rate of 25.740% for 2021, 26.135% for 2020 and 25.819% for 2019.\nWe had $998.1\u00a0million, $1.00\u00a0billion and $995.0 million total goodwill, core deposit intangibles and other intangible assets as of December\u00a031, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nLiquidity and Market Risk Management\nAsset/Liability Management\n. Our management actively measures and manages interest rate risk. The asset/liability committees of the boards of directors of our holding company and bank subsidiary are also responsible for approving our asset/liability management policies, overseeing the formulation and implementation of strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and earnings, and reviewing our interest rate sensitivity position.\nOur objective is to manage liquidity in a way that ensures cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers are met in a timely and orderly fashion while ensuring the reliance on various funding sources does not become so heavily weighted to any one source that it causes undue risk to the bank.\n \nOur liquidity sources are prioritized based on availability and ease of activation. Our current liquidity condition is a primary driver in determining our funding needs and is a key component of our asset liability management.\n \nVarious sources of liquidity are available to meet the cash flow needs of depositors and borrowers. Our principal source of funds is core deposits, including checking, savings, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. We may also from time to time obtain wholesale funding through brokered deposits. Secondary sources of funding include advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window and other borrowings, such as through correspondent banking relationships. These secondary sources enable us to borrow funds at rates and terms which, at times, are more beneficial to us. Additionally, as needed, we can liquidate or utilize our available for sale investment portfolio as collateral to provide funds for an intermediate source of liquidity.\n \nInterest Rate Sensitivity.\n Our primary business is banking and the resulting earnings, primarily net interest income, are susceptible to changes in market interest rates. It is management\u2019s goal to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risks.\nA key element in the financial performance of financial institutions is the level and type of interest rate risk assumed. The single most significant measure of interest rate risk is the relationship of the repricing periods of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The more closely the repricing periods are correlated, the less interest rate risk we assume. We use net interest income simulation modeling and economic value of equity as the primary methods in analyzing and managing interest rate risk.\nOne of the tools that our management uses to measure short-term interest rate risk is a net interest income simulation model. This analysis calculates the difference between net interest income forecasted using base market rates and using a rising and a falling interest rate scenario. The income simulation model includes various assumptions regarding the re-pricing relationships for each of our products. Many of our assets are floating rate loans, which are assumed to re-price immediately, and proportional to the change in market rates, depending on their contracted index. Some loans and investments include the opportunity of prepayment (embedded options), and accordingly, the simulation model uses indexes to estimate these prepayments and reinvest their proceeds at current yields. Our non-term deposit products re-price overnight in the model while we project certain other deposits by product type to have stable balances based on our deposit history. This accounts for the portion of our portfolio that moves more slowly than market rates and changes at our discretion. \nThis analysis indicates the impact of changes in net interest income for the given set of rate changes and assumptions. It assumes the balance sheet remains static and that its structure does not change over the course of the year. It does not account for all factors that impact this analysis, including changes by management to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes or secondary impacts such as changes to our credit risk profile as interest rates change.\nFurthermore, loan prepayment rate estimates and spread relationships change regularly. Interest rate changes create changes in actual loan prepayment rates that will differ from the market estimates incorporated in this analysis. Changes that vary significantly from the assumptions may have significant effects on our net interest income.\nFor the rising and falling interest rate scenarios, the base market interest rate forecast was increased and decreased over twelve months by 200 and 100 basis points, respectively. At December 31, 2021, our net interest margin exposure related to these hypothetical changes in market interest rates was within the current guidelines established by us.\n95\nTable of \nContents\nTable 31 presents our sensitivity to net interest income as of December\u00a031, 2021.\nTable 31: Sensitivity of Net Interest Income\nInterest Rate Scenario\nPercentage\nChange\nfrom Base\nUp 200 basis points\n11.67\u00a0\n%\nUp 100 basis points\n5.42\u00a0\nDown 100 basis points\n(3.18)\nDown 200 basis points\n(5.26)", "companyName": "Home BancShares Inc", "cusip": "437076102"}
