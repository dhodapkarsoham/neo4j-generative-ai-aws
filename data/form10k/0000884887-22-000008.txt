Business. \nGeneral\nWe are one of the leading cruise companies in the world. We control and operate three global cruise brands: Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises (collectively, our \"Global Brands\"). We also own a 50% joint venture interest in TUI Cruises GmbH (\"TUIC\"), that operates the German brands TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises (collectively, our \"Partner Brands\"). Together, our Global Brands and our Partner Brands operate a combined total of 61 ships in the cruise vacation industry with an aggregate capacity of approximately 140,855 berths as of December\u00a031, 2021.\nOur ships operate on a selection of worldwide itineraries that call on approximately 1,000 destinations on all seven continents. In addition to our headquarters in Miami, Florida, we have offices and a network of international representatives around the world, which primarily focus on sales and market development.\nWe compete principally by operating valued brands that offer exceptional service provided by our crew and on the basis of innovation and quality of ships, variety of itineraries, choice of destinations and price. We believe that our commitment to build state-of-the-art ships and to invest in the maintenance and upgrade of our fleet to, among other things, incorporate many of our latest signature innovations, allows us to continue to attract new and loyal repeat guests.\nRoyal Caribbean was founded in 1968 as a partnership. Its corporate structure has evolved over the years and, the current parent corporation, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., was incorporated on July 23, 1985 in the Republic of Liberia under the Business Corporation Act of Liberia.\nCOVID-19 \nReturn to Healthy Sailing\nWe have restarted our global cruise operations in a phased manner, following our voluntary suspension of global cruise operations that commenced in March of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. By the end of December 2021, we operated 50 of our Global and Partner Brand ships, representing over 85% of our capacity, and we have carried approximately 1.3\u00a0million guests since we resumed operations.\nOur return to service efforts incorporate our enhanced health and safety protocols, and the requirements of regulatory agencies, which has resulted in reduced guest occupancy, modified itineraries and vaccination protocols. We experienced service disruptions and cancelled several sailings in the first quarter of 2022 due to the impact from the Omicron variant (\"Omicron\"). Service disruptions have abated as COVID-19 cases have declined. Despite the service disruptions and cancellations, we believe the overall trajectory of our return to service remains unchanged. We expect that by the end of the first quarter of 2022, 53 out of 62 ships, including \nWonder of the Seas,\n which was delivered in January 2022, will have been brought back to service. Additionally, we expect that the rest of the fleet will return to operations before the summer season. See Part II. Item 7. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n and \nRecent Developments: COVID-19,\n and Note 1. \nGeneral\n to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \nfor further details on the impact of COVID-19 on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Global Brands\nOur Global Brands include Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, and Silversea Cruises. We believe our Global Brands possess the versatility to enter multiple cruise market segments within the cruise vacation industry. Although each of our Global Brands has its own marketing style, as well as ships and crews of various sizes, the nature of the products sold and services delivered by our Global Brands share a common base (i.e., the sale and provision of cruise vacations). Our Global Brands also offer similar itineraries as well as similar cost and revenue components. The itineraries of our Global Brands are subject to the phased resumption of our operations and local restrictions. In addition, our Global Brands have historically sourced passengers from similar markets around the world and operated in similar economic environments with a significant degree of commercial overlap. As a result, we strategically manage our Global Brands as a single business with the ultimate objective of maximizing long-term shareholder value. \nRoyal Caribbean International\nRoyal Caribbean International is the world's largest cruise brand. The brand competes in both the contemporary and premium segments of the cruise vacation industry and appeals to families with children of all ages, as well as both older and younger couples. Royal Caribbean International offers cruises and land destinations that generally feature a casual ambiance, as well as a variety of activities and entertainment venues. We believe that the quality of the Royal Caribbean \n2\nTable of Contents\nInternational brand allows it to achieve market coverage that is among the broadest of any of the major cruise brands in the cruise vacation industry. Royal Caribbean International\u2019s strategy is to attract an array of vacationing guests by offering a wide variety of itineraries to destinations worldwide, including Alaska, Asia, Australia, the Bahamas, Bermuda, Canada, the Caribbean, Europe, the Panama Canal and New Zealand, with cruise lengths generally ranging from one  to 25 nights. Royal Caribbean International offers multiple innovative options for onboard dining, entertainment and other onboard activities. Because of the brand\u2019s ability to deliver extensive and innovative product offerings at an excellent value to consumers, we believe Royal Caribbean International is well positioned to attract new consumers to cruising and to continue to bring loyal repeat guests back for their next vacation.\nRoyal Caribbean International operates 25 ships with an aggregate capacity of approximately 88,400 berths. Additionally, as of December\u00a031, 2021, Royal Caribbean International had five ships on order with an aggregate capacity of approximately 28,200 berths, which consisted of two Oasis-class ships and the first three ships of a new generation, known as the Icon-class ships. The two Oasis-class ships include \nWonder of the Seas\n, which was delivered in January of  2022, and our sixth Oasis-class ship, which is expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2024. The  Icon-class ships include \nIcon of the Seas,\n which is expected to be delivered in the third quarter of 2023, and the second and third Icon-class ships, which are expected to be delivered in the second quarters of 2025 and 2026, respectively. \nThe expected delivery dates for all of our ships on order are subject to change in the event of shipyard construction delays. See Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion on the impact of COVID-19 on shipyard operations.\nCelebrity Cruises \nCelebrity Cruises is positioned within the luxury segment of the cruise vacation industry. Celebrity Cruises\u2019 strategy is to target affluent consumers by delivering a destination-rich experience on upscale ships that offer, among other things, luxurious accommodations, refined design-forward spaces, world-class service and culinary excellence. Celebrity Cruises offers a range of itineraries to destinations, including Alaska, Asia, Australia, Bermuda, Canada, the Caribbean, Europe, the Galapagos Islands, Hawaii, New Zealand, the Panama Canal and South America, with cruise lengths ranging from two to 18 nights.\nCelebrity Cruises operates 14 ships with an aggregate capacity of approximately 29,215 berths. Additionally, as of December\u00a031, 2021, Celebrity Cruises had two ships on order with an aggregate capacity of approximately 6,500 berths. These ships include two Edge-class ships, \nCelebrity Beyond\n and \nCelebrity Ascent\n, which are expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2022 and in the fourth quarter of 2023, respectively. In addition, we have an agreement in place with Chantiers de l\u2019Atlantique to build an additional Edge-class ship with capacity of approximately 3,250 berths, estimated for delivery in 2025, which is contingent upon completion of certain conditions precedent and financing. \nSilversea Cruises\nSilversea Cruise Holding Ltd. (\"Silversea Cruises\") is an ultra-luxury and expedition cruise line with smaller ships, high standards of accommodations, fine dining, personalized service and exotic itineraries. Silversea Cruises delivers distinctive destination experiences by visiting unique and remote destinations, including the Galapagos Islands, Antarctica and the Arctic with cruise itineraries generally ranging from five to 25 nights. \nSilversea Cruises operates ten ships, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 3,950 berths, including the brand's newest ship, \nSilver Dawn\n, which was delivered in the fourth quarter of 2021 and is expected to commence revenue generating voyages in the second quarter of 2022. Additionally, as of December\u00a031, 2021, Silversea Cruises had two ships on order with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1,460 berths. The Evolution-class ships are expected to be delivered in the second quarters of 2023 and 2024, respectively.\nAzamara \nEffective March 19, 2021, we sold our wholly-owned brand, Azamara Cruises (\"Azamara\"), including its three-ship fleet and associated intellectual property, to Sycamore Partners for $201 million, before closing adjustments. The sale of Azamara does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results, as we continue to provide similar itineraries to and source passengers from the markets served by the Azamara business.\nOur Partner Brands\nOur Global Brands are complemented by our interest in TUIC, our 50%-owned joint venture that operates the German brands TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises (collectively, our \"Partner Brands\").\nTUIC is a joint venture owned 50% by us and 50% by TUI AG, a German tourism company, which is designed to serve the contemporary and premium segments of the German cruise market by offering products tailored for German \n3\nTable of Contents\nguests. All onboard activities, services, shore excursions and menu offerings are designed to suit the preferences of this target market. \nTUI Cruises operates seven ships, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 17,700 berths. Additionally, as of December\u00a031, 2021, TUI Cruises had three ships on order with an aggregate capacity of approximately 11,100 berths, that are expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2024, the fourth quarter of 2024 and the second quarter of 2026, respectively.\nHapag-Lloyd Cruises operates two luxury liners and three smaller expedition ships, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1,590 berths. Hapag-Lloyd Cruises did not have any ships on order as of December\u00a031, 2021. Refer to Note 7\n. Other Assets\n to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \nfor further details.  \nIndustry \nThe cruising industry has been considered a well-established vacation sector in the North American, European and Australian markets and a developing sector in several other emerging markets. As the industry proceeds with its resumption of operations, we believe that cruising will continue to be a popular vacation choice in the long-term due to its inherent value, extensive itineraries and variety of shipboard and shoreside activities.\nThe Company and other industry participants voluntarily suspended operations in March of 2020 and gradually resumed operations in the second half of 2021, resulting in a limited number of operated cruises in 2020 and 2021. As a result, representative information of market penetration and other indicators are not meaningful for 2020 and 2021. For the five year period prior to 2020, industry data indicated that market penetration rates were still low and that a significant portion of cruise guests carried in those years were first-time cruisers. We believe this presents an opportunity for operational and financial recovery and long-term growth for the industry as it continues to resume operations.\nThe following table details industry market penetration rates for North America, Europe and Asia/Pacific for the five years prior to the impact of COVID-19 in 2020, computed based on the number of annual cruise guests as a percentage of the total population:\nYear \n(1)\nNorth America\n(2)(3)\nEurope\n(2)(4)\nAsia/Pacific\n(2)(5)\n2015\n3.36%\n1.25%\n0.08%\n2016\n3.43%\n1.23%\n0.11%\n2017\n3.56%\n1.28%\n0.15%\n2018\n3.87%\n1.38%\n0.16%\n2019\n3.89%\n1.41%\n0.20%\n___________________________________________________________________\n(1)\nHistorically, we have reported annual comparable information for relevant comparisons to other periods. The 2020 suspension of global cruise operations as a result of COVID-19 and the gradual resumption of operations in 2021 do not allow for a meaningful comparison to prior years' information and as such the 2020 and 2021 data has been excluded from this table.\n(2)\nSource: Our estimates are based on a combination of data obtained from publicly available sources including the International Monetary Fund, United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Cruise Lines International Association (\"CLIA\") and G.P.

As of December\u00a031, 2021, there were approximately 78 ships on order with an estimated 183,000 berths that are expected to be placed in service in the global cruise market through 2027, not taking into account ships taken out of service or ordered during these periods. Cruise ships in the industry were taken out of service at an accelerated rate and new ship orders were deferred due to global cruise operation restrictions in 2020 and limited sailings in 2021 resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The global cruise industry carried approximately 30.0 million cruise guests in 2019 and approximately 28.5 million in 2018. \nThe following table details the growth in global weighted average berths and the global, North American, European and Asia/Pacific cruise guests for the five years prior to the impact of COVID-19 in 2020 (in thousands, except berth data):\nYear \n(1)\nWeighted-Average\nSupply of\nBerths\nMarketed\nGlobally\n(2)\nRoyal Caribbean Group Total Berths\n(3)\nGlobal\nCruise\nGuests\n(2)\nNorth American Cruise Guests\n(2)(4)\nEuropean Cruise Guests\n(2)(5)\nAsia/Pacific Cruise Guests\n(2)(6)\n2015\n469,000\n112,700\n23,000\n12,004\n6,587\n3,129\n2016\n493,000\n123,270\n24,000\n12,274\n6,512\n4,466\n2017\n515,000\n124,070\n26,700\n12,865\n6,779\n5,415\n2018\n546,000\n135,520\n28,500\n14,062\n7,343\n5,685\n2019\n579,000\n141,570\n30,000\n14,246\n7,554\n7,317\n___________________________________________________________________\n(1)\nHistorically, we have reported annual comparable information for relevant comparisons to other periods.

We use data obtained from Seatrade Insider, Cruise Industry News and company press releases to estimate weighted-average supply of berths and CLIA and G.P. Wild to estimate cruise guest information. In addition, our estimates incorporate our own analysis utilizing the same publicly available cruise industry data as a base. \n(3)\nTotal berths include our berths related to our Global Brands and Partner Brands.\n(4)\nOur estimates include the United States and Canada.\n(5)\nOur estimates include European countries relevant to the industry (most notably: the Nordics, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom). \n(6)\nOur estimates include Southeast Asia (most notably: Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines), East Asia (most notably: China and Japan), South Asia (most notably: India) and Oceania (most notably: Australia and New Zealand) regions.\nNorth America\nIndustry cruise guests have been primarily sourced from North America, which represented approximately 47% of global cruise guests in 2019. The compound annual growth rate in cruise guests sourced from this market was approximately 4% from 2015 to 2019.\nEurope\nIndustry cruise guests sourced from Europe represented approximately 25% of global cruise guests in 2019. The compound annual growth rate in cruise guests sourced from this market was approximately 3% from 2015 to 2019.\nAsia/Pacific\nIndustry cruise guests sourced from the Asia/Pacific region represented approximately 24% of global cruise guests in 2019. The compound annual growth rate in cruise guests sourced from this market was approximately 24% from 2015 to 2019. \n5\nTable of Contents\nCompetition\nWe compete with a number of cruise lines. Our principal competitors are Carnival Corporation & plc, which owns, among other brands, Aida Cruises, Carnival Cruise Line, Costa Cruises, Cunard Line, Holland America Line, P&O Cruises, Princess Cruises and Seabourn; Disney Cruise Line; MSC Cruises; Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd, which owns Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises, and Regent Seven Seas Cruises; and Virgin Voyages. Cruise lines also compete with other vacation alternatives such as land-based resort hotels, internet-based alternative lodging sites and sightseeing destinations for consumers\u2019 leisure time. The COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions and general economic conditions have significantly affected companies within the vacation market which may result in a changed competitive landscape as we continue to return to service.\nOperating Focus \nOur principal operating strategies remain consistent with our historical strategies, yet have been affected by the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, on our Company's operations. We continue to prioritize operating strategies that support the return of our full fleet into operations, the delivery of memorable vacation experiences to our guests, the healthy and safe return of global cruising for guests, crew and the communities visited, and the enhancement of our financial results and liquidity. We strive to execute these strategies in a socially and environmentally responsible manner, working with our various business and community partners as we build toward a more sustainable cruise industry. \nOur Company's operating focus is as follows:\n\u2022\ndeliver outstanding vacation experiences to our guests;\n\u2022\nprotect the health, safety and security of our guests and employees; \n\u2022\nsupport the healthy return of cruising globally along with our industry partners, including national and local governments and regulators, the communities in which we operate, other cruise companies, shipyards, our guests and trade partners; \n\u2022\nstrengthen our consumer engagement in order to enhance our revenues; \n\u2022\nfocus on cost efficiency, adequate cash and liquidity, and manage our balance sheet, with the overall goals of sustaining our operations and being well positioned during our recovery, and, in the long-term, maximizing our return on invested capital and shareholder value; \n\u2022\nprotect the environment in which our vessels and organization operate; \n\u2022\ninvest in our workforce in order to better serve our global guest base and grow our business, and promote gender equality, diversity and inclusion;\n\u2022\nincrease the awareness and market penetration of our brands globally;\n\u2022\nstrategically invest in our fleet through the upgrade and maintenance of existing ships and the transfer of key innovations, while prudently expanding our fleet with new state-of-the-art cruise ships;\n\u2022\ncapitalize on the portability and flexibility of our ships by deploying them into those markets and itineraries that provide opportunities to optimize returns, while continuing our focus on existing key markets;\n\u2022\nprovide extraordinary destination experiences and state-of-the-art port facilities to our guests;\n\u2022\ncontinue to deploy technology capabilities and advanced uses of data and analytics to deliver innovative customer experiences as well as to create operational efficiencies that enhance employee satisfaction; and\n\u2022\nmaintain strong relationships with travel advisors, which continue to be the principal industry distribution channel, while enhancing our consumer outreach programs.\nSafety and health policies\nWe are committed to protecting the health, safety and security of our guests, employees and others working on our behalf. Our efforts in these areas are managed by several departments within the Company that are responsible for  maritime safety, global security, environmental stewardship and medical/public health activities; overseen by the Safety, \n6\nTable of Contents\nEnvironment, Sustainability and Health Committee of our board of directors and informed by a Maritime Advisory Board of experts. Refer to the \nRegulation - Safety and Security Regulations \nsection below for further information. \nSupport the healthy return of cruising\nWe continue to work and collaborate with epidemiological and policy experts, health authorities and various governments around the globe to drive a healthy and safe return to cruising for guests, crew and the communities visited. We work in close partnership and communication with our contracted shipyards to work towards a safe and effective shipyard working environment in the midst of COVID-19. Refer to the \nRegulation - CDC COVID-19 Program for Cruise Ships Operating in U.S. Waters \nsection below for further information.\nWe have established flexible cruise pricing and booking programs (e.g. Cruise with Confidence, Best Price Guarantee, COVID Protection Policy, and all-inclusive pricing) that present our guests with options and value as we continue our return to service. The travel advisor community has been a vital partner in our success, and we are committed to assist travel advisors during this challenging time with essential financial relief (e.g., the RCL CARES program). \nConsumer engagement\nWe place a strong focus on identifying the needs of our guests and creating product features and innovations that our customers value. We are focused on the acquisition and targeting of high-value guests by better understanding consumer data and insights to create communication strategies that resonate with our target audiences. \nWe target customers at important consumer decision points and identify underlying needs for which guests are willing to pay a premium. We rely on various programs and technologies during the cruise-planning, cruising and after-cruise periods aimed at increasing ticket prices, onboard revenues and occupancy. We have and expect to strategically invest in onboard projects on our ships that we believe drive marketability, profitability and improve the guest experience.\nFocus on cost efficiency, capital allocation, adequate cash and liquidity and managing of our balance sheet\nWe are focused on improving our cost structure to best position us during our recovery. We are leveraging our scale and shifting our resources behind our Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea brands. We continue to focus on liquidity through cash flow optimization and additional financing sources while managing our balance sheet, with the goal of being well positioned during our recovery. Additionally, we agreed with certain of our lenders that we will not pay dividends or engage in stock repurchases until the end of the third quarter of 2022.  In the event we declare a dividend or engage in share repurchases, we will need to repay the amounts deferred under our export credit facilities. \nWe are focused on maintaining a strong liquidity position and a balanced debt maturity profile, while making progress on achieving an unsecured balance sheet, lowering interest expense, and reducing leverage. We believe these strategies enhance our ability to achieve our overall goal of maximizing our long-term shareholder value. \nProtect the environment \nWe are focused on the environmental health of the marine environment and communities in which we operate. This includes reducing our carbon footprint through our Destination Net Zero strategy, our energy and carbon efficiencies included in the design of our new capacity, our ongoing energy management program on our existing fleet and the development of new technologies.\nDestination Net Zero is our decarbonization strategy that focuses on how to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and assessing the feasibility of establishing Science-Based Targets. Destination Net Zero\u2019s four-pronged approach includes the modernization of our global brands fleet through the introduction of new energy-efficient and alternatively fueled vessels, continued investment in energy efficiency programs, development of alternative fuel and alternative power solutions, and optimized deployment and integration of strategic shore-based supply chains. We are in the early stages of developing our roadmap to achieve these goals. It is already clear that such a strategy will require new fuels that are not available today. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - \u201c\nOur sustainability activities, including environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, could result in reputational risks, increased costs and other risks\n\u201d for a discussion of the risks associated with our environmental initiatives. \nOur long-term partnership with the World Wildlife Fund focuses on greenhouse gas reduction strategies, sustainable sourcing of food supplies, waste management, sustainable destinations and guest education on ocean conservation issues, which supports onboard conservation efforts such as our reduced use of plastics. We are also committed to assessing and managing potential impacts related to our operations in the communities in which we operate. \n7\nTable of Contents\nWe believe in transparent reporting on our environmental and sustainability stewardship, as well as our social and governance efforts, and have annually published a Sustainability Report since 2008. This report, the current version of which is accessible on our corporate website, highlights our progress with regards to those environmental and social aspects of our business that we believe are most significant to our organization and stakeholders. In addition to providing an overview, the report complies with the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative and the Sustainable Accounting Standards Board. Our corporate website also provides information about our environmental performance goals and sustainability initiatives. The foregoing information contained on our website is not part of any of these reports and is not incorporated by reference herein or in any other report or document we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Refer to the \nRegulation - Environmental Regulations \nsection below for further information.\nInvesting in our workforce and promoting equality, diversity and inclusion\nWe believe that our employees, both shipboard and shoreside, are a critical success factor for our business. We strive to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain the best employees, who provide our guests with extraordinary vacations. Our ability to attract, engage, and retain key employees has been and will remain critical to our success. \nWe focus on providing our employees with a competitive compensation structure, development opportunities, and other personal and professional growth opportunities in order to strengthen and support our human capital. We also select, develop and have strategies to retain high performing leaders to advance the enterprise now and in the future. To that end, we pay special attention to identifying high performing potential leaders and developing bench strength so these leaders can assume leadership roles throughout the organization.\nWe strive to maintain a work environment that reinforces collaboration, motivation and innovation, and believe that maintaining a strong employee-focused culture is beneficial to the growth and expansion of our business. We foster diversity and inclusion among our broad employee base. Refer to the \nHuman Capital\n section below for further information.\nGlobal awareness and market penetration \nWe increase brand awareness and market penetration of our cruise brands in various ways, including the use of communication strategies and marketing campaigns designed to emphasize the qualities of each brand and to broaden the awareness of the brand, especially among target groups. Our marketing strategies include the use of travel advisors, traditional media, mobile and digital media as well as social media, influencers and brand websites. Our brands engage past and potential guests by collaborating with travel partners and through call centers, international offices and international representatives. In addition, our Global Brands target repeat guests with exclusive benefits offered through their respective loyalty programs.\nWe sell and market our Global Brands to guests outside of the United States and Canada through the combined efforts of internationally focused internal resources and a network of independent international representatives located throughout the world. While the majority of our guests for our Global Brands come from North America, we also sell and market our cruise brands to guests in countries outside of North America by tailoring itineraries and onboard product offerings to the cultural characteristics and preferences of our international guests. In addition, we explore opportunities that may arise to acquire or develop brands tailored to specific markets. \nPrior to the impact of COVID-19 in 2020, passenger ticket revenues generated by sales originating in countries outside of the United States were approximately 35% of total passenger ticket revenues in 2019, and 39% in 2018. International guests have grown from approximately 2.5 million in 2015 to approximately 2.6 million in 2019. Refer to Item 1A. \nRisk Factors\n - \u201c\nConducting business globally may result in increased costs and other risks\u201d \nfor a discussion of the risks associated with our international operations.\nFleet upgrade and maintenance\nWe place a strong focus on innovation, which we seek to achieve by introducing new concepts on our new ships and continuously making improvements to our fleet through modernization projects and key technological improvements. Several of these innovations have become signature elements of our brands. For the Royal Caribbean International brand, we introduced the \u201cRoyal Promenade\u201d (a boulevard with shopping, dining and entertainment venues) and interior balconies on the Oasis class ships and a two-level family suite on \nSymphony of the Seas\n. For the Celebrity Cruises brand, we enhanced many of the brand's design features through the introduction of the Solstice class ships. More recently, with the introduction of \nCelebrity Edge\n, we introduced the \"Magic Carpet\" (a cantilevered, floating platform that reaches a height of 13 stories above sea level and can serve as a dining venue, full bar and platform for live music) and newly designed staterooms with an \"Infinite Veranda\" where, with the touch of a button, the veranda becomes part of the entire living space.\n8\nTable of Contents\nAs part of the newbuild and modernization programs, we also seek to bring innovations in the areas of safety, reliability and energy efficiency to our fleet.\nWe are committed to building state-of-the-art ships at a moderate growth rate and we believe our success in this area provides us with a competitive advantage. Our newer vessels traditionally generate higher revenue yield premiums and are more efficient to operate than older vessels. \nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, our Global Brands and Partner Brands have 12 ships on order. Refer to the \nOperations\n section below for further information on our ships on order. In addition, we regularly evaluate opportunities to order new ships, purchase existing ships or sell ships in our current fleet while ensuring that we remain focused on the returns we generate on invested capital and maintaining a high level of discipline on capital spending and operating leverage.\nDuring 2021, we sold the Azamara brand, which included three vessels: \nAzamara Journey, Azamara Quest\n and\n Azamara Pursuit\n.\nMarkets and itineraries\nIn an effort to penetrate untapped markets, diversify our consumer base and respond to changing economic and geopolitical market conditions, we continue to seek opportunities to deploy ships to new and stronger markets and itineraries throughout the world. The portability of our ships allows us to deploy our ships to meet demand within our existing and new cruise markets. We make deployment decisions generally 18 to 28 months in advance, with the goal of optimizing the overall profitability of our portfolio. Additionally, the infrastructure investments we have made to create a flexible global sourcing model have made our brands relevant in a number of markets around the world, which allows us to be opportunistic and source the highest yielding guests for our itineraries.\nOur ships offer a wide selection of itineraries that call on approximately 1,000 destinations in 120 countries, spanning all seven continents. We are focused on maximizing long-term shareholder returns by operating in established markets while growing our presence in developing markets. New capacity has allowed us to expand into new markets and itineraries. Our brands have expanded their mix of itineraries while strengthening our ability to further penetrate the Asian and Australian markets. The acquisition of Silversea Cruises added more than 500 new destinations allowing us to expand and enhance our selection of exotic itineraries.\nWe have developed new and attractive itineraries that have allowed us to resume our operations on a staggered basis and in consideration of local restrictions. We are also responding quickly to changes in market demand, as observed in our new bookings.\nDestination experiences and port facilities\nIn order to provide unique destination experiences to our guests, we have invested in our private land destinations. In 2018, we announced Perfect Day Island Collection, an initiative to develop a series of private island destinations around the world. The first island in the collection, Perfect Day at CocoCay, opened in Spring 2019 and includes a wide range of attractions, such as a full water park, zip line course,  freshwater pools, helium balloon ride, splash pads and a beach club. As a result of the operational disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and in an effort to bolster our liquidity, we have delayed previously announced Perfect Day site openings and are reassessing their timing as well as the timing of our  Royal Beach Club offering portfolio. We are also reassessing our investment in other destinations.\nIn an effort to secure desirable berthing facilities for our ships, and to provide new or enhanced cruise destinations for our guests, we have actively assisted or invested in the development or enhancement of certain port facilities and infrastructure, including mixed-use commercial properties, located in strategic ports of call. For instance, a new homeport cruise terminal of approximately 170,000 square feet was completed at Port Miami in Miami, Florida in 2018. We expect  that our new homeport cruise terminal in Galveston, Texas will be completed in 2022.\nGenerally, we collaborate with local, private or governmental entities by providing management and/or financial assistance and often enter into long-term port usage arrangements. Our participation in these efforts is most often accomplished via investments with the relevant government authority and/or various other strategic partnerships established to develop and/or operate the port facilities, by providing direct development and management expertise or in certain limited circumstances, by providing direct or indirect financial support. In exchange for our involvement, we generally secure preferential berthing rights for our ships. \nTechnological capabilities \nTechnology is a pervasive part of virtually every business process we use to support our strategic focus and provide a quality experience to our customers before, during and after their cruise. Technology also plays a critical role in the \n9\nTable of Contents\nmeasures and protocols that we have developed and will continue to develop to mitigate COVID-19 on our cruise ships. For example, through the deployment of our innovative electronic safety drill (\"Muster 2.0\") program, we have added convenience, allowed for physical distancing, and improved our guests experience regarding the mandatory safety briefing. Additionally, through the in-app messaging technology we are enhancing guest check-in to support education, testing and screening information prior to embarkation, and to support onboard detection contingency scenarios and protocols, and most importantly promote the health and safety of guests and crew.  \nWe have continued to integrate digital capabilities into our operations and have increased our focus in bringing in data analytics and artificial intelligence into our processes. For example, we continue to develop tools to enhance our guests' digital experience and grow onboard revenue, by making it easier for our guests to plan and maximize their next vacation through our apps. Also, we have continued the deployment of our innovative guest journey solutions across our fleet from online check-in to port embarkation to onboard cruise experience. At the same time, we are investing in shipboard operational technology to facilitate casino play, hotel maintenance, as well as the optimization of marine maintenance. In concert with our destination focus, our island technology solutions are now enabling our guests to remain connected with WiFi access, order food and beverage as well as take advantage of all the island based activities with the same ease as onboard our ships.\nInvestments in our core platforms, as well as the trade and direct distribution channels, are delivering the benefit of more modernized solutions with scalability and faster self-service response times while also deploying new features such as flight packages and additional promotional offer capabilities.\nCyber security and data privacy are an ongoing focus, and we have made and will continue to make investments to protect our customer data, intellectual property and global operations. \nTravel advisor support and consumer outreach \nTravel advisors continue to be a significant sourcing channel of ticket sales for our ships. We believe in the value of this distribution channel and invest in maintaining strong relationships with our travel partners. To accomplish this goal, we seek to maintain competitive commission rates and incentive structures with the marketplace. We continuously work with travel advisors to sell upgrades and add-ons such as air and pre-cruise purchases to improve the retention and profitability of the channel. We provide brand dedicated sales representatives who serve as consultants to our travel partners. We also provide trained customer service representatives, call centers and online training tools.\nAt the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we launched the RCL CARES program which provided dedicated financial guidance as travel advisors navigated government relief benefits, including small business loans and the Paycheck Protection Program. As part of the RCL Cares program, we also launched our Pay it Forward program in February 2021, which made available interest free commercial loans for qualifying travel advisors to begin their recovery efforts.\nIn addition, we continue to operate our Consumer Outreach department, which provides consumers 24-hour access to our vacation planners and customer service agents in our call centers. In addition, we maintain and invest in our websites, including mobile applications and mobile websites. We enable our guests to communicate and book with us through various channels such as phone, web, chat, text message, and/or email. \nWe also have an Onboard Cruise Sales department to help guests book their next cruise vacations while onboard our ships.\nGuest Services\nWe offer to handle virtually all travel aspects related to guest reservations and transportation, including arranging guest pre- and post-hotel stay arrangements and air transportation. \nRoyal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises offer recognition and status upgrades to their guests through their loyalty programs, Crown & Anchor Society, Captain\u2019s Club, and Venetian Society, respectively, to encourage repeat business. Crown & Anchor Society has approximately 16.5 million members worldwide. Captain\u2019s Club and Venetian Society have approximately 5.1 million members combined worldwide. Members are recognized through increasing membership status by accumulating cruise points or credits, depending on the brand, which may be redeemed on future sailings. Members are awarded points or credits in proportion to the number of cruise days and stateroom category. The loyalty programs provide tiers of membership benefits which entitle guests to upgraded experiences and recognition relative to the status achieved once the guests have accumulated the number of cruise points or credits specified for each tier. In addition, upon achieving a certain level of cruise points or credits, members benefit from reciprocal membership benefits across all of our loyalty programs. Examples of the benefits available under our loyalty programs include, but are not limited to, priority ship embarkation, priority waitlist for shore excursions, complimentary laundry service, \n10\nTable of Contents\ncomplimentary Internet, booklets with onboard discount offers, upgraded bathroom amenities, private seating on the pool deck, ship tours and, in the case of our most loyal guests who have achieved the highest levels of cruise points or credits, complimentary cruise days. We regularly work to enhance each of our loyalty programs by adding new features and amenities in order to reward our repeat guests. \nOperations\nCruise Ships and Itineraries \nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, our Global Brands and Partner Brands collectively operated 61 ships with a selection of worldwide itineraries that call on approximately 1,000 destinations. \nThe following table presents summary information concerning ships that we expect will be in our fleet in 2022 under our Global Brands and Partner Brands. \n .\nShip\nYear Ship\nBuilt\nYear Ship\nIn Service or Delivered, if after 2021\n(1)\nApproximate\nBerths\nRoyal Caribbean International\nWonder of the Seas\n2022\n2022\n5,700\nOdyssey of the Seas\n2021\n2021\n4,200\nSpectrum of the Seas\n2019\n2019\n4,150\nSymphony of the Seas\n2018\n2018\n5,500\nHarmony of the Seas\n2016\n2016\n5,500\nOvation of the Seas\n2016\n2016\n4,150\nAnthem of the Seas\n2015\n2015\n4,150\nQuantum of the Seas\n2014\n2014\n4,150\nAllure of the Seas\n2010\n2010\n5,500\nOasis of the Seas\n2009\n2009\n5,600\nIndependence of the Seas\n2008\n2008\n3,850\nLiberty of the Seas\n2007\n2007\n3,800\nFreedom of the Seas\n2006\n2006\n3,950\nJewel of the Seas\n2004\n2004\n2,200\nMariner of the Seas\n2003\n2003\n3,350\nSerenade of the Seas\n2003\n2003\n2,150\nNavigator of the Seas\n2002\n2002\n3,400\nBrilliance of the Seas\n2002\n2002\n2,150\nAdventure of the Seas\n2001\n2001\n3,350\nRadiance of the Seas\n2001\n2001\n2,150\nExplorer of the Seas\n2000\n2000\n3,300\nVoyager of the Seas\n1999\n1999\n3,450\nVision of the Seas\n1998\n1998\n2,050\nEnchantment of the Seas\n1997\n1997\n2,300\nRhapsody of the Seas\n1997\n1997\n2,050\nGrandeur of the Seas\n1996\n1996\n2,000\nCelebrity Cruises\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCelebrity Beyond\n2022\n2022\n3,250\nCelebrity Apex\n2020\n2020\n2,900\nCelebrity Flora\n2019\n2019\n100\nCelebrity Edge\n2018\n2018\n2,900\nCelebrity Reflection\n2012\n2012\n3,050\n11\nTable of Contents\nShip\nYear Ship\nBuilt\nYear Ship\nIn Service or Delivered, if after 2021\n(1)\nApproximate\nBerths\nCelebrity Silhouette\n2011\n2011\n2,900\nCelebrity Eclipse\n2010\n2010\n2,850\nCelebrity Equinox\n2009\n2009\n2,850\nCelebrity Solstice\n2008\n2008\n2,850\nCelebrity Xploration\n2007\n2016\n15\nCelebrity Constellation\n2002\n2002\n2,200\nCelebrity Summit\n2001\n2001\n2,200\nCelebrity Infinity\n2001\n2001\n2,150\nCelebrity Xpedition\n2001\n2004\n50\nCelebrity Millennium\n2000\n2000\n2,200\nSilversea Cruises\nSilver Dawn\n(3)\n2021\n2022\n600\nSilver Origin\n2020\n2020\n100\nSilver Moon\n2020\n2020\n600\nSilver Muse\n2017\n2017\n600\nSilver Spirit\n2009\n2009\n600\nSilver Whisper\n2001\n2001\n400\nSilver Shadow\n2000\n2000\n400\nSilver Wind\n1995\n1995\n250\nSilver Cloud\n1994\n1994\n250\nSilver Explorer\n1989\n2008\n150\nTUI Cruises\nMein Schiff 2\n(2)\n2019\n2019\n2,900\nMein Schiff 1\n2018\n2018\n2,900\nMein Schiff 6\n2017\n2017\n2,500\nMein Schiff 5\n2016\n2016\n2,500\nMein Schiff 4\n2015\n2015\n2,500\nMein Schiff 3\n2014\n2014\n2,500\nMein Schiff Herz\n1997\n2011\n1,900\nHapag-Lloyd\nHanseatic Spirit\n2021\n2021\n230\nHanseatic Inspiration\n2019\n2019\n230\nHanseatic Nature\n2019\n2019\n230\nEuropa 2\n2013\n2013\n500\nEuropa\n1999\n1999\n400\nTotal \n149,805\n__________________________________________________________________\n(1)\nThe year a ship entered service refers to the year in which the ship commenced cruise revenue operations for the brand.

Demand is typically strongest for cruises during the Northern Hemisphere\u2019s summer months and holidays. In order to mitigate the impact of the winter weather in the Northern Hemisphere and to capitalize on the summer season in the Southern Hemisphere, our brands have focused on deployment in the Caribbean, Asia and Australia during that period.\nPassengers and Capacity\nSelected statistical information is shown in the following table (see \nFinancial Presentation\n- \nDescription of Certain Line Items\n and \nSelected Operational and Financial Metrics\n under Item 7. \nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n, for definitions). \nPassengers Carried, Passenger Cruise Days, Available Passenger Cruise Days\n and\n Occupancy\n reflect the impact of our suspension of operations during parts of 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the gradual resumption of operations during the second half of 2021: \nYear Ended December\u00a031, (3)\n2021(1)(3) \n2020(2)\n2019 (2)\n2018 (2)\n2017\nPassengers Carried\n1,030,403\n1,295,144\n6,553,865\n6,084,201\n5,768,496\nPassenger Cruise Days\n5,802,582\n8,697,893\n44,803,953\n41,853,052\n40,033,527\nAvailable Passenger Cruise Days (APCD)\n11,767,441\n8,539,903\n41,432,451\n38,425,304\n36,930,939\nOccupancy\n49.3%\n101.9%\n108.1%\n108.9%\n108.4%\n___________________________________________________________________\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Due to the elimination of the Silversea Cruises three-month reporting lag in October of 2021, we include Silversea Cruises' metrics from October 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021 and October 1 through December 31, 2021 in the year ended December 31, 2021. The year ended December 31, 2021 does not include July, August, and September 2021 statistics as Silversea Cruises' results of operations for those months are included within \nOther (expense) income\n in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 1. General to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on the three-month reporting lag.\n(2)          Due to the three-month reporting lag effective through September 30, 2021, we include Silversea Cruises' metrics from October 1, 2019 through September 30, 2020 in the year ended December 31, 2020, from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019 in the year ended December 31, 2019, and from August 1, 2018 through September 30, 2018 in the year ended December 31, 2018.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the year ended December, 31, 2021, we include Azamara Cruises' metrics through March 19, 2021, the effective sale date of the brand. Refer to Note 1. General to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on the sale of the Azamara Cruises brand.\nCruise Pricing\nOur cruise ticket prices include accommodations and a wide variety of activities and amenities, including meals and entertainment. Prices vary depending on many factors including the destination, cruise length, stateroom category selected and the time of year the cruise takes place. In response to COVID-19, we established flexible cruise pricing programs (i.e. Cruise with Confidence, Best Price Guarantee and all-inclusive pricing) that present our guests with options and value.\nAlthough we grant credit terms in select markets mainly outside of the United States, our payment terms generally require an upfront deposit to confirm a reservation, with the balance due prior to the sailing. Our cruises are generally available for sale at least one year in advance and often more than two years in advance of sailing. During the selling period of a cruise, we continually monitor and adjust our cruise ticket prices for available guest staterooms based on demand, with the objective of maximizing net yields. \nAs our business has grown globally, our sale arrangements with travel advisors may vary. For instance, although our direct business has historically grown at a rapid pace, sale arrangements through travel advisor charter and group sales are proportionately higher in the China market than in our other markets which are primarily through retail agency and direct sales.\nWe have developed and implemented enhancements to our reservations system that provide us and our travel partners with additional capabilities, making it easier to do business with us. For example, we offer air transportation to our guests through our air transportation program available in major cities around the world. \nPassenger ticket revenues accounted for approximately 61%, 68% and 72% of total revenues in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOnboard Activities and Other Revenues\nOur cruise brands offer modern fleets with a wide array of onboard services, amenities and activities which vary by brand and ship. While many onboard activities are included in the base price of a cruise, we realize additional revenues from, among other things, gaming, the sale of alcoholic and other beverages, Internet and other telecommunication services, gift shop items, shore excursions, photography, spa/salon and fitness services, art auctions, retail shops and a wide variety of specialty restaurants and dining options. Many of these services are available for pre-booking prior to embarkation. These activities are offered either directly by us or by independent concessionaires from which we receive a percentage of their revenues. The all-inclusive pricing programs that we offer currently, add some of these onboard activity and other services to the base price of the cruise. \n13\nTable of Contents\nIn conjunction with our cruise vacations, we offer pre- and post-cruise hotel packages to our Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises guests. We also offer cruise vacation protection coverage to guests in a number of markets, which provides guests with coverage for trip cancellation, medical protection and baggage protection. Onboard and other revenues accounted for approximately 39%, 32% and 28% of total revenues in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nSegment Reporting\nWe control and operate three cruise brands, Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, and Silversea Cruises. In addition, we have a 50% joint venture interest in TUIC, our 50%-owned joint venture that operates the German brands TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises. We believe our brands possess the versatility to enter multiple cruise market segments within the cruise vacation industry. Although each of our brands has its own marketing style as well as ships and crews of various sizes, the nature of the products sold and services delivered by our brands share a common base (i.e., the sale and provision of cruise vacations). Our brands also have similar itineraries as well as similar cost and revenue components. In addition, our brands source passengers from similar markets around the world and operate in similar economic environments with a significant degree of commercial overlap. As a result, our brands have been aggregated as a single reportable segment based on the similarity of their economic characteristics, types of consumers, regulatory environment, maintenance requirements, supporting systems and processes as well as products and services provided. Our President and Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the chief operating decision-maker and all significant operating decisions including the allocation of resources are based upon the analyses of the Company as one segment. \n(\nFor financial information, see Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n.)\nHuman Capital\nOur human capital strategy focuses on attracting, developing and retaining the best talent in the industry. Some key elements of these strategies include: assessing current and future talent needs; a diverse and inclusive workforce; robust opportunities for employee growth and development; support for health and well-being; and an active listening strategy to make sure voices are heard and continuous improvement occurs. We review our human capital metrics and our diversity equity and inclusion (DEI) program with the Talent and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors on an annual basis.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our three global cruise brands, Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, and Silversea Cruises, employed approximately 85,000 employees spanning across our shipboard fleet and shoreside locations. Our shoreside workforce, including private destinations, consisted of approximately 7,600 full time and 100 part-time employees. Our shipboard workforce consisted of 77,000 employees, and as of December 31, 2021,  approximately 86%  were covered by collective bargaining agreements.\nThe following table details the distribution of our workforce by employee type and region as of December 31, 2021:\nEmployee Type\n(1)\nU.S. Based Employees \nInternational Employees \nShoreside Operations \n4,100\n2,500\nShipboard Employees \n\u00a0\n77,000\nPrivate Destinations\n(2)\n \n\u00a0\n1,100\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Includes full time and part time employees. \n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Private Destinations includes Coco Cay, Labadee and Galapagos based employees.\nAs a global operation, we take great pride in the broad diversity of our workforce and the value it brings to our company. Our shoreside workforce is gender diverse with 53% female representation. Our shipboard workforce is comprised of employees from 130 plus countries. The majority of our shipboard workforce comes from the Philippines (28%), Indonesia (16%) and India (14%). Our shoreside workforce is primarily based out of the U.S. (62%), Philippines (17%), U.K. (5%),  Mexico (5%), and China (3%).  \n14\nTable of Contents\nThe following table details the gender distribution of our workforce by employee location as of December 31, 2021:\nEmployee Location \nMale \nFemale \nShoreside - U.S. \n42%\n58%\nShoreside - International \n52%\n48%\nShipboard \n78%\n22%\nOur U.S. shoreside workforce is ethnically diverse with 54% comprised of non-White ethnic groups. \nU.S. Shoreside Representation by Ethnicity \n% of Total U.S. Shoreside Population \nWhite \n46%\nHispanic \n38%\nAfrican American \n11%\nAsian \n5%\nOthers\n(1)\n\u2014%\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Others category is greater than 0% but less than 1%.\nWe offer a variety of learning and development programs to our workforce which includes a combination of instructor led (classroom and virtual) and web based (self-learning) courses. In 2021, our workforce invested approximately 620,000 hours in learning programs across a variety of areas ranging from Ethics, Compliance, Data Analysis, Business Software and Tools, Finance/Accounting, Professional development, Project Management skills, Leadership and Safety/Security. In total, our workforce completed over 400,000 courses within our learning management systems. During 2021, we also coached over 500 leaders across our shipboard and shoreside populations (421 Shipboard; 110 Shoreside), as part of our plans for a healthy return to service. \nDuring 2021, we focused on our global healthy return to sailing and on bringing our crew back on board our ships. As part of our healthy return to sailing, we determined to establish a highly vaccinated environment. We returned 37,000 crew from various countries and made vaccines available to all returning crew members through partnerships with various world governments. By the end of 2021, we operated 85% of our fleet's capacity, with 100% vaccinated crew back on board.  \n In the third quarter of 2021, we welcomed our shoreside employees back to our headquarters in Miami and other locations around the world. Employees returned to our offices with robust protocols that promote their health and safety. We continue to run our employee pulse surveys every quarter to understand and positively impact our employees\u2019 experience. In 2021, our shoreside employee engagement scores remained high and above most global industry benchmarks.\nInsurance \nWe maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships, with insured values generally equal to the net book value of each ship. This coverage is maintained with reputable insurance underwriters from the British, Scandinavian, French, United States and other reputable international insurance markets.\nWe are members of four Protection and Indemnity (\"P&I\") clubs, which are part of a worldwide group of 13 P&I clubs, known as the International Group of P&I Clubs (the \u201cIG\u201d). Liabilities, costs and expenses for illness and injury to crew, guest injury, pollution and other third-party claims in connection with our cruise activities are covered by our P&I clubs, subject to the clubs\u2019 rules and the limits of coverage determined by the IG. P&I coverage provided by the clubs is on a mutual basis and we are subject to additional premium calls in the event of a catastrophic loss incurred by any member of the 13 P&I clubs, whereby the reinsurance limits purchased by the IG are exhausted. We are also subject to additional premium calls based on investment and underwriting shortfalls experienced by our own individual insurers.\nWe maintain war risk insurance for legal liability to crew, guests and other third parties as well as for loss or damage to our vessels arising from acts of war, including invasion, insurrection, terrorism, rebellion, piracy and hijacking. Our primary war risk coverage is provided by a Norwegian war risk insurance association and our excess war risk insurance is provided by our four P&I clubs. Consistent with most marine war risk policies, our coverage is subject to cancellation in the event of a change in risk. In the event of a war between major powers, our primary policies terminate after thirty days\u2019 \n15\nTable of Contents\nnotice and our excess policies terminate immediately. Our excess policies are also subject to cancellation after a notice period of seven days in the event of other changes in risk. These notice periods allow for premiums to be renegotiated based on changes in risk.\nInsurance coverage for other exposures, such as shoreside property and casualty, passenger off-vessel, directors and officers and network security and privacy, are maintained with various global insurance companies.\nWe do not carry business interruption insurance for our ships based on our evaluation of the risks involved and protective measures already in place, as compared to the cost of insurance.\nAll insurance coverage is subject to certain limitations, exclusions and deductible levels. In addition, in certain circumstances, we either self-insure or co-insure a portion of these risks. Premiums charged by insurance carriers, including carriers in the maritime insurance industry, increase or decrease from time to time and tend to be cyclical in nature. These cycles are impacted both by our own loss experience and by losses incurred in direct and reinsurance markets. We historically have been able to obtain insurance coverage in amounts and at premiums we have deemed to be commercially acceptable. No assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will be available to us in the future, particularly for war risk insurance. \nTrademarks\nWe own a number of registered trademarks related to the Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises cruise brands. The registered trademarks include the name \u201cRoyal Caribbean International\u201d and its crown and anchor logo, the name \u201cCelebrity Cruises\u201d and its \u201cX\u201d logo, the name \u201cSilversea Cruises\u201d and its logo, and the names of various cruise ships, ship venues and other marketing programs. We believe our largest brands' trademarks are widely recognized throughout the world and have considerable value. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.\nRegulation \nOur ships are regulated by various international, national, state and local laws, regulations and treaties in force in the jurisdictions in which they operate. In addition, our ships are registered in the Bahamas, Malta or in the case of our ships operating in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador. Each ship is subject to regulations issued by its country of registry, including regulations issued pursuant to international treaties governing the safety of our ships, guests and crew as well as environmental protection. Each country of registry conducts periodic inspections to verify compliance with these regulations as discussed more fully below. Ships operating out of ports of call around the world are also subject to inspection by the maritime authorities of that country for compliance with international treaties and local regulations. Additionally, ships operating out of the United States ports are subject to inspection by the United States Coast Guard for compliance with international treaties and by the United States Public Health Service for sanitary and health conditions. Our ships are also subject to similar inspections pursuant to the laws and regulations of various other countries our ships visit. \nWe believe that we are in material compliance with all the regulations applicable to our ships and that we have all licenses necessary to conduct our business. Health, safety, security, environmental and financial responsibility issues are, and we believe will continue to be, an area of focus by the relevant government authorities in the United States and internationally. From time to time, various regulatory and legislative changes may be implemented that could impact our operations and subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future.\nCDC COVID-19 Program for Cruise Ships Operating in U.S. Waters\nBeginning in October 2020, our ships home porting or calling in U.S. ports operated under a Framework for Conditional Sailing Order (\u201cCSO\u201d) issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC\") that permitted cruise ship passenger operations in U.S. waters subject to certain conditions and safety protocols. The CSO, which had been modified over time, expired on January 15, 2022. On February 9, 2022, the CDC published a COVID-19 program (the \u201cProgram\u201d) for cruise vessels sailing in U.S. waters.  Under the Program, persons traveling on cruise ships designated as \u201cHighly Vaccinated\u201d do not have to wear a mask in any areas onboard and are not subject to physical distancing protocols. Cruise lines may opt into the Program on a voluntary basis Cruise lines may also opt out at any time. We have voluntarily opted-in to the CDC\u2019s Program beginning with sailings departing on or after February 25, 2022, and have designated all ships across our brands as \u201cHighly Vaccinated\u201d vessels. Going forward, the CDC may issue additional recommendations or requirements through technical instructions to the Program.  We plan to continue to monitor and evaluate any further CDC guidance based on our assessment of then-current epidemiological conditions, and applicable health and safety protocols.\n16\nTable of Contents\nSafety and Security Regulations\nOur ships are required to comply with international safety standards defined in the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea (\u201cSOLAS\u201d), which, among other things, establish requirements for ship design, structural features, materials, construction, lifesaving equipment and safe management and operation of ships for guest and crew safety. The SOLAS standards are revised from time to time and incorporated in our ship design and operation, as applicable. The latest enhancements include the addition of the Polar Code which sets goal-based standards for ships operating in the polar region as well as damage stability requirements for new designs and operational measures for existing vessels. Compliance with these modified standards have not historically had a material effect on our operating costs. SOLAS incorporates the International Safety Management Code (\u201cISM Code\u201d), which provides an international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for pollution prevention. The ISM Code is mandatory for all vessels, including passenger vessel operators. \nAll of our operations and ships are regularly audited by various national authorities, and we are required to maintain the relevant certificates of compliance with the ISM Code.\nOur ships are subject to various security requirements, including the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (\u201cISPS Code\u201d), which is part of SOLAS, and the U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (\u201cMTSA\u201d), which applies to ships that operate in U.S. ports.  In order to satisfy these security requirements, we implement security measures, conduct vessel security assessments, and develop security plans. The security plans for all of our ships have been submitted to and approved by the Recognized Security Organization on behalf of the ships' flag state and are in compliance with the ISPS Code and the MTSA. \nThe Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act of 2010, which applies to passenger vessels which embark or include port stops within the United States, requires the implementation of certain safety design features as well as the establishment of practices for the reporting of and dealing with allegations of crime. The cruise industry supported this legislation and we believe that our internal standards are generally as strict or stricter than the law requires. Some provisions of the act call for regulations which have not been finalized. We do not expect the pending regulations will have a material impact to our operations.\nEnvironmental Regulations\nWe are subject to various international and national laws and regulations relating to environmental protection. Under such laws and regulations, we are generally prohibited from discharging materials other than food waste into the waterways. We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. From time to time, environmental and other regulators consider more stringent regulations, which may affect our operations and increase our compliance costs. We believe that the impact of ships on the global environment will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world and, accordingly, may subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future, including the items described below.\nOur ships are subject to the International Maritime Organization\u2019s (\u2018\u2018IMO\u2019\u2019) regulations under the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (the \u2018\u2018MARPOL Regulations\u2019\u2019) and the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships Ballast Water and Sediments (Ballast Water Management Convention), in addition to other regional and national regulations such as EU Directives and the US Vessel General Permit, which includes requirements designed to minimize pollution by oil, sewage, garbage, air emissions and the transfer of non-native/non-indigenous species. We have obtained the relevant international compliance certificates relating to oil, sewage, air pollution prevention and ballast water for all of our ships. \nThe MARPOL Regulations imposed reduced global limitations on the sulfur content of emissions emitted by ships operating worldwide to 0.5% as of January 1, 2020, which was reduced from 3.5%. As we continue our gradual resumption of operations, we do not expect for this increased limitation to have a material impact to our results of operations largely due to a number of mitigating steps we have taken over the last several years, including equipping all of our new ships delivered during or after 2014 with Advanced Emissions Purification (\"AEP\") systems covering all engines and actively developing and installing AEP systems on the majority of our remaining fleet resulting in 70% of our fleet being equipped with AEP systems.\nThe MARPOL Regulations also establish special Emission Control Areas (\"ECAs\") with additional stringent limitations on sulfur emissions in these areas. There are four established ECAs that restrict sulfur emissions: the Baltic Sea, the North Sea/English Channel, certain waters surrounding the North American coast, and the waters surrounding Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (the \"Caribbean ECA\"). Ships operating in these sulfur ECAs have been required to \n17\nTable of Contents\nreduce their emissions sulfur content to 0.1%. This reduction has not had a significant impact on our results of operations to date due to the mitigating steps described above. \nWe continue to implement our AEP system strategy for both our ships on order and our existing fleet. As our new ships are delivered with AEP systems, or other mitigating technologies (Liquified Natural Gas (\"LNG\") fuels, fuel cells, etc.), and additional existing ships are retrofitted with AEP systems, they will provide us with additional operational and deployment flexibility. \nAdditionally, all new ships operating within the North American and U.S. Caribbean Sea ECA that began construction on or after January 1, 2016, and North and Baltic Sea ships constructed on or after January 1, 2021 are required to meet more stringent nitrogen oxide emission limits. We comply with these rules for those relevant ships in service. As an added measure, all of our ships under construction are being built to comply with these rules. The rules have not had and are not expected to have a significant impact to our operations or costs. \nIn November of 2020, IMO approved amendments to the MARPOL convention that will require ships, beginning in 2023, to combine a technical and an operational approach (Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (\"EEXI\") and Carbon Intensity Indicator (\"CII\")) to reduce their carbon intensity in line with the ambition of the Initial IMO GHG Strategy which aims to reduce carbon intensity of international shipping by 40% by 2030, compared to 2008. While there is still work to be completed ahead of these amendments being implemented, the approved framework for the EEXI amendment is not expected to have a material impact on our operations. However, the framework for CII could have a negative impact on our itinerary flexibility for certain of our ships depending on the final operational measures needed to comply. \nEffective July 1, 2015, the European Commission adopted legislation that requires cruise ship operators with ships visiting ports in the European Union to monitor and report on the ship\u2019s annual carbon dioxide emissions starting in 2018. Additionally, in 2019, the IMO's monitoring and reporting system (IMO data and collection system), which is applicable to all ship itineraries, entered into force. While compliance with these regulations did not materially impact our costs or results of operations, the legislations contemplate further obligations and restrictions which could ultimately result in additional costs or charges associated with carbon dioxide emissions. \nThe IMO Ballast Water Management Convention, which came into effect in 2017, requires ships that carry and discharge ballast water to meet specific discharge standards by installing Ballast Water Treatment Systems by 2023. Compliance with this regulation has not had a material effect on our results of operations and we do not expect the continuing compliance with this regulation to have a material effect on our results of operations. \nRefer to Item 1A. \nRisk Factors - \"Environmental, labor, health and safety, financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase costs\" \nfor further discussion of the risks associated with the regulations discussed above\n. \nConsumer Financial Responsibility Regulations \nWe are required to obtain certificates from the United States Federal Maritime Commission relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of non-performance of obligations to guests, as well as casualty and personal injury. As a condition to obtaining the required certificates, we generally arrange through our insurers for the provision of surety for our ship-operating companies. The required amount is currently $32.0 million per operator and is subject to additional consumer price index based adjustments. \nWe are also required by the United Kingdom, Norway, Finland and the Baltics to establish our financial responsibility for any liability resulting from the non-performance of our obligations to guests from these jurisdictions.  In the United Kingdom we are currently required by the Association of British Travel Agents to provide performance bonds totaling approximately \u00a3124 million. Additionally, we were required by the Civil Aviation Authority to provide performance bonds totaling \u00a318.5 million. The Norwegian Travel Guarantee Fund requires us to maintain performance bonds in varying amounts during the course of the year to cover our financial responsibility in Norway, Finland and the Baltics.\nCertain other jurisdictions also require that we establish financial responsibility to our guests resulting from the non-performance of our obligations; however, the related amounts do not have a material effect on our costs. \nTaxation of the Company\nThe following is a summary of our principal taxes, exemptions and special regimes. In addition to or instead of income taxation, virtually all jurisdictions where our ships call impose some tax or fee, or both, based on guest headcount, tonnage or some other measure. We also collect and remit value added tax (VAT) or sales tax in many jurisdictions where \n18\nTable of Contents\nwe operate.\nOur consolidated operations are primarily foreign corporations engaged in the owning and operating of passenger cruise ships in international transportation. \nU.S. Income Taxation \nThe following is a discussion of the application of the U.S. federal and state income tax laws to us and is based on the current provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, Treasury Department regulations, administrative rulings, court decisions and the relevant state tax laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions of the states where we have business operations. All of the foregoing is subject to change, and any such change could affect the accuracy of this discussion.\nApplication of Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., Celebrity Cruises, Inc. and Silversea Cruises Ltd. are engaged in a trade or business in the United States, and many of our ship-owning subsidiaries, depending upon the itineraries of their ships, receive income from sources within the United States. Silversea Cruises Ltd. and our United Kingdom tonnage tax company are classified as disregarded entities, or divisions for U.S. federal income tax purposes that may earn U.S. source income. Under Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code, certain foreign corporations may exclude from gross income (and effectively from branch profits tax as such earnings do not give rise to effectively connected earnings and profits) U.S. source income derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships, including income from the leasing of such ships. \nA foreign corporation will qualify for the benefits of Section 883 if, in relevant part: (1) the foreign country in which the foreign corporation is organized grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the United States; and (2) the stock of the corporation (or the direct or indirect corporate parent thereof) is \u201cprimarily and regularly traded on an established securities market\u201d in the United States. In the opinion of our U.S. tax counsel, Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP, based on the representations and assumptions set forth in that opinion, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., including Silversea Cruises Ltd., Celebrity Cruises Inc., and relevant ship-owning subsidiaries with U.S. source shipping income qualify for the benefits of Section 883 because Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and each of those subsidiaries are incorporated in Liberia, which is a qualifying country, and our common stock is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the United States (i.e., we are a \u201cpublicly traded\u201d corporation). If, in the future, (1) Liberia no longer qualifies as an equivalent exemption jurisdiction, and we do not reincorporate in a jurisdiction that does qualify for the exemption, or (2) we fail to qualify as a publicly traded corporation, we and all of our ship-owning or operating subsidiaries that rely on Section 883 to exclude qualifying income from gross income would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on their U.S. source shipping income and income from activities incidental thereto. \nWe believe that most of our income and the income of our ship-owning subsidiaries, is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships and, therefore, is exempt from taxation under Section 883. \nRegulations under Section 883 list activities that are not considered by the Internal Revenue Service to be incidental to the international operation of ships including the sale of air and land transportation, shore excursions and pre- and post-cruise tours. Our income from these activities that is earned from sources within the United States will be subject to U.S. taxation.  \nTaxation in the Absence of an Exemption Under Section 883 \nIf Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., the operator of our vessels, Celebrity Cruises Inc., or our ship-owning subsidiaries were to fail to meet the requirements of Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code, or if the provision was repealed, then, as explained below, such companies would be subject to U.S. income taxation on a portion of their income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships.\nBecause Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Celebrity Cruises Inc. conduct a trade or business in the United States, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., including Silversea Cruises Ltd., and Celebrity Cruises Inc. would be taxable at regular corporate rates on our separate company taxable income (i.e., without regard to the income of our ship-owning subsidiaries) on income which is effectively connected with our U.S. trade or business (generally only income from U.S. sources). In addition, if any of our earnings and profits effectively connected with our U.S. trade or business were withdrawn, or were deemed to have been withdrawn, from our U.S. trade or business, those withdrawn amounts would be subject to a \u201cbranch profits\u201d tax at the rate of 30%. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., which includes Silversea Cruises Ltd. for tax purposes, and Celebrity Cruises Inc. would also be potentially subject to tax on portions of certain interest paid by us at rates of up to 30%.\n19\nTable of Contents\nIf Section 883 were not available to our ship-owning subsidiaries, each such subsidiary would be subject to a special 4% tax on its U.S. source gross transportation income, if any, each year because it does not have a fixed place of business in the United States and its income is derived from the leasing of a ship.\nOther United States Taxation\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., which includes Silversea Cruises Ltd., and Celebrity Cruises Inc. earn U.S. source income from activities not considered incidental to international shipping. The tax on such income is not material to our results of operation for all years presented. \nState Taxation\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., Celebrity Cruises Inc., and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various U.S. state income taxes which are generally imposed on each state\u2019s portion of the U.S. source income subject to federal income taxes.  Additionally, the state of Alaska subjects an allocated portion of the total income of companies doing business in Alaska and certain other affiliated companies to Alaska corporate state income taxes and also imposes a 33% tax on adjusted gross income from onboard gambling activities conducted in Alaska waters. This did not have a material impact to our results of operations for all years presented.\nUnited Kingdom Income Taxation\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we operated 17 ships under the United Kingdom tonnage tax regime (\u201cU.K. tonnage tax\u201d).  \nCompanies subject to U.K. tonnage tax pay a corporate tax on a notional profit determined with reference to the net tonnage of qualifying vessels. The requirements for a company to qualify for the U.K. tonnage tax regime include being subject to U.K. corporate income tax, operating qualifying ships, which are strategically and commercially managed in the United Kingdom, and fulfilling a seafarer training requirement.\nRelevant shipping profits include income from the operation of qualifying ships and from shipping related activities. Our U.K. income from non-shipping activities which do not qualify under the U.K. tonnage tax regime and which are not considered significant, remain subject to regular U.K. corporate income tax. \nOther Taxation\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to value-added and other indirect taxes most of which are reclaimable, zero-rated or exempt. \nWebsite Access to Reports\nWe make available, free of charge, access to our Annual Reports, all quarterly and current reports and all amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission through our website at \nwww.rclinvestor.com\n.

Risk Factors\nThe risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historical results. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks. There may be additional risks that we consider not to be material, or which are not known, and any of these risks could affect our operations.\n\u00a0\nThe ordering of the risk factors set forth below is not intended to reflect a risk's potential likelihood or magnitude. See Item\u00a07. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements.\nCOVID-19 and Financial Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and liquidity. The global spread of COVID-19, the unprecedented responses by governments and other authorities to control and contain the disease, including related variants and challenges to global vaccination efforts, have caused significant disruptions, created new risks, and exacerbated existing risks to our business.\nWe have been, and continue to be, negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including impacts that resulted or may result from actions taken in response to the outbreak and the occurrence and spread of related variants. Examples of these include, but are not limited to, cruising advisories and required or voluntary travel restrictions, that resulted in the temporary suspension of our Global Brands' operations, from which we have resumed limited operations; restrictions on the movement and gathering of people; social distancing measures; shelter-in-place/stay-at-home orders; and disruptions to businesses in our supply chain. In addition to the restrictions affecting our business, the extent, duration, and magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s effect on the economy and consumer demand for cruising and travel is evolving and difficult to predict. As such, these impacts may persist for an extended period of time or even become more pronounced, even as we resume operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also has elevated risks affecting significant parts of our business:\n\u2022 \nOperations:\n While we have restarted our global cruise operations in a phased manner, following the March 2020 suspension of our global cruise operations, there is no assurance that our plan to resume operations will be successful. It is possible that future COVID-19 cases could occur onboard and, even if controlled and contained, it is uncertain whether we will need to suspend additional sailings and to what extent in such event. Onboard cases have resulted in illness among our guests and crew, incremental costs, guest refunds and negative publicity and media attention. In addition, we may face challenges in executing our return to service plans as a result of new and evolving operating protocols, including due to state laws regarding proof of vaccination requirements and related litigation, and possible changes in regulations in the countries in which we operate and plan to operate. \nUncertainties remain as to the specifics, timing and costs of administering and implementing our health and safety measures, some of which may be significant. These measures also may negatively impact guest satisfaction. Based on our assessment of these requirements and recommendations, the status of COVID-19 infection and/or vaccination rates in the U.S. or globally or for other reasons, we may determine it necessary to cancel or modify certain of our Global Brands\u2019 cruise sailings. In addition, there is no guarantee that the vaccines will be effective. We believe the impact to our global bookings resulting from COVID-19 will continue to have a material negative impact on our results of operations and liquidity, which may be prolonged beyond containment of the disease and its variants.\nOur previous suspension of sailings and our gradual resumption of operations has led to a significant decline in our revenues and cash inflows, which required us to take cost and capital expenditure containment actions. Consequently, we reduced and furloughed some of our workforce, with approximately 23% of our U.S. shoreside employee base being impacted in 2020. Our ships and our shipboard crew are gradually being notified about new assignments as operations resume over time. We may be challenged in rebuilding the rest of our workforce which could delay our phased resumption of operations. In addition, we have reduced our planned capital spending through 2022, which may negatively impact or delay our execution of planned growth strategies, particularly as it relates to investments in our ships, technology, and our expansion of land-based developments. We also have taken actions to monitor and mitigate changes in our supply chain, and port destination availability, which may strain relationships with our vendors and port partners.\nIf we are unable to satisfy the safety standards applicable to our sailings, our operations may be negatively impacted and we could be exposed to reputational and legal risks. Due to the unprecedented and uncertain nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and related regulatory landscape, it is difficult to predict the impact of further disruptions and their magnitude. In addition, we have never previously experienced a complete cessation of our cruising operations or a subsequent phased resumption of operations, and as a consequence, we are unable to predict the precise impact of such a cessation or phased resumption of operations on our brands and future prospects.\n\u2022\nResults of Operations:\n Our suspensions of sailings have materially impacted the results of our operations. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs as we accommodate passengers due to cancelled sailings. In addition, we have \nincurred and will likely continue to incur significant overhead costs associated with the return to service of our fleet and enhanced COVID-19 related cleaning, testing, vaccination and other mitigation procedures. We may experience volatility in demand for cruising for an indeterminable length of time due to the uncertain nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing concerns about health and safety, and we cannot predict when we will return to pre-pandemic demand or fare pricing or if we will return to such levels in the foreseeable future. In turn, these negative impacts to our financial performance have resulted and may continue to result in impairments of our long-lived and intangible assets, which has influenced our decision making relating to early disposal, sale or retirement of assets. Following the resumption of operations, our Global Brands and our Partner Brands may be subject to the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Additionally, any future profitability will be impacted by increased debt service costs as a result of our liquidity actions.\n\u2022\nLiquidity: \nThe suspension of our sailings and the reduction in demand for future cruising adversely impacted our liquidity, and we have continued to experience higher than historical levels of refunds of customer deposits, while cash inflows from new or existing bookings on future sailings are below pre-pandemic levels. As a result, we have taken actions to increase our liquidity through a combination of operating and capital expense reductions and increased financing activities. Refer to Note 8. \nDebt\n to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplemental Data\n for further discussion of our 2021 financing activities.\nWe have agreed with certain of our lenders that we will not pay dividends or engage in stock repurchases until after the  third quarter of 2022. Thereafter, in the event we declare a dividend or engage in stock repurchases we will need to repay the amounts deferred under our export credit facilities. On February 25, 2021, S&P Global further downgraded our senior unsecured rating from B+ to B, which had no financial impact, and downgraded our Senior Secured Notes which were partially repaid in August 2021, and Silversea Notes, which were fully repaid in June 2021 with the proceeds from the $650 million June Unsecured Notes, from BB to BB-. This downgrade had no impact on the terms of the notes. Our ability to raise additional financing, whether or not secured, could be limited if our credit rating is further downgraded, and/or if we fail to comply with applicable covenants governing our outstanding indebtedness, and/or if overall financial market conditions worsen. Additionally, due to the complexity of the pandemic\u2019s impact to the economy and uncertainty of its duration, we cannot guarantee that assumptions used to project our liquidity needs will be correct, which may result in the need for additional financing and/or may result in the inability to satisfy covenants required by our current credit facilities. If we continue to raise additional funds through equity or convertible debt issuances, our shareholders could experience dilution of their ownership interest, and these equity or convertible debt securities could have rights, preferences, and privileges that are superior to that of holders of our ordinary shares. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to additional limitations on our operations due to restrictive covenants, which may be more restrictive than the covenants in our existing debt agreements, and we may be required to further encumber our assets. Also, as a result of our additional debt issuances, we will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain operations. Our ability to generate cash depends on factors beyond our control and we may be unable to repay or repurchase debt at maturity. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to fund our operations, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could negatively affect our business. There is no guarantee that financing will be available in the future or that such financing will be available with similar terms or terms that are commercially acceptable to us. Further, if any government agrees to provide us with disaster relief assistance, or other assistance due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we determine it is beneficial to seek such government assistance, it may impose restrictions on share buybacks, dividends, prepayment of debt, executive compensation or other areas of our business until the aid is repaid or redeemed in full, which could significantly limit our corporate activities and adversely impact our business and operations. We cannot assure you that any such disaster relief would be available to us.\nWe may not be able to obtain sufficient financing or capital for our needs or may not be able to do so on terms that are acceptable or consistent with our expectations.\nTo fund our capital expenditures (including new ship orders), operations and scheduled debt payments, we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations, drawdowns under available credit facilities, the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sale of equity or debt securities in private or public securities markets. Any circumstance or event which leads to a decrease in consumer cruise spending, such as worsening global economic conditions or significant incidents impacting the cruise industry, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, negatively affects our operating cash flows. We had net cash outflows from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. As result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting suspension of our operations, we have experienced credit rating downgrades, which may reduce our ability to incur secured indebtedness by reducing the amount of indebtedness that we are permitted to secure, and may negatively impact our access to, and cost of, debt financing.  \nOur ability to access additional funding as and when needed, our ability to timely refinance and/or replace our outstanding debt securities and credit facilities on acceptable terms and our cost of funding will depend upon numerous factors including, but not limited to, the strength of the financial markets, our recovery and financial performance, the recovery and performance of our industry in general and the size, scope and timing of our financial needs. In addition, even where financing commitments have been secured, \nsignificant disruptions in the capital and credit markets could cause our banking and other counterparties to breach their contractual obligations to us or could cause the conditions to the availability of such funding not to be satisfied. This could include failures of banks or other financial service companies to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements or to pay us amounts that may become due or return collateral that is refundable under our derivative contracts for hedging of fuel prices, interest rates and foreign currencies or other agreements. If any of the foregoing occurs for a prolonged period of time it will have a long-term negative impact on our cash flows and our ability to meet our financial obligations.\nOur substantial debt requires a significant amount of cash to service and could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt and significant debt service obligations. As of December\u00a031, 2021, we had total debt of $21.1 billion. Our substantial debt has required us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow from operations to service debt and fund repayments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate expenses. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nOur ability to make future scheduled payments on our debt service obligations or refinance our debt depends on our future operating and financial performance and ability to generate cash. This will be affected by our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond our control, such as the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. If we cannot generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service obligations or fund our other business needs, we may, among other things, need to refinance all or a portion of our debt, obtain additional financing, delay planned capital expenditures or sell assets. We cannot assure that we will be able to generate sufficient cash through any of the foregoing. If we are not able to refinance any of our debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt.\nOur substantial debt could also result in other negative consequences for us. For example, it could increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industry in which we operate; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, the economy or the industry in which we operate, including the current downturn related to COVID-19; limit our ability to raise additional debt or equity capital in the future to satisfy our requirements relating to working capital, capital expenditures, development projects, strategic initiatives or other purposes; restrict us from making strategic acquisitions, introducing new technologies or exploiting business opportunities; limit or restrict our ability to obtain and maintain performance bonds to cover our financial responsibility requirements in various jurisdictions for non-performance of guest travel, casualty and personal injury; make it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt; and increase our exposure to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are (and may be in the future) at a variable rate of interest. \nDespite our leverage, we may incur more debt, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Except for the restrictions under the indentures governing our 10.875% and 11.5% senior secured notes due 2023 and 2025, respectively (the \u201cSecured Notes\u201d), and our 9.125% senior guaranteed notes due 2023 (the \u201cPriority Guaranteed  Notes\u201d) and certain of our other debt instruments, including our unsecured bank and export credit facilities, we are not restricted under the terms of our debt instruments from incurring additional debt. Although the indentures governing the Secured Notes, the Unsecured Notes, and certain of our other debt instruments, including our unsecured bank and export credit facilities, contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances the amount of debt that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. In the event that we execute and borrow under the $700.0\u00a0million commitment available to draw on at any time prior to August 12, 2022 for a 364-day term loan facility, the credit agreement that would govern such term loan facility would impose substantially similar restrictions (including the related qualifications and exceptions) as are set forth in the indenture governing the Unsecured Notes. If new debt is added to our existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. As of December\u00a031, 2021, we have commitments for approximately $10.0 billion of debt to finance the purchase of 9 ships on order by our Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea Cruises brands, all of which are guaranteed by the export credit agencies in the countries in which the ships are being built. The ultimate size of each facility will depend on the final contract price (including change orders and owner\u2019s supply) as well as fluctuations in the EUR/USD exchange rate. \nWe are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities. In addition, if we fail to comply with any of these restrictions, it could have a material adverse effect on us. \nCertain of our debt instruments, including our indentures and our unsecured bank and export credit facilities, limit our flexibility in operating our business. For example, certain of our loan agreements and indentures restrict or limit our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; pay dividends or distributions on, or redeem or repurchase capital stock and make other restricted payments; make investments; consummate certain asset sales; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; grant or assume certain liens; and consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, both our \nexport credit facilities and our non-export credit facilities contain covenants that will, once our current waivers expire, require us, among other things, to maintain a specified minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and limit our net debt-to-capital ratio.  In addition, our ECA facility amendments also require us to maintain minimum liquidity and a minimum stock holders' equity. Refer to Note 8. Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data for further discussion on our covenants and existing waivers.\nAll of these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. Despite these exceptions and qualifications, we cannot assure you that the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in certain of our debt instruments will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest. Any future indebtedness may include similar or other restrictive terms. In addition, our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. These include prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If we breach any of these covenants or restrictions, we could be in default under such indebtedness and certain of our other debt instruments, and the relevant debt holders or lenders could elect to declare the debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, if any, immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that debt.  If the debt under certain of our debt instruments that we enter into were to be accelerated, our liquid assets may be insufficient to repay in full such indebtedness. Borrowings under other debt instruments that contain cross-default provisions also may be accelerated or become payable on demand. In these circumstances, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness then outstanding.\nIn addition, our ability to maintain our credit facilities may also be impacted by changes in our ownership base. More specifically, we may be required to prepay our non-ECA and ECA facilities if any person acquires ownership of more than 50% of our common stock or, subject to certain exceptions, during any 24-month period, a majority of our board of directors is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of our board of directors on the first day of such period. Our public debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by a third-party acquisition of greater than 50% of our common stock coupled with a ratings downgrade, which would require us to offer to repurchase our public debt securities in the event of such change of control. \nIf we elect to settle conversions of our convertible notes in shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, conversions of our convertible notes will result in dilution for our existing shareholders.\nWe have an aggregate principal amount of $1.725 billion in convertible notes outstanding. If note holders elect to convert, the notes will be converted into our shares of common stock, cash, or a combination of common stock and cash, at our discretion.  Prior to March 15 and August 15, 2023, our convertible notes issued June 2020 and October 2020, respectively, will be convertible at the option of holders during certain periods only upon satisfaction of certain conditions. Beyond those dates, the convertible notes will be convertible at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding their maturity date. Conversions of our convertible notes in shares of our common stock or a combination of common stock and cash, will result in dilution to our shareholders.\nWe did not declare quarterly dividends on our common stock in 2021 and do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. \nNo cash dividends were declared on our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2021. We expect that any income received from operations will be devoted to our future operations and recovery. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future due to our agreement with certain of our lenders not to pay dividends until the end of the third quarter of 2022. In addition, in the event we thereafter declare a dividend, we will need to repay our debt deferral. Payment of dividends would, in any case, depend upon our profitability at the time, cash available for those dividends, and other factors as our board of directors may consider relevant. \nIncreased regulatory oversight, and the phasing out of LIBOR may adversely affect the value of a portion of our indebtedness.\nThe publication of certain LIBOR settings ceased after December 31, 2021, and uncertainty regarding alternative reference rates remains as many market participants await a wider adoption of replacement products prior to the cessation of the remaining USD LIBOR tenors (currently scheduled for June 30, 2023). When LIBOR ceases to exist, the level of interest payments on the portion of our indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates might be affected if we, the agent, and/or the lenders holding a majority of the outstanding loans or commitments under such indebtedness fail to amend such indebtedness to implement a replacement rate. Regardless, such replacement rate will give due consideration to any evolving or then-existing conventions for similar credit facilities, which may result in different than expected interest payments.\nMacroeconomic, Business, Market and Operational Risks\nAdverse worldwide economic or other conditions could reduce the demand for cruises and passenger spending, adversely impacting our operating results, cash flows and financial condition including impairing the value of our goodwill, ships, \ntrademarks and other assets and potentially affecting other critical accounting estimates where the change may be material to our operating results.\nIn addition to health and safety concerns, demand for cruises is affected by international, national, and local economic conditions. Weak or uncertain economic conditions may impact consumer confidence and pose a risk as vacationers postpone or reduce discretionary spending. This, in turn, may result in cruise booking slowdowns, decreased cruise prices and lower onboard revenues. Given the global nature of our business, we are exposed to many different economies, and our business could be hurt by challenging conditions in any of our markets. Additionally, the continued impact of COVID-19 on the financial markets is uncertain and we cannot predict its effect on geopolitical events and/or international trade policies as countries attempt to mitigate the impact of the pandemic and as they re-open their economies or re-implement lockdown measures. \nOur operating costs could increase due to market forces and economic or geopolitical factors beyond our control.\nOur operating costs, including fuel, food, payroll and benefits, airfare, taxes, insurance, and security costs, can be and have been subject to increases due to market forces and economic or geopolitical conditions or other factors beyond our control, including  the global inflationary pressures that we are currently experiencing and that have increased our operating costs. In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we've incurred increased operating costs, including as a result of rerouting itineraries due to ports closing or not accepting passengers. Increases in these operating costs could adversely affect our future profitability.\nAny further impairment of our goodwill, long-lived assets, equity investments and notes receivable could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. A challenging operating environment (such as is currently being experienced due to the impact of COVID-19), conditions affecting consumer demand or spending, the deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions, or other factors could result in a change to the future cash flows we expect to derive from our operations. Reductions of cash flows used in the valuation analyses may result in the recording of impairments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.  Refer to Item\u00a07.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations number for further comments on impairments.\nPrice increases for commercial airline services for our guests or major changes or reduction in commercial airline services and/or availability could adversely impact the demand for cruises and undermine our ability to provide reasonably priced vacation packages to our guests.\nMany of our guests depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to or from the ports where our cruises embark or disembark. Increases in the price of airfare would increase the overall price of the cruise vacation to our guests, which may adversely impact demand for our cruises. In addition, changes in the availability and/or regulations governing commercial airline services, including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our guests\u2019 ability to obtain air travel, as well as our ability to transfer our guests to or from our cruise ships, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nTerrorist attacks, war, and other hostilities could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nEvents such as terrorist attacks, war (or war-like conditions), conflicts (domestic or cross-border), civil unrest and other hostilities, including an escalation in the frequency or severity of incidents, and the resulting political instability, travel restrictions and advisories, and concerns over safety and security aspects of traveling or the fear of any of the foregoing have had, and could have in the future, a significant adverse impact on demand and pricing in the travel and vacation industry. In view of our global operations, we are susceptible to a wide range of adverse events. These events could also result in additional security measures taken by local authorities which may potentially impact access to ports and/or destinations.\nDisease outbreaks and an increase in concern about the risk of illness could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nDisease outbreaks and increased concern related to illness when travelling to, from, and on our ships could cause a drop in demand for cruises, guest cancellations, travel restrictions, an unavailability of ports and/or destinations, cruise cancellations, ship redeployments and an inability to source our crew, provisions or supplies from certain places. In addition, we may be subject to increased concerns that cruises are more susceptible than other vacation alternatives to the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19.  In response to disease outbreaks our industry, including our passengers and crew, may be subject to enhanced health and safety requirements in the future which may be costly and take a significant amount of time to implement across our fleet. For example, local governments may establish their own set of rules for self-quarantines and/or require proof of individuals health status or vaccination prior to or upon visiting. The impact of any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, the new operating protocols we are developing and any other health protocol we may develop or that \nmay be required by law in the future in response to infectious diseases may be costly to develop and implement and may be less effective than we expected in reducing the risk of infection and spread of such disease on our cruise ships, all of which will negatively impact our operations and expose us to reputational and legal risks.\nIncidents on ships, at port facilities, land destinations and/or affecting the cruise vacation industry in general, and the associated negative media coverage and publicity, have affected and could continue to affect our reputation and impact our sales and results of operations. \nCruise ships, private destinations, port facilities and shore excursions operated and/or offered by us and third parties may be susceptible to the risk of accidents, illnesses, mechanical failures, environmental incidents and other incidents which could bring into question safety, health, security and vacation satisfaction and negatively impact our sales, operations and reputation. Incidents involving cruise ships, and, in particular the safety, health and security of guests and crew and the media coverage thereof, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, have impacted and could continue to impact demand for our cruises and pricing in the industry. In particular, we cannot predict the impact on our financial performance and the public\u2019s concern regarding the health and safety of travel, especially by cruise ship, and related decreases in demand for travel and cruising. Moreover, our ability to attract and retain guests and crew depends, in part, upon the perception and reputation of our company and our brands and the public\u2019s concerns regarding the health and safety of travel generally, as well as regarding the cruising industry and our ships specifically. Our reputation and our business could also be damaged by continued or additional negative publicity regarding the cruise industry in general, including publicity regarding the spread of contagious disease such as COVID-19, over-tourism in key ports and destinations and the potentially adverse environmental impacts of cruising. The considerable expansion in the use of social and digital media has compounded the potential scope and reach of any negative publicity. In addition, incidents involving cruise ships may result in additional costs to our business, increasing government or other regulatory oversight and, in certain cases, potential litigation.\nSignificant weather, climate events and/or natural disasters could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nNatural disasters (e.g. earthquakes, volcanos, wildfires), weather and/or climate events (including hurricanes and typhoons) could impact our source markets and operations resulting in travel restrictions, guest cancellations, an inability to source our crew or our provisions and supplies from certain places. We are often forced to alter itineraries and occasionally cancel a cruise or a series of cruises or to redeploy our ships due to these types of events, which could have an adverse effect on our sales, operating costs and profitability in the current and future periods. Increases in the frequency, severity or duration of these types of events could exacerbate their impact and disrupt our operations or make certain destinations less desirable or unavailable, impacting our revenues and profitability further. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and on industry performance.\nOur sustainability activities, including environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, could result in reputational risks, increased costs and other risks.\nCustomers, investors, lenders, regulators and other industry stakeholders have placed increasing importance on corporate ESG practices and on the implications and social cost of their investments, which could cause us to incur additional costs and changes to our operations. If our ESG practices or disclosures do not meet investor or industry stakeholders' evolving expectations and standards, our customer, employee and supply chain vendor retention, and our brands and reputation, may be negatively impacted, which could affect our business operations and financial condition. We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report and comply with various ESG practices, which could increase our operating costs and affect our results of operations and financial condition. \nIn addition, from time to time, we communicate certain initiatives regarding climate change, and other ESG matters. We could fail or be perceived to fail to achieve such initiatives, which may negatively affect our reputation. The future adoption of new technology or processes to achieve the initiatives could also result in the impairment of existing assets. \nOur reliance on shipyards, their subcontractors and our suppliers to implement our newbuild and ship upgrade programs and to repair and maintain our ships exposes us to risks which could adversely impact our business. \nWe rely on shipyards, their subcontractors and our suppliers to effectively construct our new ships and to repair, maintain, and upgrade our existing ships on a timely basis and in a cost-effective manner. There are a limited number of shipyards with the capability and capacity to build, repair, maintain and/or upgrade our ships. As such, any disruptions affecting the newbuild or fleet modernization supply chain will adversely impact our business as there are limited substitutes.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to suspensions and/or slowdowns of work at certain shipyards, which impacts our ability to construct new ships when and as planned, our ability to timely and cost-effectively procure new capacity, and our ability to execute scheduled drydocks and/or fleet modernizations. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the shipyards, their subcontractors, and our suppliers have resulted in delays in our previously scheduled ship deliveries. Variations from our plan could have a significant negative impact on our business operations and financial condition. \nBuilding, repairing, maintaining and/or upgrading a ship is sophisticated work that involves significant risks. Material increases in commodity and raw material prices, and other cost pressures impacting the construction of a new ship, such as the cost of labor and financing, could adversely impact the shipyard\u2019s ability to build the ship on a cost-effective basis. We may be impacted if shipyards, their subcontractors, and/or our suppliers encounter financial difficulties, supply chain, technical or design problems when building or repairing a ship. If materialized, these problems could impact the timely delivery or cost of new ships or the ability of shipyards to repair and upgrade our fleet in accordance with our needs or expectations. In addition, delays, mechanical faults and/or unforeseen incidents may result in cancellation of cruises or delays of new ship orders or necessitate unscheduled drydocks. Such events could result in lost revenue, increased operating expenses, or both, and thus adversely affect our results of operations.\nAn increase in capacity worldwide or excess capacity in a particular market could adversely impact our cruise sales and/or pricing.\nAlthough our ships can be redeployed, cruise sales and/or pricing may be impacted by the introduction of new ships into the marketplace, reductions in cruise capacity, overall market growth and deployment decisions of ourselves and our competitors. As of December 31, 2021, a total of 78 new ships with approximately 183,000 berths were on order for delivery through 2027 in the cruise industry, including 12 ships currently scheduled to be delivered to us. The further net growth in capacity from these new ships and future orders, without an increase in the cruise industry\u2019s demand and/or share of the vacation market, could depress cruise prices and impede our ability to achieve yield improvement. Further, cruise prices and yield improvement could face additional pressure due to the pace at which we and other cruise line operators return to service.\nIn addition, to the extent that we or our competitors deploy ships to a particular itinerary/region and the resulting capacity in that region exceeds the demand, it may negatively affect our pricing and profitability. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, including potentially impairing the value of our ships and other assets.\nUnavailability of ports of call may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe believe that port destinations are a major reason why guests choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation. The availability of ports and destinations is affected by a number of factors, including industry demand and competition for key ports and destinations, existing capacity constraints, constraints related to the size of certain ships, security, financial limitations on port development, exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors, geopolitical developments and local governmental regulations. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, port availability could also be subject to immediate change depending on local and/or onboard disease cases or other government restrictions as well as to limited availability during the resumption of operations. Higher fuel costs also may adversely impact the destinations on certain of our itineraries as they become too costly to include.\nIn addition, certain ports and destinations have faced a surge of both cruise and non-cruise tourism which, in certain cases, has fueled anti-tourism sentiments and related countermeasures to limit the volume of tourists allowed in these destinations. In certain destinations, countermeasures to limit the volume of tourists have been contemplated and/or put into effect, including proposed limits on cruise ships and cruise passengers. Potential restrictions in ports and destinations, such as Venice, Barcelona or Key West, could limit the itinerary and destination options we can offer our passengers going forward.\nIncreased demand and competition for key ports of call or destinations, limitations on the availability or feasibility of use of specific ports of call and/or constraints on the availability of shore excursions and other service providers at such ports or destinations could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nWe may lose business to competitors throughout the vacation market.\nWe operate in the vacation market and cruising is one of many alternatives for people choosing a vacation. We therefore risk losing business not only to other cruise lines, but also to other vacation operators, which provide other leisure options, including hotels, resorts, internet-based alternative lodging sites and package holidays and tours.\nWe face significant competition from other cruise lines on the basis of cruise pricing, travel advisor preference and also in terms of the nature of ships, services and destinations that we offer to guests. Our principal competitors within the cruise vacation industry include Carnival Corporation & plc, which owns, among others, Aida Cruises, Carnival Cruise Line, Costa Cruises, Cunard Line, Holland America Line, P&O Cruises, Princess Cruises and Seabourn; Disney Cruise Line; MSC Cruises; and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd, which owns Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises. Our revenues are sensitive to the actions of other cruise lines in many areas including pricing, scheduling, capacity and promotions, which can have a substantial adverse impact not only on our revenues, but also on overall industry revenues. \nIn the event that we do not effectively market or differentiate our cruise brands from our competitors or otherwise compete effectively with other vacation alternatives and new or existing cruise companies, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to appropriately balance our cost management and capital allocation strategies with our goal of satisfying guest expectations, it may adversely impact our business success.\nOur goals are to provide high quality products and deliver high quality services. There can be no assurance that we can successfully balance these goals with our cost management and capital allocation strategies. Our business also requires us to make capital allocation decisions across a broad scope of investment options with varying return profiles and time horizons for value realization. These include significant capital investment decisions such as ordering new ships, upgrading our existing fleet, enhancing our technology and/or data capabilities and expanding our portfolio of land-based assets, based on expected market preferences, competition and projected demand. There can be no assurance that our strategies will be successful, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, our ownership and operation of older tonnage, in particular during the business disruption caused by COVID-19, has resulted in impaired asset values due to expected returns that we will not be able to recover.\nOur attempts to expand our business into new markets and new ventures may not be successful.\nWe opportunistically seek to grow our business through, among other things, expansion into new destinations or source markets and establishment of new ventures complementary to our current offerings. These attempts to expand our business increase the complexity of our business, require significant levels of investment and can strain our management, personnel, operations and systems. In addition, we have been unable to execute our attempts to expand our business as a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, as described elsewhere herein. There can be no assurance that these business expansion efforts will develop as anticipated or that we will succeed, and if we do not, we may be unable to recover our investment, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks associated with our development and operation of key land-based destination projects may adversely impact our business or results of operations.\nWe have invested, either directly or indirectly through joint ventures and partnerships, in a growing portfolio of key land-based projects including port and terminal facilities, private destinations and multi-brand destination projects. These investments can increase our exposure to certain key risks depending on the scope, location, and the ownership and management structure of these projects. These risks include susceptibility to weather events, exposure to local political/regulatory developments and policies, logistical challenges and human resource and labor risks and safety, environmental, and health risks, including challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects locally where we have these projects and relationships.\nOur reliance on travel advisors to sell and market our cruises exposes us to certain risks which could adversely impact our business.\nWe rely on travel advisors to generate bookings for our ships. Accordingly, we must maintain competitive commission rates and incentive structures. If we fail to offer competitive compensation packages or fail to maintain our relationships, these agencies may be incentivized to sell cruises offered by our competitors, which could adversely impact our operating results. Our reliance on third-party sellers is particularly pronounced in certain markets. In addition, the travel advisor community is sensitive to economic conditions that impact discretionary income of consumers. Significant disruptions, such as those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, or contractions in the industry could reduce the number of travel advisors available for us to market and sell our cruises, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the strength of our recovery from suspended operations could be delayed if we are not aligned and partnered with key travel advisors.\nBusiness activities that involve our co-investments with third parties may subject us to additional risks.\nPartnerships, joint ventures and other business structures involving our co-investments with third parties generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create additional risks, including the possibility that other investors in such ventures become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations or could have or develop business interests, policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours. In addition to financial risks, our co-investment activities have also presented managerial and operational risks and expose us to reputational or legal concerns. These or other issues related to our co-investments with third parties could adversely impact our operations or liquidity. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Pullmantur S.A. filed for reorganization under the terms of the Spanish insolvency laws.  The Company may be required to continue to provide funding for these affiliated entities and it is unclear when and to what extent these entities will fully resume operations and our ability to provide such funding will be limited by the level and terms of our outstanding indebtedness. Further, due to the arrangements we have in place with our partners in these ventures, we are limited in our ability to control the strategy of these ventures if and when they resume operations, or their use of capital and other key factors to their results of operation which could adversely affect our investments and impact our results of operations.\nPast or pending business acquisitions or potential acquisitions that we may decide to pursue in the future carry inherent risks which could adversely impact our financial performance and condition.\nThe Company, from time to time, has engaged in acquisitions and may pursue acquisitions in the future, which are subject to, among other factors, the Company\u2019s ability to identify attractive business opportunities and to negotiate favorable terms for such opportunities. Accordingly, the Company cannot make any assurances that potential acquisitions will be completed timely or at all, or that if completed, we would realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions. Acquisitions also carry inherent risks such as, among others: (i) the potential delay or failure of our efforts to successfully integrate business processes and realizing expected synergies; (ii) difficulty in aligning procedures, controls and/or policies; and (iii) future unknown liabilities and costs that may be associated with an acquisition. In addition, acquisitions may adversely impact our liquidity and/or debt levels, and the recognized value of goodwill and other intangible assets can be negatively affected by unforeseen events and/or circumstances, which may result in an impairment charge. Any of the foregoing events could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on supply chain vendors and third-party service providers who are integral to the operations of our businesses. These vendors and service providers are also affected by COVID-19 and may be unable or unwilling to deliver on their commitments or may act in ways that could harm our business. \nWe rely on supply chain vendors to deliver key products to the operations of our businesses around the world. Any event impacting a vendor\u2019s ability to deliver goods of the expected quality at the location and time needed could negatively impact our ability to deliver our cruise experience. Events impacting our supply chain could be caused by factors beyond the control of our suppliers or us, including inclement weather, natural disasters, new laws and regulations, labor actions, increased demand, problems in production or distribution and/or disruptions in third-party logistics or transportation systems, including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Any such interruptions to our supply chain could increase our costs and could limit the availability of products critical to our operations.\nIn order to achieve cost and operational efficiencies, we outsource to third-party vendors certain services that are integral to the operations of our global businesses, such as our onboard concessionaires, certain of our call center operations, guest port services, logistics distribution and operation of a large part of our information technology systems, all of which are also affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We are subject to the risk that certain decisions are subject to the control of our third-party service providers and that these decisions may adversely affect our activities. A failure to adequately monitor a third-party service provider\u2019s compliance with a service level agreement or regulatory or legal requirements could result in significant economic and reputational harm to us. There is also a risk the confidentiality, privacy and/or security of data held by third parties or communicated over third-party networks or platforms could become compromised.\nThe potential unavailability of insurance coverage, an inability to obtain insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or our failure to have coverage in sufficient amounts to cover our incurred losses may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe seek to maintain appropriate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates. We normally obtain insurance based on the cost of an asset rather than replacement value, and we also elect to self-insure, co-insure, or use deductibles in certain circumstances for certain risks such as loss of use of a ship or other business interruption. The limits of insurance coverage we purchase are based on the availability of the coverage, evaluation of our risk profile and cost of coverage. We do not carry business interruption insurance and accordingly we have no insurance coverage for loss of revenues or earnings from our ships or other operations. Accordingly, we are not protected against all risks and cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred which could result in an unexpected decrease in our revenue and results of operations in the event of an incident.\nWe are members of four Protection and Indemnity (\u201cP&I\u201d) clubs, which are part of a worldwide group of 13 P&I clubs, known as the International Group of P&I Clubs (the \u201cIG\u201d). P&I coverage provided by the clubs is on a mutual basis, and we are subject to additional premium calls in the event of a catastrophic loss incurred by any member of the 13 P&I clubs, whereby the reinsurance limits purchased by the IG are exhausted. We are also subject to additional premium calls based on investment and underwriting shortfalls experienced by our own individual insurers. Certain liabilities, costs, and expenses associated with COVID-19 cases identified on or traced to our vessels are eligible for insurance coverage under our participation in these P&I clubs.\nWe cannot be certain that insurance and reinsurance coverage will be available to us and at commercially reasonable rates in the future or at all or, if available, that it will be sufficient to cover potential claims. Additionally, if we or other insureds sustain significant losses, the result may be higher insurance premiums, cancellation of coverage, or the inability to obtain coverage. The COVID-19 pandemic, for example, depending on its duration and the associated insurance claims volumes, may potentially impact the insurance markets we rely on for coverage and could adversely impact both the coverage options available to us in the future as well as the premium costs we are required to pay for those coverages. Such events could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. \nDisruptions in our shoreside or shipboard operations or our information systems may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur principal executive office and principal shoreside operations are located in Florida, and we have shoreside offices throughout the world. Actual or threatened natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes/typhoons, earthquakes, tornadoes, fires or floods), municipal lockdowns, curfews, quarantines, or similar events in these locations may have a material impact on our business continuity, reputation and results of operations. In addition, substantial or repeated information system failures, computer viruses or cyber attacks impacting our shoreside or shipboard operations could adversely impact our business. We do not generally carry business interruption insurance for our shoreside or shipboard operations or our information systems. As such, any losses or damages incurred by us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nProvisions of our Articles of Incorporation, By-Laws and Liberian law could inhibit a change of control and may prevent efforts by our shareholders to change our management.\nCertain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws and Liberian law may inhibit third parties from effectuating a change of control of the Company without approval from our board of directors which could result in the entrenchment of current management. These include provisions in our Articles of Incorporation that prevent third parties, other than A. Wilhelmsen AS and Cruise Associates and their permitted transferees, from acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 4.9% of our outstanding shares without the consent of our board of directors.\nCompliance and Regulatory Risks\nChanges in U.S. or other countries\u2019 foreign travel policy have affected, and may continue to affect our results of operations.\nChanges in U.S. foreign policy have in the past and could in the future result in the imposition of travel restrictions or travel bans on U.S. persons to certain countries or result in the imposition of travel advisories, warnings, rules, regulations or legislation exposing us to penalties or claims of monetary damages.  In addition, some countries have adopted restrictions against U.S. travelers, and we currently cannot predict when those restrictions will be eased. The timing and scope of these changes and regulations can be unpredictable, and they could cause us to cancel scheduled sailings, possibly on short notice, or could result in litigation against us. This, in turn, could decrease our revenue, increase our operating costs and otherwise impair our profitability.\nEnvironmental, labor, health and safety, financial responsibility and other maritime regulations and measures could affect operations and increase operating costs.\nThe U.S. and various state and foreign government or regulatory agencies have enacted or may enact environmental regulations or policies, such as requiring the use of low sulfur fuels (e.g. IMO 2020), that could increase our direct cost to operate in certain markets, increase our cost of fuel, limit the supply of compliant fuel, cause us to incur significant expenses to purchase and/or develop new equipment and adversely impact the cruise vacation industry. While we have taken and expect to continue to take a number of actions to mitigate the potential impact of certain of these regulations, there can be no assurances that these efforts will be successful over the long term.\nThere is increasing global regulatory focus on climate change, greenhouse gas and other emissions. These regulatory efforts, both internationally and in the U.S., are still developing, and we cannot yet determine what the final regulatory programs or their impact will be. However, such climate change-related regulatory activity in the future may adversely affect our business and financial results by requiring us to reduce our emissions, purchase allowances or otherwise pay for our emissions and may increase our exposure, if any, to climate change-related litigation. Such activity may also impact us by increasing our operating costs, including fuel costs.\nIn addition, we are subject to various international, national, state and local laws, regulations and treaties that govern, among other things, discharge from our ships, safety standards applicable to our ships, treatment of disabled persons, health and sanitary standards applicable to our guests, security standards on board our ships and at the ship/port interface areas, and financial responsibilities to our guests. These issues are, and we believe will continue to be, an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world. This could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that could subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future and may increase our exposure, if any, to environmental-related litigation.\nSome environmental groups also have generated negative publicity about the environmental impact of the cruise vacation industry and are advocating for more stringent regulation of ship emissions at berth and at sea. Growing environmental scrutiny of the cruise industry and any related measures could adversely impact our operations and financial results and subject us to reputational impacts and costs.\nA change in our tax status under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, or other jurisdictions, may have adverse effects on our results of operations.\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and a number of our subsidiaries are foreign corporations that derive income from a U.S. trade or business and/or from sources within the U.S. In connection with the year end audit, each year, Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP, our U.S. tax counsel, delivers to us an opinion, based on certain representations and assumptions set forth in it, to the effect that this income, to the extent derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships, is excluded from gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code. We believe that most of our income (including that of our subsidiaries) is derived from or incidental to the international operation of ships.\nOur ability to rely on Section 883 could be challenged or could change in the future. Provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, including Section 883, are subject to legislative change at any time. Moreover, changes could occur in the future with respect to the identity, residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders, trading volume or trading frequency of our shares, or relevant foreign tax laws of Liberia or the Bahamas, such that they no longer qualify as equivalent exemption jurisdictions, that could affect our eligibility for the Section 883 exemption. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be exempt from U.S. income tax on U.S. source shipping income in the future. If we were not entitled to the benefit of Section 883, we and our subsidiaries would be subject to U.S. taxation on a portion of the income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships, which would reduce our net income.\nAdditionally, portions of our business are operated by companies that are within the United Kingdom tonnage tax regime. Further, some of our operations are conducted in jurisdictions where we rely on tax treaties to provide exemption from taxation. To the extent the United Kingdom tonnage tax laws change or we do not continue to meet the applicable qualification requirements or if tax treaties are changed or revoked, we may be required to pay higher income tax in these jurisdictions, adversely impacting our results of operations.\nAs budgetary constraints continue to adversely impact the jurisdictions in which we operate, increases in income tax regulations, tax audits or tax reform affecting our operations may be imposed.\nWe are not a U.S. corporation and, as a result, our shareholders may be subject to the uncertainties of a foreign legal system in protecting their interests.\nOur corporate affairs are governed by our Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws and by the Business Corporation Act of Liberia. The provisions of the Business Corporation Act of Liberia resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the U.S. However, there are very few judicial cases in Liberia interpreting the Business Corporation Act of Liberia. While the Business Corporation Act of Liberia provides that it is to be applied and construed to make the laws of Liberia, with respect of the subject matter of the Business Corporation Act of Liberia, uniform with the laws of the State of Delaware and other states with substantially similar legislative provisions (and adopts their case law to the extent it is non-conflicting), there have been few Liberian court cases interpreting the Business Corporation Act of Liberia, and we cannot predict whether Liberian courts would reach the same conclusions as United States courts. We understand that legislation has been proposed but not yet adopted by the Liberian legislature which amends the provisions regarding the adoption of non-Liberian law to, among other things, provide for the adoption of the statutory and case law of Delaware and not also states with substantially similar legislative provisions, and potentially provide the courts of Liberia discretion in application of non-statutory corporation law of Delaware in cases when the laws of Liberia are silent.  The right of shareholders to bring a derivative action in Liberian courts may be more limited than in U.S. jurisdictions. There may also be practical difficulties for shareholders attempting to bring suit in Liberia, and Liberian courts may or may not recognize and enforce foreign judgments. Thus, our shareholders may have more difficulty challenging actions taken by management, directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a U.S. jurisdiction.\nGeneral Risk Factors \nConducting business globally may result in increased costs and other risks.\nWe operate our business globally, which exposes us to a number of risks, including increased exposure to a wider range of regional and local economic conditions, volatile local political conditions, potential changes in duties and taxes, including changing and/or uncertain interpretations of existing tax laws and regulations, required compliance with additional laws and policies affecting cruising, vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreign-based companies, currency fluctuations, interest rate movements, difficulties in operating under local business environments, port quality and availability in certain regions, U.S. and global anti-bribery laws and regulations, imposition of trade barriers and restrictions on repatriation of earnings.\nOur future growth strategies increasingly depend on the growth and sustained profitability of international markets. Factors that will be critical to our success in these markets include our ability to continue to raise awareness of our products and our ability to adapt our offerings to best suit rapidly evolving consumer demands. This risk is further heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic, as authorities in many of these markets have implemented numerous measures to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19, such as travel bans and restrictions, shelter-in-place/stay-at-home orders, and other limitations on business activity, including business closures. In addition, these measures could change unpredictably and/or could be scaled up or down in response to evolving intensity or resurgence of COVID-19 and related variants in or around these markets. The execution of our planned growth strategies is \ndependent on meeting the governmental and regulatory measures and policies in each of these markets. Our ability to realize our future growth strategy is highly dependent on our ability to satisfy country-specific policies and requirements in order to return to service, as well as meet the needs of region-specific consumer preferences as services come back online. These factors may cause us to reevaluate some of our international business strategies.\nOperating globally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal, regulatory and tax requirements. In many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate, practices in the local business communities might not conform to international business standards. These legal and regulatory requirements and standards may change in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and there may be greater uncertainty as to the interpretation and enforcement of applicable laws and regulations, including those introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot guarantee consistent interpretation, application, and enforcement of rules and regulations put in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which could place limits on our operations or increase our costs, as well as negatively impact our future growth strategies in our key growth markets. We must adhere to policies designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance as well as applicable laws and regulations. However, we might not be successful in ensuring that our employees, agents, representatives and other third parties with whom we associate properly adhere to applicable laws and regulations. In addition, we may be exposed to the risk of penalties and other liabilities if we fail to comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may be subject to frequent and rapid change. Failure by us, our employees or any of these third parties to adhere to our policies or applicable laws or regulations could result in penalties, sanctions, damage to our reputation and related costs, which in turn could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a global operator, our business also may be impacted by changes in U.S. policy or priorities in areas such as trade, immigration (including any continuation of any of the immigration policies put in place by the U.S. government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic) and/or environmental or labor regulations, among others. Depending on the nature and scope of any such changes, they could impact our domestic and international business operations. Any such changes, and any international response to them, could potentially introduce new barriers to passenger or crew travel and/or cross border transactions, impact our guest experience and/or increase our operating costs.\nIf we are unable to address these risks adequately, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected, including impairing the value of our ships and other assets.\nThe terms of our existing debt financing gives, and any future preferred equity or debt financing may give, holders of any preferred securities or debt securities rights that are senior to rights of our common shareholders.\nThe holders of our existing debt have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock in the event of liquidation. If we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of preferred stock or convertible securities, the terms of the debt or the preferred stock issued may give the holders rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation. If we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity, the ownership percentage of our existing shareholders would be diluted.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, fuel prices and interest rates could affect our financial results.\nWe are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, fuel prices and interest rates. Significant changes in any of the foregoing could have a material impact on our financial results, net of the impact of our hedging activities and natural offsets. Our operating results have been and will continue to be impacted, often significantly, by changes in each of these factors. \nA portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates. As a result, an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $7.4 billion of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates. This amount represented approximately 34.3% of our total indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021, a hypothetical 1% increase in prevailing interest rates would increase our forecasted 2022 interest expense by approximately $48.7\u00a0million.\nAdditionally, the value of our earnings in foreign currencies is adversely impacted by a strong U.S. dollar. In addition, any significant increase in fuel prices could materially and adversely affect our business as fuel prices impact not only our fuel costs, but also some of our other expenses, such as crew travel, freight, and commodity prices. Mandatory fuel restrictions may also create uncertainty related to the price and availability of certain fuel types potentially impacting operating costs and the value of our related hedging instruments. \nThe loss of key personnel, our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel, or disruptions among our shipboard personnel could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur success depends, in large part, on the skills and contributions of key executives and other employees and on our ability to recruit, develop and retain high quality personnel as well as having adequate succession plans and back-up operating plans for when critical executives are unable to serve. As demand for qualified personnel in the industry grows, we must continue to effectively recruit, train, motivate and retain our employees, both shoreside and on our ships, in order to effectively compete in our industry, maintain our current business and support our projected global growth.\nWe are experiencing difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel as a result of COVID-19, the reduction in our workforce during our suspension of cruise operations, general macroeconomic conditions and a competitive labor market. Our ability to rehire crew may be negatively impacted by increasing demands related to our health and safety protocols, including vaccine requirements, and by a reduced labor supply as previous crew may have obtained alternative employment during our suspension of cruise operations. A prolonged shortage of qualified personnel and/or increased turnover could decrease our ability to operate our business in an optimal manner. The shortage and competitive labor market may result in increased costs if we need to hire temporary personnel, and/or increased wages and/or benefits in order to attract and retain employees, all of which may negatively impact our results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 86% of our shipboard employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. A dispute under our collective bargaining agreements could result in a work stoppage of those employees covered by the agreements. We may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements when they expire. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage on our ships. We may also be subject to or affected by work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements. Any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, as could a loss of key employees, our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or disruptions among our personnel. \nIf we are unable to keep pace with developments in technology, including technology in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations or competitive position could become impaired.\nOur business continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems. These technologies and systems require significant investment and must be proven, refined, updated, upgraded and/or replaced with more advanced systems in order to continue to meet our customers\u2019 demands and expectations. If we are unable to do so in a timely manner or within reasonable cost parameters or if we are unable to appropriately and timely train our employees to operate any of these new systems, our business could suffer. We also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system, which could result in higher than anticipated costs or impair our operating results.\nIn response to COVID-19, we have relied on technology to assist with mitigating the risk of COVID-19 for our passengers and crew. For example, we have deployed our patented eMuster technology across our fleet in an effort to minimize congregate settings onboard. Additionally, on certain vessels we have deployed our patented contact tracing technology in an effort to quickly identify close contacts of cases onboard.  As this technology continues to develop we may be faced with technical constraints or development decisions. We may be unable to obtain appropriate technology in a timely manner or at all or we may incur significant costs in doing so. A failure to adopt the appropriate technology, or a failure or obsolescence in the technology that we do adopt, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are exposed to cyber security attacks and data breaches and the risks and costs associated with protecting our systems and maintaining data integrity and security.\nWe are subject to cyber security attacks. These cyber attacks can vary in scope and intent from attacks with the objective of compromising our systems, networks, and communications for economic gain or with the objective of disrupting, disabling or otherwise compromising our maritime and/or shoreside operations. The attacks can encompass a wide range of methods and intent, including phishing attacks, illegitimate requests for payment, theft of intellectual property, theft of confidential or non-public information, installation of malware, installation of ransomware and theft of personal or business information.  The frequency and sophistication of, and methods used to conduct, these attacks, have increased over time.\nA successful cyber security attack may target us directly, or it may be the result of a third party\u2019s inadequate care, or resulting from vulnerabilities in licensed software. In either scenario, the Company may suffer damage to its systems and data that could interrupt our operations, adversely impact our brand reputation, and expose us to increased risks of governmental investigation, litigation, fines, and other liability, any of which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, responding to such an attack and mitigating the risk of future attacks could result in additional operating and capital costs in technology, personnel, monitoring and other investments.\nWe are also subject to various risks associated with the collection, handling, storage, and transmission of sensitive information. In the regular course of business, we collect employee, customer, and other third-party data, including personally identifiable information and individual payment data, for various business purposes. Although we have policies and procedures in place to safeguard such sensitive information, this information has been and could be subject to cyber security attacks and the aforementioned \nrisks. In addition, we are subject to federal, state, and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information and individual payment data. Those laws include, among others, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and regulations of the New York State Department of Financial Services and similar state agencies that impose additional cyber security requirements as a result of our provision of certain insurance products. Complying with these and other applicable laws has caused, and may cause, us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices, and our failure to do so may expose us to substantial fines, penalties, restrictions, litigation, or other expenses and adversely affect our business. Further, any changes to laws or regulations, including new restrictions or requirements applicable to our business, or an increase in enforcement of existing laws and regulations, could expose us to additional costs and liability and could limit our use and disclosure of such information.\nWhile we continue to evolve our cyber security practices in line with our business\u2019 reliance on technology and the changing external threat landscape, and we invest time, effort, and financial resources to secure our systems, networks and communications, our security measures cannot provide absolute assurance that we will be successful in preventing or defending from all cyber security attacks impacting our operation. There can be no assurance that any breach or incident will not have a material impact on our operations and financial results. \nAny breach, theft, loss, or fraudulent use of guest, employee, third-party or company data, could adversely impact our reputation and brand and our ability to retain or attract new customers, and expose us to risks of data loss, business disruption, governmental investigation, litigation and other liability, any of which could adversely affect our business. Significant capital investments and other expenditures could be required to remedy the problem and prevent future breaches, including costs associated with additional security technologies, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached. Further, if we or our vendors experience significant data security breaches or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant data security breaches, we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation.\nLitigation, enforcement actions, fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations and/or damage our reputation.\nOur business is subject to various U.S. and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions, fines, civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages. In addition, improper conduct by our employees, agents or joint venture partners could damage our reputation and/or lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines. In certain circumstances it may not be economical to defend against such matters and/or our legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter. Such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, increases in litigation pertaining to the COVID-19 crisis, including potential claims for non-refundable cash deposits. We cannot predict the quantum or outcome of any such proceedings and the impact that they will have on our financial results, but any such impact may be material. While some of these claims are covered by insurance, we cannot be certain that all of them will be, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\n23\nTable of Contents", "item7": ">Item\u00a07.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThe discussion under this caption \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and elsewhere in this document, includes \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(Refer to Note 1\n. General\n and Note 2\n. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n to our consolidated financial statements under Item\u00a08. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n). Certain of our accounting policies are deemed \"critical,\" as they require management's highest degree of judgment, estimates and assumptions. We have discussed these accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. We believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows:\nLiquidity and COVID-19\nThe effects of COVID-19 have had and continue to have a material negative impact on our operations, financial results and liquidity. The full extent of the impact will be determined by the length of time COVID-19 influences our industry and our gradual return to service. Given the ongoing effects of COVID-19 on our operations and global bookings, we have identified the estimation of our future liquidity requirements as a critical accounting policy.\n\u2022\nExpected continued gradual resumption of cruise operations;\n\u2022\nExpected sustained increase in revenue per available passenger cruise day during our continued resumption of cruise operations; \n\u2022\nExpected lower than comparable historical occupancy levels during our continued resumption of cruise operations, increasing over time until we reach historical occupancy levels; and\n\u2022\nExpected spend during our continued resumption of cruise operations, including returning our crew members to our vessels and maintaining enhanced health and safety protocols.\nThe assumptions used to estimate our liquidity requirements are frequently and continuously evaluated because of the unprecedented environment that we are experiencing due to COVID-19. In addition, the magnitude, duration and speed of the global pandemic continues to be uncertain. As a result, we have made reasonable estimates and judgments of the impact of COVID-19 on our liquidity within our financial statements and there may be changes to those estimates in future periods. \nWe have taken and will continue to take actions to improve our liquidity, including:\n\u2022\nReduction of capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nReduction of operating expenses in 2020 and 2021 during the suspension of our global cruise operations (including furloughing staff and laying up vessels);\n\u2022\nAmending credit agreements to defer payments and covenant requirements, as well as extend maturity dates;\n\u2022\nRaising capital through debt and stock issuances; and\n\u2022\nSuspending dividend payments.\nShip Accounting\nShips represent our most significant assets and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of ships is generally computed net of a 10%-15% projected residual value, using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, which is generally 30-35 years. The 30-35 year useful life and 10%-15% residual value is the weighted-average of all major components of a ship. Our useful life and residual value estimates take into consideration the impact of anticipated technological changes, long-term cruise and vacation market conditions and historical useful lives of similarly-built ships. In addition, we take into consideration our estimates of the weighted-average useful lives of the ships' major component systems, such as hull, superstructure, main electric, engines and cabins. We employ a cost allocation methodology at the component level, in order to support the estimated weighted-average useful lives and residual values, as well as to determine the net cost basis of assets being replaced. Given the very large and complex nature of our ships, our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain. We do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ship systems. However, we estimate the costs, useful lives and residual values of component systems based principally on general and technical information known about major ship component systems and their lives, as well as our knowledge of the cruise vacation industry. We do not identify and track depreciation by ship component systems, but instead utilize these estimates to determine the net cost basis of assets replaced or refurbished. Improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as additions to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements' estimated useful lives or that \n29\nTable of Contents\nof the associated ship. The estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of replaced or refurbished ship components are written off and any resulting losses are recognized within \nCruise operating expenses \nin our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss.\nWe periodically review estimated useful lives and residual values for ongoing reasonableness, considering long term views on our intended use of each class of ships and the planned level of improvements to maintain and enhance vessels within those classes. In the event a factor is identified that may trigger a change in the estimated useful lives and residual values of our ships, a review of the estimate is completed. \nWe use the deferral method to account for drydocking costs. Under the deferral method, drydocking costs incurred are deferred and charged to expense on a straight-line basis over the period to the next scheduled drydock, which we estimate to be a period of thirty to sixty months based on the vessel's age as required by Class. Deferred drydock costs consist of the costs to drydock the vessel and other costs incurred in connection with the drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessel's Class certification. Class certification is necessary in order for our cruise ships to be flagged in a specific country, obtain liability insurance and legally operate as passenger cruise ships. The activities associated with those drydocking costs cannot be performed while the vessel is in service and, as such, are done during a drydock as a planned major maintenance activity. The significant deferred drydock costs consist of hauling and wharfage services provided by the drydock facility, hull inspection and related activities (e.g., scraping, pressure cleaning, bottom painting), maintenance to steering propulsion, thruster equipment and ballast tanks, port services such as tugs, pilotage and line handling, and freight associated with these items. We perform a detailed analysis of the various activities performed for each drydock and only defer those costs that are directly related to planned major maintenance activities necessary to maintain Class. The costs deferred are related to activities not otherwise routinely periodically performed to maintain a vessel's designed and intended operating capability. Repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred.\nWe use judgment when estimating the period between drydocks, which can result in adjustments to the estimated amortization of drydock costs. If the vessel is disposed of before the next drydock, the remaining balance in deferred drydock is written-off to the gain or loss on disposal of vessel in the period in which the sale takes place. We also use judgment when identifying costs incurred during a drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessel's Class certification as compared to those costs attributable to repairs and maintenance which are expensed as incurred. \nWe believe we have made reasonable estimates for ship accounting purposes. However, should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimates of ship useful lives or projected residual values, depreciation expense could be materially higher or lower. If circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized, the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense. If we had reduced our estimated average ship useful life by one year, depreciation expense for 2021 would have increased by approximately $48.0 million. If our ships were estimated to have no residual value, depreciation expense for 2021 would have increased by approximately $261.7 million. We have evaluated our estimated ship useful lives and projected residual values in light of our current environment and determined that there are no changes to these estimates based on our gradual return to service.\nBusiness Combinations\nOn July 31, 2018, we acquired a 66.7% equity stake (\"the 2018 acquisition\") in Silversea Cruises, previously known as  Silversea Cruises Holding Ltd., an ultra-luxury and expedition cruise line, from Heritage Cruise Holding Ltd. (\"Heritage\"), previously known as Silversea Cruises Group Ltd. The purchase price for the 2018 acquisition consisted of $1.02 billion in cash, net of assumed liabilities, and contingent consideration due to Heritage. The fair value of the contingent consideration at the time of the 2018 acquisition was $44.0 million. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration were recorded in our results of operations, if any, in the period of the change prior to its termination. \nOn July 9, 2020, we acquired the remaining 33.3% interest in Silversea Cruises that we did not already own (the \"noncontrolling interest\") from Heritage. As a result of the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest, Silversea Cruises is now a wholly owned cruise brand. Refer to Note 1. \nGeneral \nto our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n for further information regarding acquisition of Silversea Cruises' noncontrolling interest. \nWe account for business combinations in accordance with ASC 805,\u00a0\nBusiness Combinations\n, by applying the acquisition method of accounting. The\u00a0acquisition\u00a0method of accounting requires that we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and the noncontrolling interest, if any, at their respective fair values at the\u00a0acquisition\u00a0date. Goodwill is recognized as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Significant estimates and assumptions are made by management to value such assets and liabilities based on third party valuations such as appraisals or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques. Although we believe that those estimates and assumptions are \n30\nTable of Contents\nreasonable and appropriate, they are inherently uncertain and subject to change. If during the measurement period (not to exceed one year), additional information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the\u00a0acquisition\u00a0date related to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we may adjust our estimates to account for subsequent adjustments to the provisional amounts recognized at the\u00a0acquisition\u00a0date, resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill associated with the business acquired. Our purchase price measurement period for the Silversea Cruises 2018 acquisition was closed during 2019. \nUncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. Additionally, any contingent consideration is estimated\u00a0at fair value at the acquisition\u00a0date. Liability-classified contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings until the contingent consideration is settled. \nValuation of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets\nWe review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or, when events or circumstances dictate, more frequently. The impairment review for goodwill consists of a qualitative assessment of whether it is more-likely than-not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, and if necessary, a goodwill impairment test. Factors to consider when performing the qualitative assessment include general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, changes in forecasted operating results, changes in fuel prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nThe goodwill impairment analysis consists of a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value.  We typically estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model, which may also include a combination of a market-based valuation approach. The estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected revenues, operating costs, marketing, selling and administrative expenses, interest rates, ship additions and retirements as well as assumptions regarding the cruise vacation industry's competitive environment and general economic and business conditions, among other factors. The principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model for our 2021 impairment assessments were:\n\u2022\nForecasted net revenues, primarily the timing of returning to normalized operations, occupancy rates from existing and expected ship deliveries, and terminal growth rate; and\n\u2022\nWeighted average cost of capital (i.e., discount rate).\nThe discounted cash flow model uses the most current projected operating results for the upcoming fiscal year as a base.  We discount the projected cash flows using rates specific to the reporting unit based on its weighted-average cost of capital.\nIf the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no write-down of goodwill is required. As amended by ASU No. 2017-04, \nIntangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) \u2013 Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\n, if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its net assets, an impairment is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to such reporting unit.\nThe impairment review for indefinite-life intangible assets can be performed using a qualitative or quantitative impairment assessment. The quantitative assessment consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying value. We estimate the fair value of these assets using a discounted cash flow model and various valuation methods depending on the nature of the intangible asset, such as the relief-from-royalty method, for trademarks and trade names. The principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model for our 2021 impairment assessments were:\n\u2022\nForecasted net revenues, primarily the timing of returning to normalized operations, occupancy rates from existing and expected ship deliveries and terminal growth rate;\n\u2022\nRoyalty rate; and\n\u2022\nWeighted average cost of capital (i.e., discount rate).\nIf the carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. If the fair value exceeds its carrying value, the indefinite-life intangible asset is not considered impaired. Other intangible assets assigned finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Refer to Note 5.\n Intangible Assets\n to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplemental Data \nfor further information on indefinite-life intangible assets.\n31\nTable of Contents\nWe review our ships and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate, based on recent and projected cash flow performance and remaining useful lives, that the carrying value of these assets may not be fully recoverable. We evaluate asset impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The lowest level for which we maintain identifiable cash flows that are independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities is at the ship level for our ships. If estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset, an impairment charge is recognized to the extent its carrying value exceeds fair value. Refer to Note 6\n. Property and Equipment \nto our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplemental Data \nfor further information on determination of fair value for long-lived assets. \nWe estimate fair value based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If active markets are not available, we base fair value on independent appraisals, sales price negotiations and projected future cash flows discounted at a rate estimated by management to be commensurate with the business risk. Quoted market prices are often not available for individual reporting units and for indefinite-life intangible assets. Accordingly, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit and an indefinite-life intangible asset using an expected present value technique.\nAs a result of our voluntary suspension of global cruise operations effective March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 outbreak and our gradual resumption of cruise operations during 2021, we performed interim impairment evaluations, in addition to our annual impairment reviews, of certain of our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets in connection with the preparation of our 2021 and 2020 quarterly and annual financial statements, as further discussed below.\nRoyal Caribbean International Reporting Unit\nWe performed interim impairment evaluations of Royal Caribbean International\u2019s goodwill in connection with the preparation of our quarterly financial statements for the periods ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020 due to the significant impact that COVID-19 had on our projected cash flows and triggering events identified in those quarters.The fair value of the Royal Caribbean International reporting unit as of March 31, 2020 was determined using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model and for June 30, 2020 we used a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model in combination with a market-based valuation approach. As a result of the tests, we determined that the fair value of the Royal Caribbean International reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 30% and 8% as of March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020, respectively, resulting in no impairment to the Royal Caribbean International goodwill in those periods. We did not perform an interim impairment evaluation of Royal Caribbean International's goodwill subsequent to the quarter ended June 30, 2020 during 2020 or 2021, as no triggering events were identified.\nDuring the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2020, we performed our annual impairment review of goodwill for Royal Caribbean International's reporting unit. We did not perform qualitative assessments but instead proceeded directly to the goodwill impairment tests. As of November 30, 2021, the fair value of the Royal Caribbean International reporting unit was determined using a discounted cash flow model in combination with a market-based valuation approach. As November 30, 2020, we used a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model in combination with a market-based valuation approach. As a result of the tests, we determined the fair value of the Royal Caribbean International reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 38% and 14% as of November 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, resulting in no impairment to Royal Caribbean International's goodwill. The carrying value of goodwill attributable to our Royal Caribbean reporting unit was $296.5 million and $296.6 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nSilversea Cruises Reporting Unit\nWe performed interim impairment evaluations of Silversea Cruises\u2019 goodwill and trade name in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. As a result of these analyses, we determined that the carrying value of the Silversea Cruises reporting unit exceeded its fair value. Similarly, we determined that the carrying value of Silversea Cruises\u2019 trade name exceeded its fair value. Accordingly, upon the completion of the impairment tests, we recognized impairment charges of $576.2 million and $30.8\u00a0million for goodwill and the trade name, respectively, during the quarter ended March 31, 2020. We estimated the fair value of the Silversea Cruises reporting unit using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model in combination with a market-based valuation approach. We did not perform an interim impairment evaluation of Silversea Cruises's goodwill or trade names subsequent to the quarter ended March 31, 2020 during 2020 or 2021, as no triggering events were identified. \nDuring the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2020, we performed our annual impairment review of Silversea Cruises goodwill. We did not perform qualitative assessments but instead proceeded directly to the goodwill impairment tests. As of November 30, 2021, the fair value of the Silversea Cruises reporting unit was determined using a discounted cash flow model in combination with a market-based valuation approach. As of November 30, 2020, we used a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model in combination with a market-based valuation approach. As a result of the tests, we determined the fair value \n32\nTable of Contents\nof the Silversea Cruises reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 35% and 12% as of November 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, resulting in no impairment to Silversea Cruises' goodwill. The carrying value of goodwill attributable to our Silversea Cruises reporting unit was $508.6 million as of December\u00a031, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\nDuring the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2020, we performed our annual impairment reviews of Silversea Cruises trade name. As a result of the quantitative tests, we determined that the fair value of the Silversea Cruises' trade name exceeded its carrying value by approximately 19% and 3%, as of November 30, 2021 and November 30, 2020, respectively, resulting in no impairment to Silversea Cruises' tr\nade name. \nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the carrying value of indefinite-life intangible assets was $321.5 million, which primarily relates to the Silversea Cruises trade name.\nLong-lived Assets\nEvents surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the expected undiscounted cash flows of certain of our long-lived assets. We evaluated these assets during the years ended 2021 and 2020 pursuant to our long-lived asset impairment test which resulted in no impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $464.2 million of impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2020 to write down certain ships operated by our Global Brands to their estimated fair values. The amount also includes impairment charges for ships that our Global Brands disposed of during 2020 as well as the three Azamara ships.\nWe also recorded impairment charges of $171.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 for the three ships that we chartered to Pullmantur Holdings prior to the filing of the Pullmantur reorganization. During the quarter ended September 30, 2020, we sold the ships to third parties for amounts approximating their carrying values and no further impairment was recorded. Refer to Note 6.\n Property and Equipment\n and Note 7\n. Other Assets\n to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplemental Data \nfor further information regarding impairment of the ships and Pullmantur's reorganization.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we also determined that certain construction in progress projects would be reduced in scope or would no longer be completed due to the impact COVID-19 has had on our operations. This led to impairment charges of construction in progress assets of $51.6 million and $91.5 million during 2021 and 2020, respectively, as reported in \nProperty and equipment, net. \nIn addition, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we identified that the undiscounted cash flows for certain right-of-use assets were less than their carrying values due to the negative impact of COVID-19. We evaluated these assets pursuant to our long-lived asset impairment test, resulting in an impairment charge of $65.9 million to write down these assets to their estimated fair values during the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, there was no resulting impairment to right-of-use assets.\nThe combined impairment charge of $55.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, related to construction in progress and other long-lived assets, and $1.5\u00a0billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily related to our goodwill, trademarks and trade names, vessels, construction in progress, and right-of-use assets, are reported within \nImpairment and credit losses\n within our consolidate\nd statements of comprehensive (loss) income. These impairment assessments and the resulting charges were determined based on management\u2019s current estimates and projections using information through the time of the issuance of these financial statements. The adverse impact that COVID-19 will continue to have on our business, operating results, cash flows and overall financial condition is uncertain and may result in changes to the assumptions used in the impairment tests discussed above, which\n may result in additional impairments of our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets in the future. Refer to \nRisk Factors\n in Part 1, Item 1A. for further discussion on risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe enter into various forward, swap and option contracts to manage our interest rate exposure and to limit our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. These instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and the vast majority are designated as hedges. We also use non-derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of our net investment in our foreign operations and investments. Although some of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not accounted for under hedge accounting, we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. We account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with authoritative guidance. Refer to Note 2\n. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n and Note 16.\n Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments\n to our consolidated financial statements under Item\u00a08. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary \n33\nTable of Contents\nData \nfor more information on related authoritative guidance, the Company's hedging programs and derivative financial instruments.\nOn a regular basis, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps, fuel swaps and options with third-party institutions in over-the-counter markets. We estimate the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps using expected future cash flows based on the instruments' contract terms and published forward prices for foreign currency exchange and interest rates. We value floors which are embedded within our interest rate swaps using standard option pricing models with inputs based on the options\u2019 contract terms, such as exercise price and maturity, and readily available market data, such as forward interest rates and interest rate volatility. We apply present value techniques to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments.\nWe estimate the fair value of our fuel swaps using expected future cash flows based on the swaps' contract terms and forward prices. We derive forward prices from published forward fuel curves which in turn are based on actual market transactions and published price quotes for similar assets. We apply present value techniques to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments. We also corroborate our fair value estimates using valuations provided by our counterparties.\nWe adjust the valuation of our derivative financial instruments to incorporate credit risk.\nWe believe it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps, fuel swaps and options would be derived from other appropriate valuation models using similar assumptions, inputs or conditions suggested by actual historical experience.\nThe prior suspension of our cruise operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic and our gradual resumption of cruise operations has resulted in reductions to our forecasted fuel purchases. During the year ended December\u00a031, 2021, we discontinued cash flow hedge accounting on 0.2\u00a0million metric tons of our fuel swap agreements maturing in 2021 and 2022, which resulted in the reclassification of a net $0.7\u00a0million loss from \nAccumulated other comprehensive loss \nto\n Other income (expense)\n. During the year ended December\u00a031, 2020, we discontinued cash flow hedge accounting on 0.6\u00a0million metric tons of our fuel swap agreements maturing in 2020 and 2021, which resulted in the reclassification of a net $104.4\u00a0million loss from \nAccumulated other comprehensive loss \nto\n Other income (expense)\n.  Changes in the fair value of fuel swaps for which cash flow hedge accounting was discontinued are currently recognized in\n Other income (expense) \neach reporting period through the maturity dates of the fuel swaps.\nFuture s\nuspension of our operations or modifications to our itineraries may affect our expected forecasted fuel purchases which could result in further discontinuance of fuel swap cash flow hedge accounting and the reclassification of deferred gains or losses from \nAccumulated other comprehensive loss\n into earnings\n. \n Refer to \nRisk Factors\n in Part 1, Item 1A. for further discussion on risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nContingencies\u2014Litigation\nOn an ongoing basis, we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us. While it is typically difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions, we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries, if any, which are recorded as assets when recoverability is probable. We accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries, it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made. \nSeasonality\nOur revenues are seasonal based on demand for cruises. Demand is strongest for cruises during the Northern Hemisphere's summer months and holidays. In order to mitigate the impact of the winter weather in the Northern Hemisphere and to capitalize on the summer season in the Southern Hemisphere, our brands have focused on deployment to the Caribbean, Asia and Australia during that period.\n34\nTable of Contents\nFinancial Presentation\nDescription of Certain Line Items\nRevenues\nOur revenues are comprised of the following:\n\u2022\nPassenger ticket revenues\n, which consist of revenue recognized from the sale of passenger tickets and the sale of air transportation to and from our ships; and\n\u2022\nOnboard and other revenues\n, which consist primarily of revenues from the sale of goods and/or services onboard our ships not included in passenger ticket prices, cancellation fees, sales of vacation protection insurance, pre- and post-cruise tours and fees for operating certain port facilities. \nOnboard and other revenues\n also include revenues we receive from independent third party concessionaires that pay us a percentage of their revenues in exchange for the right to provide selected goods and/or services onboard our ships, as well as revenues received for our bareboat charter, procurement and management related services we perform on behalf of our unconsolidated affiliates.\nCruise Operating Expenses\nOur cruise operating expenses are comprised of the following:\n\u2022\nCommissions, transportation and other expenses\n, which consist of those costs directly associated with passenger ticket revenues, including travel advisor commissions, air and other transportation expenses, port costs that vary with passenger head counts and related credit card fees;\n\u2022\nOnboard and other expenses\n, which consist of the direct costs associated with onboard and other revenues, including the costs of products sold onboard our ships, vacation protection insurance premiums, costs associated with pre- and post-cruise tours and related credit card fees as well as the minimal costs associated with concession revenues, as the costs are mostly incurred by third-party concessionaires and costs incurred for the procurement and management related services we perform on behalf of our unconsolidated affiliates;\n\u2022\nPayroll and related expenses\n, which consist of costs for shipboard personnel (costs associated with our shoreside personnel are included in \nMarketing, selling and administrative expenses\n);\n\u2022\nFood expenses\n, which include food costs for both guests and crew;\n\u2022\nFuel expenses\n, which include fuel and related delivery, storage and emission consumable costs and the financial impact of fuel swap agreements; and\n\u2022\nOther operating expenses\n, which consist primarily of operating costs such as repairs and maintenance, port costs that do not vary with passenger head counts, vessel related insurance, entertainment and gains and/or losses related to the sale of our ships, if any. \nWe do not allocate payroll and related expenses, food expenses, fuel expenses or other operating expenses to the expense categories attributable to passenger ticket revenues or onboard and other revenues since they are incurred to provide the total cruise vacation experience.\nSelected Operational and Financial Metrics\nWe utilize a variety of operational and financial metrics which are defined below to evaluate our performance and financial condition. As discussed in more detail herein, certain of these metrics are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided along with the related GAAP financial measures as we believe they provide useful information to investors as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted (Loss) Earnings per Share (\"Adjusted EPS\") \nrepresents Adjusted Net (Loss) Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (as defined below) divided by weighted average shares outstanding or by diluted weighted average shares outstanding, as applicable. We believe that this non-GAAP measure is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis.\nAdjusted Net (Loss) Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.\n represents net (loss) income less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our \n35\nTable of Contents\nperformance on a comparative basis. For the periods presented, these items included (i) loss on the extinguishment of debt; (ii) the amortization of non-cash debt discount on our convertible notes; (iii) the estimated cash refund expected to be paid to Pullmantur guests and other expenses incurred as part of the Pullmantur S.A. reorganization; (iv) impairment and credit losses recognized as a result of the impact of COVID-19; (v) equity investment asset impairments; (vi) net insurance recoveries related to the collapse of the drydock structure at the Grand Bahama Shipyard involving Oasis of the Seas, or for 2019,  incidental costs, net of insurance recoveries, related to drydock structure incidents Grand Bahama Shipyard; (vii) restructuring charges incurred in relation to the reduction in our U.S. workforce and other initiative expenses, and the reorganization of our international sales and marketing structure in 2019; (viii) the change in the fair value in the Silversea Cruises contingent consideration, the amortization of the Silversea Cruises intangible assets resulting from our acquisition of a 66.7% interest in Silversea Cruises in 2018, and transaction and integration costs related to the 2018 Silversea Cruises acquisition; (ix) the noncontrolling interest adjustment to exclude the impact of the contractual accretion requirements associated with the put option held by Heritage Cruise Holding Ltd. (previously known as Silversea Cruises Group Ltd.) noncontrolling interest in Silversea Cruises, which noncontrolling interest we acquired on July 9, 2020; (x) the net gain recognized in the first quarter of 2021 in relation to the sale of the Azamara brand; (xi) currency translation losses recognized during the second quarter of 2020, in connection with the ships classified as assets held-for-sale that were previously chartered to Pullmantur; and, (xii) the net loss recognized in the fourth quarter of 2021 related to the elimination of the three-month reporting lag for Silversea Cruises.\nAvailable Passenger Cruise Days\n (\"\nAPCD\n\") is our measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period, which excludes canceled cruise days and cabins not available for sale. We use this measure to perform capacity and rate analysis to identify our main non-capacity drivers that cause our cruise revenue and expenses to vary.\nOccupancy (\"Load factor\")\n, in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice, occupancy is calculated by dividing Passenger Cruise Days (as defined below) by APCD. A percentage in excess of 100% indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins.\nPassenger Cruise Days\n represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises.\nAlthough discussed in prior periods, we do not disclose or reconcile in this report our Gross Yields, Net Yields, Gross Cruise Costs, Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel, as defined in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Historically, we have utilized these financial metrics to measure relevant rate comparisons to other periods. However, our 2020 and 2021 reduction in capacity and revenues and the shift in the nature of our running costs, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, do not allow for a meaningful analysis and comparison of these metrics and as such these metrics have been excluded from this report.\nRecent Developments: COVID-19\nReturn to Healthy Sailing\nWe have restarted our global cruise operations in a phased manner, following our voluntary suspension of global cruise operations that commenced in March of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Our return to service efforts incorporate our enhanced health and safety protocols, and the requirements of regulatory agencies, which has resulted in reduced guest occupancy, modified itineraries and vaccination protocols.\nBy the end of December 2021, we operated 50 of our Global and Partner Brand ships, representing over 85% of worldwide capacity, and carried approximately 1.3\u00a0million guests since we resumed operations. \nUncertainties remain as to the specifics, timing and costs of administering and implementing our health and safety measures, some of which may be significant. Based on our assessment of these requirements and recommendations, the status of COVID-19 infection, and its variants, and/or vaccination rates in the U.S. or globally or for other reasons, we may determine it necessary to cancel or modify certain of our Global Brands\u2019 cruise sailings. We believe the impact to our global bookings resulting from COVID-19 will continue to have a material negative impact on our results of operations and liquidity, which may be prolonged beyond containment of the disease and its variants. See Part I. Item 1. \nBusiness - Regulation\n for an update on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (\"CDC\") Framework for Conditional Sailing Order.\nContinued fleet ramp-up\nWe experienced service disruptions and cancelled several sailings in the first quarter of 2022 due to the impact from the Omicron variant (\"Omicron\"). Service disruptions have abated as COVID-19 cases have declined. Despite these service disruptions and cancellations, the overall trajectory of our return to service remains unchanged. We expect that by the end of the first quarter of 2022, 53 out of 62 of our Global and Partner Brand ships, including \nWonder of the Seas,\n which was delivered in \n36\nTable of Contents\nJanuary 2022, will have been brought back to service. Additionally, we expect that the rest of the fleet will return to operations before the summer season.\nWe expect load factors in the first quarter of 2022 to be lower than initially anticipated due to the Omicron impact on bookings and cancellations, particularly on January sailings. As such, we anticipate load factors on core itineraries of approximately 60% during the first quarter of 2022, with sequential monthly improvement, and approximately 7.7 million APCDs for the first quarter of 2022. Core itineraries exclude sailings during the early ramp-up period of up to four weeks and exclude new itineraries implemented during the COVID period.\u202f Additionally, we expect total cash flow from ships in operation in the first quarter to be positive. \nUpdate on Bookings\nWe experienced a softening in booking volumes and an increase in near-term cancellations as a result of the significant short-term disruptions experienced by the travel industry due to Omicron. The disruptions intensified during the holiday season and in early January with the spread of the variant.\n Load factors for sailings in the first half of 2022 are expected to remain below historical levels, consistent with our return to service schedule, which includes the Omicron impact. Load factors for sailings in the second half of 2022 continue to be booked within historical ranges, at higher prices with and without FCCs. We have observed cancellations subside and bookings improve to pre-Omicron levels, and we have adjusted our sales and marketing efforts in anticipation of a delayed and extended WAVE period.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $3.2 billion in customer deposits. Approximately 32% of the customer deposit balance as of December 31, 2021 is related to FCCs compared to 35% of the customer deposit balance as of September 30, 2021, a positive trend indicating new demand.  \nUpdate on Recent Liquidity Actions and Ongoing Uses of Cash\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had liquidity of approximately $3.5\u00a0billion in the form of cash and cash equivalents of $2.7 billion, $0.1\u00a0billion of undrawn revolving credit facility capacity, and a $0.7\u00a0billion\n commitment for a 364-day term loan facility available to draw on at any ti\nme prior to August 12, 2022. Our revolving credit facilities were mostly utilized through a combination of amounts drawn and letters of credit issued under the facilities as of December 31, 2021.  We temporarily applied the net proceeds of the  $1.0\u00a0billion January 2022 Unsecured Notes to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, bringing our undrawn revolving credit facility capacity to $1.1\u00a0billion as of the date of the issuance of this report, from $0.1 billion as of December 31, 2021. We continue to prioritize and bolster liquidity while taking steps to improve our balance sheet and reduce our interest costs to be well positioned for recovery.\nReduced Operating Expenses\nWe took significant actions in early 2020 to reduce operating expenses during the suspension of our global cruise operations. In particular, we: \n\u2022\nsignificantly reduced ship operating expenses, including crew payroll, food, fuel, insurance and port charges;\n\u2022\nfurther reduced operating expenses as the Company\u2019s ships were transitioned into various levels of layup with several ships in the fleet transitioning into cold layup;\n\u2022\nsignificantly reduced marketing and selling expenses; \n\u2022\nreduced and furloughed our workforce, with approximately 23% of our US shoreside employee base being impacted in 2020; and\n\u2022\nsuspended travel for shoreside employees and instituted a hiring freeze across the organization.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDuring our ramp up of operations, we have incurred and will continue to incur incremental spend related to bringing ships back to operating status, returning crew members to ships and implementing enhanced health and safety protocols. We also collected and will continue to collect deposits related to those sailings and for future cruises. We take into account a number of variables in determining when to bring ships back into service, including deployment opportunities, commercial potential, cost of operations and cash flow.\nCapital Expenditures\nCOVID-19 has impacted shipyard operations, which have delayed and may continue to result in delays of our previously contracted ship deliveries. As of December 31, 2021, we anticipate that overall full year capital expenditures, based on our \n37\nTable of Contents\nexisting ships on order, will be approximately $3.1 billion for 2022. This amount does not include any ships on order by our Partner Brands. We took delivery of \nWonder of the Seas\n during the first quarter of 2022 and expect delivery of \nCelebrity Beyond\n during the second quarter of 2022. For 2023, we have three ship deliveries scheduled: \nIcon of the Seas, Celebrity Ascent \nand \nSilver Nova\n.\nDebt Maturities, New Financings and Other Liquidity Actions \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we continued to take actions to further improve our liquidity position and manage cash flow. In particular, we: \n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0extended the maturity date or termination date, as applicable, of certain of the advances and commitments held by consenting lenders under our $1.0\u00a0billion unsecured term loan due April 2022 and our $1.55\u00a0billion unsecured revolving credit facility due October 2022, each by 18 months to October 2023 and April 2024, respectively;\n\u2022\nextended the period during which we may draw upon our binding commitment for a $700.0\u00a0million 364-day term loan facility by one year, which is now available for draw at any time prior to August 12, 2022;\n\u2022\nissued $1.50\u00a0billion of 5.5% senior unsecured notes due in 2028 for net proceeds of approximately $1.48\u00a0billion, which were used to repay principal payments on debt maturing or required to be paid in 2021 and 2022, with the remaining for general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nissued $650.0\u00a0million of 4.25% senior unsecured notes due in 2026 for net proceeds of approximately $640.6\u00a0million, which were used to fully repay the Silversea Notes, in the amount of $619.8\u00a0million, and to pay the related call premiums, accrued interest and fees;\n\u2022\nissued $1.0\u00a0billion of 5.50% senior notes due in 2026 for net proceeds of approximately $986.0\u00a0million, which were used to replenish our capital as a result of the redemption of a portion of the 11.50% senior secured notes due 2025 in the amount of $928.0\u00a0million, and to pay the related premiums and accrued interest;\n\u2022\namended the credit agreements for the unsecured financings of our first and second Evolution-class ships, increasing their maximum loan amounts by \u20ac175.6\u00a0million in the aggregate (or approximately $199.7\u00a0million based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2021), to finance ship design modifications that incorporate innovative sustainability features and additional premium cabins;\n\u2022\nissued 16.9\u00a0million shares of common stock for approximately $1.5\u00a0billion;\n\u2022\namended $4.9\u00a0billion of our non-export-credit facilities and certain of our credit card processing agreements to extend the waiver of the financial covenants through and including the third quarter of 2022 and to implement modified covenants for the period starting fourth quarter of 2022 and extending through and including the fourth quarter of 2023;\n\u2022\namended $6.3\u00a0billion of our export-credit facilities to extend the waiver of the financial covenants through and including the fourth quarter of 2022 and defer $1.15\u00a0billion of principal payments due between April 2021 and April 2022; and \n\u2022\namended $7.3\u00a0billion\u202fof outstanding export-credit financing plus committed export-credit facilities to modify financial covenant levels for 2023 and 2024, following the waiver period through and including the fourth quarter of 2022. \nRefer to Note 8\n. Debt, \nNote 10\n. Shareholders' Equity, \nand\n \nNote 17.\n Commitments and Contingencies\n, to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplemental Data \nfor further information on these financing transactions and our debt covenants.\nExpected debt maturities for 2022 are $2.2 billion. We continue to identify and evaluate further actions to enhance our liquidity and support our recovery. These include and are not limited to further reductions in capital expenditures, operating expenses and administrative costs and additional financings and refinancings. \n38\nTable of Contents\nExecutive Overview\nWhile 2021 proved to be another challenging year for our company and industry, it also marked our successful return to service. Starting in June, we began our return to cruising with 50 ships back in service by year end, representing more than 85% of our capacity. We delivered safe and memorable experiences to approximately 1.3 million guests at record guest satisfaction scores.\nThe out-of-service period in the first half of the year, the costs of returning our ships and crew to operations, the revamping of sales and marketing and the costs to execute on health protocols all had a significant impact on our financial results. Although we generated a fraction of normal revenue levels in 2021, total revenue per passenger cruise day in the fourth quarter was up 10% compared to record 2019 levels. The increase was driven by strong onboard revenue performance seen across every revenue stream. \nSince resuming operations, our focus has been on the safety and well-being of our guests and crew. As Delta and Omicron variants started to spread, they created short-term operational challenges as well as an increase in cancellations. However, our  health and safety protocols, including our crew and guest vaccination requirements, proved to be successful as only 0.19% of our guests tested positive for COVID-19. As infection rates decline and localities lift COVID-19 protocols, we will continue to work closely with  health authorities to maintain protocols that promote the health and safety of our guests, crew, and communities we visit. As part of this commitment, we have opted-in to the  CDC\u2019s new voluntary program in the \u201cHighly Vaccinated Ship\u201d category for health and safety protocols.\nDuring 2021, we remained focused on managing costs, improving our balance sheet and preserving liquidity. We ended the year with approximately $3.5\u00a0billion in liquidity, which includes cash and cash equivalents, undrawn revolving credit facility capacity, and a $0.7\u00a0billion commitment for a loan facility. We re-established access to unsecured debt markets and successfully refinanced $2.3 billion of secured or guaranteed high coupon debt, in some instances reducing the coupon by up to 600 basis points. Given the current environment and anticipated inflationary pressures, we continue to take numerous actions to reshape our cost structure, with a goal of further improving upon our leading pre-COVID margins. \nNew hardware is a key pillar to supporting our recovery and a driver of quality demand and financial performance. This past year we successfully took delivery of\n Celebrity Apex, Odyssey of the Seas \nand \nSilver Dawn\n, all poised to significantly contribute to our yield growth, profitability, and cash generation. Additionally, we look forward to welcoming two new ships in 2022, \nWonder of the Seas\n and\n Celebrity Beyond\n. We expect to return the full fleet before the summer season of 2022 and load factors to reach pre-COVID levels in the third quarter. Although Omicron has caused service disruptions, several cancelled sailings and a likely delay in our return to profitability by a few months, we currently expect to be generating net income in the second half of 2022.\nAs we focus on setting the foundation for a strong recovery and long-term profitable growth, we remain driven to innovate our product and maintain a strong competitive advantage. We finished the year stronger than we started and continue to manage the challenges related to Omicron, as well as search for further operational opportunities on our journey back to financial health. \n39\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nIn addition to the items discussed above under \"Executive Overview,\" significant items for 2021 include:\n\u2022\nOur Net Loss attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Adjusted Net Loss attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021 was $(5.3) billion and $(4.8) billion, or $(20.89) and $(19.19) per share on a diluted basis, respectively, as compared to Net Loss attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Adjusted Net Loss attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. of $(5.8) billion and $(3.9) billion, or $(27.05) and $(18.31) per share on a diluted basis, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\u2022\nTotal revenues, excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency rates, decreased by $686.1 million for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 resulting from a 52.6% decrease in occupancy in 2021 while we gradually returned to service compared to 2020 when the majority of our fleet was operational up through our global suspension in March of 2020.\n\u2022\nThe effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our passenger ticket and onboard and other revenue transactions, denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, resulted in an increase in total revenues of $9.5 million for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020.\n\u2022\nTotal cruise operating expenses, excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency rate, decreased by $114.9 million for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, which reflects the decrease in occupancy mentioned above. \n\u2022\nThe effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our cruise operating expenses, denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, resulted in an increase in total operating expenses of $7.3 million  for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020.\n\u2022\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, as a result of ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and cash flows, we recorded total impairment and credit losses of $82.0 million and $1.6\u00a0billion, respectively, related to long-lived assets and credit losses related to our notes receivable, net of recoveries, in 2021, and to goodwill, trademarks and trade names, long-lived assets, including right-of-use assets, and credit losses related to our notes receivable in 2020. \n\u2022\nEffective October 1, 2021, we eliminated the Silversea Cruises three-month reporting lag to be consistent with the fiscal calendar of the Company. The effect of this change was an increase to net loss of $62.6 million, or a $0.25 per share loss on a basic and diluted basis, and this amount is reported within \nOther (expense) income\n in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2021.

The year ended December 31, 2021 does not include July, August, and September 2021 statistics as Silversea Cruises' results of operations for those months are included within \nOther (expense) income\n in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2021. Refer to Note 1. General to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on the three-month reporting lag.\n(2)         Due to the three-month reporting lag effective through September 30, 2021, we include Silversea Cruises' metrics from October 1, 2019 through September 30, 2020 in the year ended December 31, 2020 and from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019 in the year ended December 31, 2019. \n43\nTable of Contents\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the year ended December, 31, 2021, we include Azamara Cruises' metrics through March 19, 2021, the effective sale date of the brand.  Refer to Note 1. General to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on the sale of the Azamara Cruises brand.\nOutlook \nThe Company\u2019s operations are still impacted by COVID-19 and its related variants. The adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our revenues, consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition has been and will continue to be material in 2022. We expect to incur a net loss on both a U.S. GAAP and adjusted basis for the first quarter and the first half of 2022 and a return to profitability in the second half of 2022. See \nRecent Developments: COVID-19 \u2013 Continued Fleet Ramp-Up\n and \nUpdate on Bookings\n for further indications on our resumption of operations and  the booking environment.\nYear Ended December\u00a031, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December\u00a031, 2020 \nIn this section, references to 2021 refer to the year ended December\u00a031, 2021 and references to 2020 refer to the year ended December\u00a031, 2020.\nRevenues\nTotal revenues\n for 2021 decreased $0.7 billion, or 30.6%, to $1.5 billion from $2.2 billion in 2020.\nPassenger ticket revenues\n comprised 61.4% of our 2021 total revenues. \nPassenger ticket revenues \ndecreased\n \nby $0.6 billion, or 37.4% from 2020. The decrease in Passenger ticket reflects a 52.6% decrease in occupancy for the period in 2021 during which we gradually returned to service compared to occupancy during 2020 when we operated the majority of our fleet, up through our global suspension in March of 2020.\nThe decrease to \nPassenger ticket revenues \nwas slightly offset by the $5.0 million favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our revenues in currencies other than the United States dollar.\nThe remaining 38.6% of 2021 total revenues was comprised of \nOnboard and other revenues\n, which decreased $0.1 billion, or 16.1%. This decrease was primarily due to the  52.6% decrease in occupancy noted above and a decrease in cancellation fees in 2021. These decreases more than offset a strong onboard revenue per passenger cruise day performance during our gradual resumption of operations in 2021 as well as the favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our \nOnboard and other revenues\n denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar of $4.5 million.\nOnboard and other revenues\n included concession revenues of $72.0 million in 2021 and $76.0 million in 2020.\nCruise Operating Expenses \nTotal \nC\nr\nuise operating expenses\n for 2021 decreased $0.1 billion, or 3.9%, to $2.7 billion in 2021 from $2.8 billion in 2020.\u00a0The decrease was primarily due to a $137.1 million decrease in \nCommissions, transportation and other\n expenses and a $40.3 million decrease in \nOnboard and other\n expenses due to the decrease in revenues and occupancy noted above. \nThe decrease in \nCruise operating expenses\n was partially offset by an increase on \nPayroll and related \nexpenses of $49.8\u00a0million due to our return to service during 2021, and the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our expense transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar of $7.3 million.\nMarketing, Selling and Administrative Expenses\nMarketing, selling and administrative expenses\n for 2021 increased $170.5 million, or 14.2% to $1.4 billion from $1.2 billion in 2020. The increase is due to the ramp up of our global sales and marketing efforts in the second half of 2021 as we commenced our resumption of operations.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expenses\n for 2021 increased $13.6 million, or 1.1%, to $1.3 billion. The increase was primarily due to the addition of\n Odyssey of the Seas \nto our fleet in the first quarter of 2021, a full year of depreciation in 2021 for \nCelebrity Apex, Silver Moon\n and \nSilver Origin\n which were added to our fleet during 2020, and to a lesser extent, the addition of \nSilver Dawn\n to our fleet in the fourth quarter of 2021. The increases in depreciation in 2021 were partially offset by lower depreciation resulting from vessel disposals and asset impairments during 2020 and 2021.\nImpairment and Credit Losses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, as a result of the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and cash flows, we recorded total impairment and credit losses of $82.0 million and $1.6\u00a0billion, respectively, \n44\nTable of Contents\nprimarily related to construction in progress, other long-lived assets and credit loss allowances related to our notes receivable in 2021, and to our goodwill, trademarks and trade names, vessels, construction in progress, right-of-use assets and credit loss allowances related to our notes receivable in 2020. \nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest expense, net of interest capitalized\n, increased $447.5 million, or 53.0%, to $1.3 billion in 2021 from $844.2 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to new debt issuances in 2021 and 2020, a higher average balance on our revolver debt and a loss on extinguishment of debt of $138.8 million.\nEquity investment (loss)\n improved by $77.8 million, or 36.5%, to a loss of $135.5 million in 2021 from a loss of $213.3 million in 2020 mainly due to decreased losses reported by our equity investments as a result of their return to operations during 2021 and receipt of local government grants by one of our equity investments.\nOther income \nwas $20.3 million in 2021 compared to \nOther expense\n of $137.1 million in 2020. The improvement of $157.4 million includes an increase in income of $110.6 million related to the change in the fair value of fuel swap derivative instruments that are not designated under hedge accounting, a one-time $14.4 million tax benefit recognized in 2021, and a $13.8 million decrease in foreign exchange losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency compared to 2020. Additionally in 2020, we recognized a deferred currency translation adjustment loss of $69.0\u00a0million related to the Pullmantur brand as we no longer have significant involvement in Pullmantur's operations, which did not recur in 2021, and a $20.0 million expense representing the cash refund expected to be paid to Pullmantur guests as part of the brand's reorganization, compared to a $5.0 million expense in 2021. The 2021 increases in income were partially offset by a $62.6 million loss recognized in 2021 resulting from the elimination of the Silversea Cruises three-month reporting lag effective October 1, 2021. \nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nOther comprehensive income\n in 2021 was $28.5 million compared to $58.4 million in 2020. The decrease of $29.9 million in 2021 was primarily due to a decrease in \nGain on cash flow derivative hedges\n in 2021 of $34.0 million. \nGain on cash flow derivative hedges \ndecreased in 2021 primarily due to the reclassification of fuel swap gains from \nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\n into the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive (Loss) Income in 2021, compared to the reclassification of fuel swap losses during 2020. This decrease was partially offset by a net increase in the fair value of our cash flow derivative hedges, mostly driven by increases in the fair value of our fuel and interest rate swaps in 2021.\nYear Ended December\u00a031, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December\u00a031, 2019\nA discussion of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 is included in Part II. Item 7 of our \nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020\n,\n filed with the SEC on February 26, 2021\n, and is incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.\n45\nTable of Contents\nFuture Application of Accounting Standards\nRefer to Note. 2 \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n to our consolidated financial statements under Item\u00a08. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n for further information on \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Cash\n \nNet cash (used in) operating activities \ndecreased by $1.9 billion to cash used of $1.9 billion for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021, compared to cash used of $3.7 billion for the same period in 2020. Our gradual resumption of operations in 2021 generated increased guest ticket collections, resulting in an increase of customer deposits of $1.4 billion for the twelve months ended December\u00a031, 2021, compared to a decrease of customer deposits of $1.6 billion during the same period in 2020, during our suspension of global operations. The increase in customer deposits was offset by increased expenses for our vessels that resumed cruise operations in 2021, including start up costs. \nNet cash (used in) operating activities was \n$3.7 billion\n \nin 2020 compared to \nNet cash provided\n of  $3.7 billion in 2019\n \nreflecting a change of  $7.4 billion in 2020. The 2020 disruptions to our business led to a decrease in collections from our guests as well as an increase of refunds to guests for cancelled sailings during the year ended December\u00a031, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.\nNet cash used in investing activities \ndecreased $33.8 million to cash used of $2.1 billion for the year ended December\u00a031, 2021, compared to cash used of  $2.2 billion for the same period in 2020. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to an increase in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment and other assets of $148.2 million in 2021 compared to 2020, and a decrease in cash paid on settlement of derivative financial instruments of $87.1 million, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures of $264.6 million mostly due to our purchase of Terminal A at PortMiami in 2021\n.\nNet cash used in investing activities \ndecreased $0.9 billion to cash used $2.2 billion in 2020 compared to cash used $3.1 billion in 2019. The decrease in investing activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in capital expenditures of $1.1 billion.\nNet cash provided by financing activities \nwas $3.0 billion in 2021 compared to cash provided of $9.3 billion in 2020. The decrease of $6.3 billion was primarily attributable to higher debt proceeds and issuance of commercial paper notes of $15.8 billion during the twelve months ended December\u00a031, 2020, compared to the same period in 2021, offset by higher debt and commercial paper repayments of $9.0 billion during the twelve months ended December\u00a031, 2020, compared to the same period in 2021. Additionally, dividends paid of $326.4 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, compared to none during the same period in 2021. \nNet cash provided by financing activities\n was $9.3 billion in 2020 compared to \nNet cash used\n of $0.7 billion in 2019. The change was primarily attributable to an increase in debt proceeds of $10.0 billion in 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, and $1.4 billion in proceeds from common stock issuances in 2020. These proceeds were partially offset by net repayments of commercial paper of $1.1 billion during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to net borrowings of commercial paper of $0.6 billion during the same period in 2019. \nFuture Capital Commitments\nCapital Expenditures\nOur future capital commitments consist primarily of new ship orders. As of December\u00a031, 2021, we have two Oasis-class ships,  and three ships of a new generation, known as our Icon-class, on order for our Royal Caribbean International brand with an aggregate capacity of approximately 28,200 berths. As of December\u00a031, 2021, we have two Edge-class ships on order for our Celebrity Cruises  brand, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 6,500 berths. Additionally, as of December\u00a031, 2021, we have two ships on order for our Silversea Cruises brand with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1,460 berths. Refer to Item 1. \nBusiness-Operations\n for further information on our ships on order. We have committed financing arrangements in place covering 80% of the cost of the ship for the nine ships on order for our Global Brands, almost all of which include sovereign financing guarantees. Additionally, we have an agreement in place with Chantiers de l\u2019Atlantique to build an additional Edge-class ship for delivery in 2025, which is contingent upon completion of conditions precedent and financing.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, the aggregate cost of our ships on order, not including any ships on order by our Partner Brands, was approximately $12.4 billion, of which we had deposited $800.2 million as of such date. Approximately 59.0% of the aggregate cost was exposed to fluctuations in the Euro exchange rate at December\u00a031, 2021. Refer to Note 16.\n Fair Value \n46\nTable of Contents\nMeasurements and Derivative Instruments \nand Note 17.\n Commitments and Contingencies\n to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n.\nDecreased demand for cruising as a result of concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic had, and is expected to continue to have, a material impact on our cash flows, liquidity and financial position. In order to preserve liquidity throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we deferred a significant portion of our planned 2020, 2021 and 2022 capital expenditures. As of December\u00a031, 2021, we anticipate overall full year capital expenditures, based on our existing ships on order, will be approximately $3.1 billion for 2022. These amounts do not include any ships on order by our Partner Brands.\nMaterial Cash Requirements \nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, our material cash requirements were as follows (in thousands): \n\u00a0\nPayments\u00a0due\u00a0by\u00a0period\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLess\u00a0than\n1-3\n3-5\nMore\u00a0than\n\u00a0\nTotal\n1\u00a0year\nyears\nyears\n5\u00a0years\nOperating Activities:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOperating lease obligations\n(1)\n$\n1,272,527\u00a0\n$\n101,445\u00a0\n$\n190,048\u00a0\n$\n154,809\u00a0\n$\n826,225\u00a0\nInterest on long-term debt\n(2)\n3,554,212\u00a0\n938,258\u00a0\n1,286,576\u00a0\n688,131\u00a0\n641,247\u00a0\nOther\n(3)\n534,484\u00a0\n154,552\u00a0\n162,401\u00a0\n63,498\u00a0\n154,033\u00a0\nInvesting Activities:\nShip purchase obligations\n(4)\n9,955,868\u00a0\n2,306,087\u00a0\n4,920,554\u00a0\n2,729,227\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\nFinancing Activities:\nDebt obligations\n(5)\n20,618,065\u00a0\n2,191,620\u00a0\n9,345,412\u00a0\n4,781,668\u00a0\n4,299,365\u00a0\nFinance lease obligations\n(6)\n472,275\u00a0\n51,511\u00a0\n57,497\u00a0\n44,896\u00a0\n318,371\u00a0\nOther\n(7)\n17,374\u00a0\n8,414\u00a0\n8,960\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\nTotal\n$\n36,424,805\u00a0\n$\n5,751,887\u00a0\n$\n15,971,448\u00a0\n$\n8,462,229\u00a0\n$\n6,239,241\u00a0\n___________________________________________________________________\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are obligated under noncancelable operating leases primarily for preferred berthing arrangements, real estate and shipboard equipment.

Interest on variable-rate debt is calculated based on forecasted debt balances, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements, using the applicable rate at December\u00a031, 2021.\u00a0Debt denominated in other currencies is calculated based on the applicable exchange rate at December\u00a031, 2021.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amounts primarily represent future commitments with remaining terms in excess of one year to pay for our usage of certain port facilities, marine consumables, services and maintenance contracts. \n(4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amounts are based on contractual installment and delivery dates for our ships on order.

COVID-19 has impacted shipyard operations which have and may result in delays for our previously contracted ship deliveries. Amounts do not include potential obligations which remain subject to cancellation at our sole discretion or any agreements entered for ships on order that remain contingent upon completion of conditions precedent.  \n(5)   Debt denominated in other currencies is calculated based on the applicable exchange rate at December\u00a031, 2021. In addition, debt  obligations presented above are net of debt issuance costs of\u00a0$363.5 million as of December 31, 2021.\n(6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amounts represent finance lease obligations with initial terms in excess of one year.\n(7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Amounts represent fees payable to sovereign guarantors in connection with certain of our export credit debt facilities and facility fees on our revolving credit facilities.\nPlease refer to \nFunding Needs and Sources\n below for discussion on the planned funding of the above material contractual obligations. \nAs a normal part of our business, depending on market conditions, pricing and our overall growth strategy, we continuously consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships. We may also consider the sale of ships or the purchase of existing ships. We continuously consider potential acquisitions and strategic alliances. If any of these \n47\nTable of Contents\nwere to occur, they would be financed through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the issuance of additional shares of equity securities or through cash flows from operations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nTUI Cruises has entered into various ship construction and credit agreements that include certain restrictions on each of our and TUI AG's ability to reduce our current ownership interest in TUI Cruises below 37.55% through May 2033.\nSome of the contracts that we enter into include indemnification provisions that obligate us to make payments to the counterparty if certain events occur. These contingencies generally relate to changes in taxes, increased lender capital costs and other similar costs. The indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and are entered into in the normal course of business. There are no stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and we are not able to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments, if any, under these indemnification clauses. We have not been required to make any payments under such indemnification clauses in the past and, under current circumstances, we do not believe an indemnification obligation is probable.\nIn June of 2021, we exercised our option under our operating lease with SMBC Leasing and Finance, Inc (the \"Lessor\") to purchase Terminal A at PortMiami in July 2021 for the pre-agreed purchase price of $220.0\u00a0million. Upon purchase of the terminal lease in July 2021, the underlying asset was recorded as a leasehold improvement within \nProperty and equipment, net. \n Our July 2021 purchase of the Port of Miami terminal eliminated the residual value guarantee and a requirement under the lease to post $181.1\u00a0million of cash collateral on or before July 18, 2021.\nCertain of our surety agreements with third party providers for the benefit of certain agencies and associations that provide travel related bonds, allow the sureties to request collateral. We also have agreements with our credit card processors relating to customer deposits received by us for future voyages. These agreements allow the credit card processors to require us, under certain circumstances, including breach of the financial covenants, the existence of other material adverse changes, excessive chargebacks, and other triggering events, to maintain a reserve that can be satisfied by posting collateral.  As of December 31, 2021, we have posted letters of credit as collateral with our sureties and credit card processors under our revolving credit facilities in the amount of $193.3\u00a0million.\nExecuted amendments are in place for the majority of our credit card processors, waiving reserve requirements tied to breach of our financial covenants through at least September 30, 2022, with modified covenants thereafter, and as such, we  do not anticipate any incremental collateral requirements for the processors covered by these waivers in the next 12 months. We have a reserve with a processor where the agreement was amended in the first quarter of 2021, such that proceeds are held in reserve until the sailing takes place or the funds are refunded to the customer. The maximum projected exposure with the processor, including amounts currently withheld and reported in \nTrade and other receivables\n, is approximately $285.0\u00a0million. The amount and timing are dependent on future factors that are uncertain, such as the pace of resumption of our cruise operations, the volume of future deposits and whether we transfer our business to other processors. If we require additional waivers on the credit card processing agreements and are not able to obtain them, this could lead to the termination of these agreements or the trigger of reserve requirements.\nAs of December 31, 2021, other than the items described above, we are not party to any other off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interest, certain derivative instruments and variable interest entities, that either have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial position.\nFunding Needs and Sources\nHistorically, we relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations, draw-downs under our available credit facilities, the incurrence of additional debt and/or the refinancing of our existing debt and the issuance of additional shares of equity securities to fund our obligations. The impact of COVID-19 resulted in our voluntary suspension of global cruise operations from March 2020 up to our gradual resumption of operations primarily in 2021. The suspension of operations strained our sources of cash flow and liquidity, causing us to take actions resulting in reductions in our operating expenses, reductions in our capital expenses and new financings and other liquidity actions.\nThe Company continues to identify and evaluate further actions to improve its liquidity. These include, and are not limited to further reductions in capital expenditures, operating expenses and administrative costs and additional financings. See further discussion on these liquidity actions at \nRecent Developments - COVID-19.\n48\nTable of Contents\nWe have significant contractual obligations of which our debt service obligations and the capital expenditures associated with our ship purchases represent our largest funding needs.\u00a0As of December\u00a031, 2021, we had approximately $10.0 billion of committed financing for our ships on order.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, we had $5.8 billion in contractual obligations due through December 31, 2022, of which approximately $2.2 billion relates to debt maturities, $0.9 billion relates to interest on debt and $2.3 billion relates to progress payments on our ship orders and the final installments payable due upon the delivery of \nWonder of the Seas\n and \nCelebrity Beyond\n. \nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, we had liquidity of $3.5\u00a0billion, including $0.1 billion of undrawn revolving credit facility capacity, $2.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and a \n$0.7\u00a0billion commitment for a 364-day term loan facility \navailable to draw at any time prior to August 12, 2022. As of December\u00a031, 2021, our revolving credit facilities were mostly utilized through a combination of amounts drawn and letters of credit issued under the facilities. We temporarily applied the net proceeds of the $1.0\u00a0billion January 2022 Unsecured Notes to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, bringing our undrawn revolving credit facility capacity to $1.1\u00a0billion as of the date of the issuance of this report, from $0.1 billion as of December 31, 2021.\nWe have agreed with certain of our lenders not to pay dividends or engage in stock repurchases. Thereafter, in the event we declare a dividend or engage in stock repurchases we will need to repay the amounts deferred under our export credit facilities. Refer to Note 10\n. Shareholders' Equity\n to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nIf any person acquires ownership of more than 50% of our common stock or, subject to certain exceptions, during any 24-month period, a majority of our board of directors is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of our board of directors on the first day of such period, we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities, which we may be unable to replace on similar terms.\u00a0Our public debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by a third-party acquisition of greater than 50% of our common stock coupled with a ratings downgrade. If this were to occur, it would have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations.\nBased on our assumptions and estimates and our financial condition, we believe that the liquidity resulting from the actions mentioned above will be sufficient to fund our liquidity requirements over at least the next twelve months. However, there is no assurance that our assumptions and estimates are accurate due to possible unknown variables related to this unprecedented suspension of our operations and, as such, there is inherent uncertainty in our ability to predict future liquidity requirements. Refer to Note 1\n. General, Management\u2019s Plan and Liquidity, \nto our consolidated financial statements under Item 1. \nFinancial Statements\n for further information.\nBeyond the next 12 months, in June  of 2023, approximately $3.2\u00a0billion of long-term debt will need to be refinanced in order to maintain the Company's liquidity position. \nIn February 2022, we entered into certain agreements with Morgan Stanley & Co., LLC (\u201cMS\u201d) where MS agrees to provide backstop committed financing to refinance, repurchase and/or repay in whole or in part our existing and outstanding 10.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2023, 9.125% Priority Guaranteed Notes due 2023, and 4.25% Convertible Notes due 2023. Pursuant to the agreements, we may, at our sole option, issue and sell to MS (subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions) five-year senior unsecured notes with gross proceeds of up to $3.15\u00a0billion at any time between April 1, 2023 and June 29, 2023, to refinance the aforementioned notes. \nDebt Covenants\nBoth our export credit facilities and our non-export credit facilities contain covenants that require us, among other things, to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.25x and limit our net debt-to-capital ratio to no more than 62.5%, and under certain facilities, to maintain a minimum level of shareholders' equity.\u00a0 The fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated by dividing net cash from operations for the past four quarters by the sum of dividend payments plus scheduled principal debt payments in excess of any new financings for the past four quarters.\u00a0Our minimum net worth and maximum net debt-to-capital calculations exclude the impact of \nAccumulated other comprehensive loss \non \nTotal shareholders\u2019 equity\n.\nDuring 2020, we amended all of our export credit facilities, all of our non-export credit facilities and certain of our credit card processing agreements which contain financial covenants to extend the financial covenant waiver through and including the fourth quarter of 2021. During the first quarter of 2021, we amended $4.9\u00a0billion of our non-export credit facilities and $6.3\u00a0billion of our export credit facilities, and certain credit card processing agreements, to extend the waiver of our financial covenants through and including at least the third quarter of 2022, and subsequently in the third quarter of 2021, we entered into a letter agreement to extend the waiver period for our export credit facilities to the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we amended $7.3\u00a0billion of outstanding export-credit facilites plus committed export-credit facilities to \n49\nTable of Contents\nmodify financial covenant levels for 2023 and 2024, following the waiver period through and including the fourth quarter of 2022. \nIn addition, pursuant to the amendments for the non-export credit facilities, we have modified the manner in which such covenants are calculated, temporarily in certain cases and permanently in others, as well as the levels at which our net debt to capitalization covenant will be tested during the period commencing immediately following the end of the waiver period and continuing through the end of 2023. \nThe amendments impose a monthly-tested minimum liquidity covenant of $350.0\u00a0million, which in the case of the non-export credit facilities terminates at the end of the waiver period and in the case of the export credit facilities terminates either in July 2025, or when we pay off all deferred amounts, whichever is earlier. In addition, the amendments to the non-export credit facilities place restrictions on paying cash dividends and effectuating share repurchases through the end of the third quarter of 2022, while the export credit facility amendments require us to prepay any deferred amounts if we elect to issue dividends or complete share repurchases. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the applicable minimum liquidity covenant and we estimate that we will be in compliance for at least the next twelve months. \nAny further covenant waivers may lead to increased costs, increased interest rates, additional restrictive covenants and other available lender protections as may be agreed with our lenders. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain additional waivers in a timely manner, or on acceptable terms. If we require additional waivers and are not able to obtain them or repay the debt facilities, this would lead to an event of default and potential acceleration of amounts due under all of our outstanding debt and derivative contracts.\nDividends\nDuring the first quarter of 2020 we declared a cash dividend on our common stock of $0.78 per share which was paid in the second quarter of 2020.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we agreed with certain of our lenders not to pay dividends or engage in common stock repurchases for so long as our debt covenant waivers are in effect. In addition, in the event we declare a dividend or engage in share repurchases, we will need to repay the amounts deferred under our export credit facilities. Accordingly, we did not declare a dividend during the seventh consecutive quarters ending December 31, 2021. Pursuant to amendments made to these agreements during the first quarter of 2021, the restrictions on paying cash dividends and effectuating share repurchases were extended through and including the third quarter of 2022.\n50\nTable of Contents", "item7a": ">Item\u00a07A.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nFinancial Instruments and Other\nGeneral\nWe are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We try to mitigate these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments pursuant to our hedging practices and policies. The financial impact of these hedging instruments is primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged. We achieve this by closely matching the amount, term and conditions of the derivative instrument with the underlying risk being hedged. Although certain of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify or are not accounted for under hedge accounting, our objective is not to hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. Refer to Note 16.\n Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments \nto our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nInterest Rate Risk \nOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our long-term debt obligations including future interest payments. At December\u00a031, 2021, approximately 65.7% of our long-term debt was effectively fixed as compared to 64.5% as of December\u00a031, 2020. We use interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense.\nMarket risk associated with our long-term fixed rate debt is the potential increase in fair value resulting from a decrease in interest rates.\u00a0We use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our fixed-rate debt to a floating-rate basis to manage this risk. At December\u00a031, 2021, we maintained interest rate swap agreements on the following fixed-rate debt instruments:\nDebt Instrument\nSwap Notional as of December 31, 2021 (In thousands)\nMaturity\nDebt Fixed Rate\nSwap Floating Rate: LIBOR plus\nAll-in Swap Floating Rate as of December 31, 2021\nUnsecured senior notes\n650,000\u00a0\nNovember 2022\n5.25%\n3.63%\n3.79%\n$\n650,000\u00a0\nThese interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges.\nThe estimated fair value of our long-term fixed-rate debt at December\u00a031, 2021 was $13.7 billion, using quoted market prices, where available, or using the present value of expected future cash flows which incorporates risk profile. The fair value of our fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be an asset of $7.7 million as of December\u00a031, 2021, based on the present value of expected future cash flows. A hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates at December\u00a031, 2021 would increase the fair value of our hedged and unhedged long-term fixed-rate debt by approximately $105.3 million and would increase the fair value of our fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements by approximately $5.0 million.\nMarket risk associated with our long-term floating-rate debt is the potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest rates. We use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our floating-rate debt to a fixed-rate basis to manage this risk. A hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our forecasted 2022 interest expense by approximately $48.7 million, assuming no change in foreign currency exchange rates.   \n51\nTable of Contents\nAt December\u00a031, 2021, we maintained interest rate swap agreements on the following floating-rate debt instruments:\nDebt Instrument\nSwap Notional as of December 31, 2021 (In thousands)\nMaturity\nDebt Floating Rate\nAll-in Swap Fixed Rate\nCelebrity Reflection \nterm loan\n$\n163,625\u00a0\nOctober 2024\nLIBOR plus\n0.40%\n2.85%\nQuantum of the Seas\n term loan\n306,250\u00a0\nOctober 2026\nLIBOR plus\n1.30%\n3.74%\nAnthem of the Seas\n term loan\n332,292\u00a0\nApril 2027\nLIBOR plus\n1.30%\n3.86%\nOvation of the Seas\n term loan \n449,583\u00a0\nApril 2028\nLIBOR plus\n1.00%\n3.16%\nHarmony of the Seas\n term loan \n(1)\n427,142\u00a0\nMay 2028\nEURIBOR plus\n1.15%\n2.26%\nOdyssey of the Seas \nterm loan\n(2)\n421,667\u00a0\nOctober 2032\nLIBOR plus\n0.96%\n3.21%\nOdyssey of the Seas\n term loan \n(2)\n191,667\u00a0\nOctober 2032\nLIBOR plus\n0.96%\n2.84%\n$\n2,292,226\u00a0\n___________________________________________________________________\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nInterest rate swap agreements hedging the Euro-denominated term loan for \nHarmony of the Seas\n include EURIBOR zero-floors matching the hedged debt EURIBOR zero-floor.

The effective dates of the $421.7\u00a0million and $191.7\u00a0million interest rate swap agreements are October 2020 and October 2022, respectively. The unsecured term loan for the financing of Odyssey of the Seas was drawn on March 2021.\nThese interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\nThe fair value of our floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be a liability of $70.7 million as of December\u00a031, 2021 based on the present value of expected future cash flows. These interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nOur primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to our ship construction contracts denominated in Euros, our foreign currency denominated debt and our international business operations. On a regular basis, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and, from time to time, we utilize cross-currency swap agreements and collar options to manage portions of the exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. \nThe estimated fair value, as of December\u00a031, 2021, of our Euro-denominated forward contracts associated with our ship construction contracts was a liability of $122.5 million, based on the present value of expected future cash flows. As of December\u00a031, 2021, the aggregate cost of our ships on order, not including ships on order by our Partner Brands, was approximately $12.4 billion, of which we had deposited $800.2 million as of such date. Approximately 59.0% of the aggregate cost of the ships under construction was exposed to fluctuations in the Euro exchange rate at December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, respectively. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the Euro as of December\u00a031, 2021, assuming no changes in comparative interest rates, would result in a $730.4 million increase in the United States dollar cost of the foreign currency denominated ship construction contracts exposed to fluctuations in the Euro exchange rate. Our foreign currency forward contract agreements are accounted for as cash flow or net investment hedges depending on the designation of the related hedge.\nOur international business operations subject us to foreign currency exchange risk.  We transact business in many different foreign currencies and maintain investments in foreign operations which may expose us to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Movements in foreign currency exchange rates may affect the value of our earnings in foreign currencies and cash flows. We manage most of this exposure on a consolidated basis, which allows us to take advantage of any natural offsets. Therefore, weakness in one particular currency might be offset by strengths in other currencies over time. The extent to which one currency is effective as a natural offset of another currency fluctuates over time. In addition, some foreign currency exposures have little to no mitigating natural offsets available. \nWe consider our investments in our foreign operations to be denominated in relatively stable currencies and of a long-term nature. As of December\u00a031, 2021, we maintained a foreign currency forward contract and designated it as a hedge of a portion of our net investment in TUI Cruises of \u20ac245.0 million, or approximately $278.6 million based on the exchange rate at December\u00a031, 2021. This forward currency contract matures in April 2022.\n52\nTable of Contents\nWe also address the exposure of our investments in foreign operations by denominating a portion of our debt in our subsidiaries' and investments' functional currencies and designating it as a hedge of these subsidiaries and investments. We had designated debt as a hedge of our net investments primarily in TUI Cruises of approximately \u20ac97.0 million, or approximately $110.3 million, through December\u00a031, 2021. As of December 31, 2020, we had designated debt as a hedge of our net investments primarily in TUI Cruises of approximately \u20ac215.0 million, or approximately $263.0 million.\nWe have included net gains of approximately $47.7 million and $22.1\u00a0million of foreign-currency transaction remeasurement and changes in the fair value of derivatives in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of \nAccumulated other comprehensive loss\n at December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nOn a regular basis, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and, from time to time, we utilize cross-currency swap agreements and collar options to minimize the volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than our functional currency or the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries. During 2021, we maintained an average of approximately $483.2 million of these foreign currency forward contracts. These instruments are not designated as hedging instruments. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 changes in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts resulted in gains (losses) of approximately $(30.9) million, $(19.0) million and $1.4 million, respectively, which offset gains (losses) arising from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in those same years of $24.3 million, $(1.5) million and $0.4 million, respectively. These changes were recognized in earnings within \nOther income (expense) \nin our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nFuel Price Risk \nOur exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates primarily to the consumption of fuel on our ships. Fuel cost, net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements, as a percentage of our total revenues, was approximately 25.1% in 2021, 16.8% in 2020 and 6.4% in 2019. We use fuel swap agreements to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices.  \nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, we had fuel swap agreements to pay fixed prices for fuel with an aggregate notional amount of approximately $527.3 million, maturing through 2023. These fuel swap agreements are generally accounted for as cash flow hedges. The fuel swap agreements designated as hedges of projected fuel purchases represented 54% of our projected 2022 fuel requirements and 15% of our projected 2023 fuel requirements. The prior suspension of our cruise operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic and our gradual resumption of cruise operations has resulted in reductions to our forecasted fuel purchases. As of December\u00a031, 2021, the Company had outstanding fuel swaps of 231,900 metric tons, maturing in 2022, that do not hedge forecasted fuel consumption. Of these swaps, 115,950 metric tons relate to fuel swap agreements with discontinued hedge accounting, in which we effectively pay fixed prices for our fuel purchases and receive floating prices from the counterparty. The remaining 115,950 tons relate to fuel swap agreements that were not designated as hedges since inception, in which we effectively pay floating prices for our fuel purchases and receive fixed prices from the counterparty. The estimated fair value of our fuel swap agreements at December\u00a031, 2021 was estimated to be an asset of $40.3 million. We estimate that a hypothetical 10% increase in our weighted-average fuel price from that experienced during the year ended December\u00a031, 2021 would increase our forecasted 2022 fuel cost by approximately $50.0 million, net of the impact of fuel swap agreements.", "companyName": "Royal Caribbean Cruises LTD", "cusip": "780087102"}
