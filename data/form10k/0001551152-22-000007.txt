Its D3 binding profile may be linked to observed improvements in the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and to antidepressant effects in bipolar I disorder (bipolar depression). Vraylar is indicated for acute and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adults, acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder in adults and acute treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adults.\nDuopa and Duodopa\n (carbidopa and levodopa).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 AbbVie's levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease is marketed as Duopa in the United States and as Duodopa outside of the United States.\nUbrelvy.    \nUbrelvy (ubrogepant) is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults and is only commercialized in the United States.\nOther neuroscience.    \nOther neuroscience products include\n \nQulipta (atogepant), which is indicated for preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults.\nEye care products.\n AbbVie\u2019s eye care products address unmet needs and new approaches to help preserve and protect patients\u2019 vision. These products are:\nLumigan/Ganfort.    \nLumigan (bimatoprost ophthalmic solution) 0.01% is a once daily, topical prostaglandin analog indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT). Ganfort is a once daily topical fixed combination of bimatoprost 0.03% and timolol 0.5% for the reduction of IOP in adult patients with OAG or OHT. Lumigan is sold in the United States and numerous markets around the world, while Ganfort is approved in the European Union and some markets in South America, the Middle East and Asia.\nAlphagan/Combigan.    \nAlphagan (brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution) is an alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist indicated for the reduction of elevated IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Combigan (brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution) is approved for reducing elevated IOP in patients with glaucoma who require additional or adjunctive IOP-lowering therapy. Both Alphagan and Combigan are available for sale in the United States and numerous markets around the world.\nRestasis.    \nRestasis is a calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressant indicated to increase tear production in patients whose tear production is presumed to be suppressed due to ocular inflammation associated with keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Restasis is approved in the United States and a number of other markets in South America, the Middle East and Asia.\nOther eye care.    \nOther eye care products include Xen, Durysta, Ozurdex, Refresh/Optive and Vuity.\nWomen's health products.\n AbbVie\u2019s women's health products are:\nLo Loestrin\n.    Lo Loestrin Fe is an oral contraceptive. It is indicated for prevention of pregnancy with the lowest dose of estrogen with only 10mcg and is dispensed in a unique 24/2/2 regimen with a two-day hormone-free interval. It is marketed in the U.S. as Lo Loestrin Fe (norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol tablets, ethinyl estradiol tablets and ferrous fumarate tablets) and in select markets outside the U.S. as Lolo.\nOrilissa/Oriahnn.    \nOrilissa (elagolix) is the first and only orally-administered, nonpeptide small molecule gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist specifically developed for women with moderate to severe endometriosis pain.\u00a0It represents the first FDA-approved oral treatment for the management of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis in over a decade. Orilissa inhibits endogenous GnRH signaling by binding competitively to GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland. Administration results in dose-dependent suppression of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, leading to decreased blood concentrations of ovarian sex hormones, estradiol and progesterone. Outside the United States, Orilissa is also launched in Canada. Oriahnn (elagolix, estradiol and norethindrone acetate capsules; elagolix capsules) is a combination prescription medicine used to control heavy menstrual bleeding related to uterine fibroids in women before menopause.\nOther women's health.    \nOther women's health includes Liletta, a sterile, levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system indicated for prevention of pregnancy for up to six years.\nOther key products.\n AbbVie\u2019s other key products include, among other things, treatments for patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV), metabolic and hormone products that target a number of conditions, including exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and hypothyroidism, as well as endocrinology products for the palliative treatment of advanced prostate \n2021 Form 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n4\ncancer, treatment of endometriosis and central precocious puberty and for the preoperative treatment of patients with anemia caused by uterine fibroids. These products are:\nMavyret/Maviret.    \nMavyret (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) is approved in the United States and European Union (Maviret) for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients (12 years and older or weighing at least 45 kilograms) with chronic HCV genotype 1-6 infection without cirrhosis and with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A). It is also indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients (12 years and older or weighing at least 45 kilograms) with HCV genotype 1 infection, who previously have been treated with a regimen containing an HCV NS5A inhibitor or an NS3/4A protease inhibitor, but not both. It is an 8-week, pan-genotypic treatment for patients without cirrhosis and following the EXPEDITION-8 study, also in patients with compensated cirrhosis who are new to treatment. \nCreon.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nCreon (pancrelipase) is a pancreatic enzyme therapy for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, a condition that occurs in patients with cystic fibrosis, chronic pancreatitis and several other conditions.\nLupron.\n    Lupron (leuprolide acetate), which is also marketed as Lucrin and Lupron Depot, is a product for the palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer, treatment of endometriosis and central precocious puberty and for the preoperative treatment of patients with anemia caused by uterine fibroids. Lupron is approved for daily subcutaneous injection and one-month, three-month, four-month and six-month intramuscular injection.\nLinzess/Constella.    \nLinzess (linaclotide) is a once-daily guanylate cyclase-C agonist used in adults to treat irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS\u2011C) and chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC). The product is marketed as Linzess in the United States and as Constella outside of the United States.\nSynthroid.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n Synthroid (levothyroxine sodium tablets, USP) is used in the treatment of hypothyroidism.\nAbbVie has the rights to sell Creon and Synthroid only in the United States.\nMarketing, Sales and Distribution Capabilities\nAbbVie utilizes a combination of dedicated commercial resources, regional commercial resources and distributorships to market, sell and distribute its products worldwide. AbbVie directs its primary marketing efforts toward securing the prescription, or recommendation, of its brand of products by physicians, key opinion leaders and other health care providers. Managed care providers (for example, health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit managers), hospitals and state and federal government agencies (for example, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and the United States Department of Defense) are also important customers. AbbVie also markets directly to consumers themselves, although in the United States many of the company's products must be sold pursuant to a prescription. Outside of the United States, AbbVie focuses its promotional and market access efforts on key opinion leaders, payers, physicians and health systems. AbbVie also provides patient support programs closely related to its products. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic AbbVie has maintained its promotional activities with key stakeholders by leveraging digital engagement where permitted and in compliance with the locally applicable government guidance.\nAbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. Although AbbVie's business does not have significant seasonality, AbbVie's product revenues may be affected by end customer and retail buying patterns, fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels and other factors.\nIn the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. In 2021, three wholesale distributors (McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health,\u00a0Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corporation) accounted for substantially all of AbbVie's pharmaceutical product sales in the United States. No individual wholesaler accounted for greater than 37% of AbbVie's 2021 gross revenues in the United States. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served.\nCertain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has no single customer that, if the customer were lost, would have a material adverse effect on the company's business. No material portion of AbbVie's business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government. Orders are generally filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to AbbVie's business.\nCompetition\nThe markets for AbbVie's products are highly competitive. AbbVie competes with other research-based pharmaceuticals and biotechnology companies that discover, manufacture, market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products, therapies \n5 \n \n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n2021 Form 10-K\nand biologics. For example, Humira competes with anti-TNF products, JAK inhibitors and other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and Mavyret/Maviret competes with other available HCV treatment options. In addition, in the past few years, a number of other companies have started to develop, have successfully developed and/or are currently marketing products that are being positioned as competitors to Botox. The search for technological innovations in pharmaceutical products is a significant aspect of competition. The introduction of new products by competitors and changes in medical practices and procedures can result in product obsolescence. Price is also a competitive factor. In addition, the substitution of generic pharmaceutical products for branded conventional (small-molecule) pharmaceutical products creates competitive pressures on AbbVie's products that do not have patent protection. New products or treatments brought to market by AbbVie\u2019s competitors could cause revenues for AbbVie\u2019s products to decrease due to price reductions and sales volume decreases.\nBiosimilars.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Competition for AbbVie\u2019s biologic products is affected by the approval of follow-on biologics, also known as \u201cbiosimilars.\u201d Biologics have added major therapeutic options for the treatment of many diseases, including some for which therapies were unavailable or inadequate. The cost of developing and producing biologic therapies is typically dramatically higher than for small molecule medications, and many biologic medications are used for ongoing treatment of chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, or for the treatment of previously untreatable cancer. Significant investments in biologics infrastructure and manufacturing are necessary to produce biologic products.\nHumira is now facing direct biosimilar competition in Europe and other countries, and AbbVie will continue to face competitive pressure from these biologics and from orally administered products.\nIn the United States, the FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FFDCA), the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and the regulations implementing these statutes. The enactment of federal health care reform legislation in March 2010 provided a pathway for approval of biosimilars under the PHSA, but the approval process for, and science behind, biosimilars is complex. Approval by the FDA is dependent upon many factors, including a showing that the biosimilar is \"highly similar\" to the original product and has no clinically meaningful differences from the original product in terms of safety, purity and potency. The types of data that could ordinarily be required in an application to show similarity may include analytical data, bioequivalence studies and studies to demonstrate chemical similarity, animal studies (including toxicity studies) and clinical studies. \nFurthermore, the law provides that only a biosimilar product that is determined to be \"interchangeable\" will be considered by the FDA as substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product. To prove that a biosimilar product is interchangeable, the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the original biologic product in any given patient, and if the product is administered more than once in a patient, that safety risks and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching. The law continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its full ultimate impact, implementation and meaning remains subject to uncertainty.\nIntellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity\nGenerally, upon approval, products may be entitled to certain kinds of exclusivity under applicable intellectual property and regulatory regimes. AbbVie\u2019s intellectual property is materially valuable to the company, and AbbVie seeks patent protection, where available, in all significant markets and/or countries for each product in development. In the United States, the expiration date for patents is 20\u00a0years after the filing date. Given that patents relating to pharmaceutical products are often obtained early in the development process and given the amount of time needed to complete clinical trials and other development activities required for regulatory approval, the length of time between product launch and patent expiration is significantly less than 20\u00a0years. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act) permits a patent holder to seek a patent extension, commonly called a \u201cpatent term restoration,\u201d for patents on products (or processes for making the product) regulated by the FFDCA. The length of the patent extension is roughly based on 50\u00a0percent of the period of time from the filing of an Investigational New Drug Application (NDA) for a compound to the submission of the NDA for such compound, plus 100\u00a0percent of the time period from NDA submission to regulatory approval. The extension, however, cannot exceed five years and the patent term remaining after regulatory approval cannot exceed 14\u00a0years. Biological products licensed under the PHSA are similarly eligible for terms of patent restoration.\nPharmaceutical products may be entitled to other forms of legal or regulatory exclusivity upon approval. The scope, length and requirements for each of these exclusivities vary both in the United States and in other jurisdictions. In the United States, if the FDA approves a conventional drug product that contains an active ingredient not previously approved, the product is typically entitled to five years of non-patent regulatory exclusivity. Specific conditions of use approved for \n2021 Form 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n6\nindividual products may also be entitled to three years of exclusivity if approval was based on the FDA\u2019s reliance on new clinical studies essential to approval submitted by the NDA applicant. If the NDA applicant studies the product for use by children, the FDA may grant pediatric exclusivity, which extends by 180\u00a0days all existing exclusivities (patent and regulatory) related to the product. For products that are either used to treat conditions that afflict a relatively small population or for which there is not a reasonable expectation that the research and development costs will be recovered, the FDA may designate the pharmaceutical as an orphan drug and grant it seven years of exclusivity. Other types of regulatory exclusivity may also be available, such as Generating New Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) exclusivity, which can provide new antibiotic or new antifungal drugs an additional five years of exclusivity to be added to certain exclusivities already provided for by law.\nApplicable laws and regulations dictate the scope of any exclusivity to which a product or particular characteristics of a product is entitled upon approval in any particular country. In certain instances, regulatory exclusivity may offer protection where patent protection is no longer available or for a period of time in excess of patent protection. It is not possible to estimate for each product in development the total period and scope of exclusivity to which it may become entitled until regulatory approval is obtained or sometimes even later. However, given the length of time required to complete clinical development of a pharmaceutical product, the periods of exclusivity that might be achieved in any individual case would not generally be expected to exceed a minimum of three years and a maximum of 14\u00a0years. These estimates do not consider other factors, such as the difficulty of recreating the manufacturing process for a particular product or other proprietary knowledge that may delay the introduction of a generic or other follow-on product after the expiration of applicable patent and other regulatory exclusivity periods.\nBiologics may be entitled to exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, which was passed on March\u00a023, 2010 as Title VII to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The law provides a pathway for approval of biosimilars following the expiration of 12\u00a0years of regulatory exclusivity for the innovator biologic and a potential additional 180\u00a0day-extension term for conducting pediatric studies. Biologics are also eligible for orphan drug exclusivity, as discussed above. The law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement, validity and enforceability. The European Union has also created a pathway for approval of biosimilars and has published guidelines for approval of certain biosimilar products. The more complex nature of biologics and biosimilar products has led to close regulatory scrutiny over follow-on biosimilar products, which can reduce the effect of biosimilars on sales of the innovator biologic as compared to the sales erosion caused by generic versions of small molecule pharmaceutical products.\nAbbVie owns or has licensed rights to a substantial number of patents and patent applications. AbbVie licenses or owns a patent portfolio of thousands of patent families, each of which includes United States patent applications and/or issued patents and may also contain the non-United States counterparts to these patents and applications.\nThese patents and applications, including various patents that expire during the period 2022 to the early 2040s, in aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of AbbVie\u2019s business. However, AbbVie believes that no single patent, license, trademark (or related group of patents, licenses, or trademarks), except for those related to adalimumab (which is sold under the trademark Humira), are material in relation to the company\u2019s business as a whole. The United States composition of matter (that is, compound) patent covering adalimumab expired in December 2016, and the equivalent European Union patent expired in October 2018 in the majority of European Union countries. In the United States, non-composition of matter patents covering adalimumab expire no earlier than 2022. AbbVie has entered into settlement and license agreements with several adalimumab biosimilar manufactures.\u00a0Under the agreements, the licenses in the United States will begin in 2023 and the licenses in Europe began in 2018.\nIn addition, the following patents, licenses and trademarks are significant: those related to ibrutinib (which is sold under the trademark Imbruvica) and those related to risankizumab (which is sold under the trademark Skyrizi). The United States composition of matter patent covering ibrutinib is expected to expire in 2027, however no generic entry for any ibrutinib product is expected prior to March 30, 2032, assuming pediatric exclusivity is granted. The United States composition of matter patent covering risankizumab is expected to expire in 2033.\nAbbVie may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect its technology. AbbVie seeks to protect its technology and product candidates, in part, by confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and collaborators. These agreements may be breached and AbbVie may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, AbbVie\u2019s trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that AbbVie\u2019s employees, consultants, advisors, contractors and collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.\n7 \n \n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n2021 Form 10-K\nLicensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements\nIn addition to its independent efforts to develop and market products, AbbVie enters into arrangements such as acquisitions, option-to-acquire agreements, licensing arrangements, option-to-license arrangements, strategic alliances, co-promotion arrangements, co-development and co-marketing agreements and joint ventures. The acquisitions and option-to-acquire agreements typically include, among other terms and conditions, non-refundable purchase price payments or option fees, option exercise payments, milestones or earn-outs and other customary terms and obligations. The licensing and other arrangements typically include, among other terms and conditions, non-refundable upfront license fees, option fees and option exercise payments, milestone payments and royalty and/or profit sharing obligations. See Note 5, \"Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements\u2014Other Licensing\u00a0& Acquisitions Activity,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nThird Party Agreements\nAbbVie has agreements with third parties for process development, product distribution, analytical services and manufacturing of certain products. AbbVie procures certain products and services from a limited number of suppliers and, in some cases, a single supply source. In addition, AbbVie has agreements with third parties for active pharmaceutical ingredient and product manufacturing, formulation and development services, fill, finish and packaging services, transportation and distribution and logistics services for certain products. AbbVie does not believe that these manufacturing related agreements are material because AbbVie's business is not substantially dependent on any individual agreement. In most cases, AbbVie maintains alternate supply relationships that it can utilize without undue disruption of its manufacturing processes if a third party fails to perform its contractual obligations. AbbVie seeks to maintain sufficient inventory of product to minimize the impact of any supply disruption.\nAbbVie is also party to certain collaborations and other arrangements, as discussed in Note 5, \"Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements\u2014Other Licensing\u00a0& Acquisitions Activity,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nSources and Availability of Raw Materials\nAbbVie purchases, in the ordinary course of business, raw materials and supplies essential to its operations from numerous suppliers around the world. In addition, certain medical devices and components necessary for the manufacture of AbbVie products are provided by unaffiliated third party suppliers. Despite the disruption to the global supply chain caused by COVID-19, AbbVie has continued to supply patients with no material supply impact, except for the previously-disclosed near-term supply issues impacting Lupron. Given the general increased global volatility due to the pandemic, AbbVie is monitoring and taking actions to mitigate potential supply shortages which may impact the fulfillment of product demand.\nResearch and Development Activities\nAbbVie makes a significant investment in research and development and has numerous compounds (and complementary devices) in clinical development, including potential treatments for complex, life-threatening diseases. AbbVie's ability to discover and develop new compounds is enhanced by the company's use of integrated discovery and development project teams, which include chemists, biologists, physicians and pharmacologists who work on the same compounds as a team. AbbVie also partners with third parties, such as biotechnology companies, other pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions to identify and prioritize promising new treatments that complement and enhance AbbVie\u2019s existing portfolio. AbbVie also supplements its research and development efforts with acquisitions.\nThe research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease. If preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful, the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases:\n\u2022\nPhase\u00a01\u2014 involves the first human tests in a small number of healthy volunteers or patients to assess safety, tolerability and doses for later phases.\n\u2022\nPhase\u00a02\u2014 tests different doses of the drug in a disease state in order to assess efficacy.\n\u2022\nPhase\u00a03\u2014 tests a drug that demonstrates favorable results in the earlier phases in a significantly larger patient population to further demonstrate efficacy and safety in order to meet requirements to enable global approval.\nPreclinical data and clinical trials from all of the development phases provide the data required to prepare and submit an NDA, a Biological License Application (BLA) or other submission for regulatory approval to the FDA or similar government agencies outside the United States. The specific requirements (e.g.,\u00a0scope of clinical trials) for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions.\n2021 Form 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n8\nThe research and development process from discovery through a new drug launch typically takes 8 to 12\u00a0years and can be even longer. The research and development of new pharmaceutical products has a significant amount of inherent uncertainty. There is no guarantee when, or if, a molecule will receive the regulatory approval required to launch a new drug or indication.\nIn addition to the development of new products, delivery devices, and new formulations, research and development projects also may include Phase 4 trials, sometimes called post-marketing studies. For such projects, clinical trials are designed and conducted to collect additional data regarding, among other parameters, the benefits and risks of an approved drug.\nRegulation\u2014Discovery and Clinical Development\nUnited States.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Securing approval to market a new pharmaceutical product in the United States requires substantial effort and financial resources and takes several years to complete. The applicant must complete preclinical tests and submit protocols to the FDA before commencing clinical trials. Clinical trials are intended to establish the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product and typically are conducted in sequential phases, although the phases may overlap or be combined. If the required clinical testing is successful, the results are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP).\nCompliance with regulatory requirements is assured through periodic, announced or unannounced inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and these inspections associated with clinical development may include the sponsor, investigator sites, laboratories, hospitals and manufacturing facilities of AbbVie's subcontractors or other third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, including rejection of an NDA or BLA.\nEven if an NDA or a BLA receives approval, the applicant must comply with post-approval requirements. For example, holders of an approval must report adverse reactions, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional materials and activities. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and certain changes to the manufacturing procedures and finished product must be submitted and approved by the FDA prior to implementation. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural and record keeping requirements. In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product's safety or efficacy after commercialization, which may require additional clinical trials, patient registries, observational data or additional work on chemistry, manufacturing and controls. Any post-approval regulatory obligations, and the cost of complying with such obligations, could expand in the future. Further, the FDA continues to regulate product labeling, and prohibits the promotion of products for unapproved or \u201coff-label\u201d uses along with other labeling restrictions.\nOutside the United States.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0AbbVie is subject to similar regulatory requirements outside the United States for approval and marketing of pharmaceutical products. AbbVie must obtain approval of a clinical trial application or product from applicable supervising regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in target markets. The approval requirements and process for each country can vary, and the time required to obtain approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval in the United States. For example, AbbVie may submit marketing authorizations in the European Union under either a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and many pharmaceutical products and provides for a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. Under the centralized procedure, a single marketing authorization application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency. After the agency evaluates the application, it makes a recommendation to the European Commission, which then makes the final determination on whether to approve the application. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of individual national approval decisions and is available for products that are not subject to the centralized procedure.\nIn Japan, applications for approval of a new product are made through the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). Japan-specific trials and/or bridging studies to demonstrate that the non-Japanese clinical data applies to Japanese patients may be required. After completing a comprehensive review, the PMDA reports to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, which then approves or denies the application.\nSimilarly, applications for a new product in China are submitted to the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) of the National Medical Products Administration for technical review and approval of a product for marketing in China. Clinical data in Chinese subjects are usually required to support approval in China, requiring the inclusion of China in global pivotal studies, or a separate China/Asian clinical trial.\n9 \n \n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n2021 Form 10-K\nThe regulatory process in many emerging markets continues to evolve. Many emerging markets, including those in Asia, generally require regulatory approval to have been obtained in a large developed market (such as the United States or Europe) before the country will begin or complete its regulatory review process. Similar to the requirements in Japan and China, certain countries (notably South Korea, Taiwan, India and Russia) also generally require that local clinical studies be conducted in order to support regulatory approval in the country.\nThe requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and product licensing also vary. In addition, post-approval regulatory obligations such as adverse event reporting and cGMP compliance generally apply and may vary by country. For example, after a marketing authorization has been granted in the European Union, periodic safety reports must be submitted and other pharmacovigilance measures may be required (such as Risk Management Plans).\nRegulation\u2014Commercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing\nThe manufacturing, marketing, sale, promotion and distribution of AbbVie's products are subject to comprehensive government regulation. Government regulation by various national, regional, federal, state and local agencies, both in the United States and other countries, addresses (among other matters) inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, labeling, packaging, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-marketing surveillance, record keeping, storage and disposal practices. AbbVie's operations are also affected by trade regulations in many countries that limit the import of raw materials and finished products and by laws and regulations that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace (including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, which provide guidance on corporate interactions with government officials) and require safeguards for the protection of personal data. In addition, AbbVie is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback and false claims laws in the United States. Prescription drug manufacturers such as AbbVie are also subject to taxes, as well as application, product, user and other fees.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects AbbVie's business. Among other effects, health care regulations substantially increase the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products. AbbVie expects compliance with these regulations to continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product's production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties.\nIn addition to regulatory initiatives, AbbVie's business can be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy and outcomes of health care products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants, government agencies and others. These studies can lead to updates to the data regarding utilization, safety and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, these studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of, or limitations on, marketing of such products domestically or worldwide, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use.\nAccess to human health care products continues to be a subject of oversight, investigation and action by governmental agencies, legislative bodies and private organizations in the United States and other countries. A major focus is cost containment. Efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector, notably by health care payers and providers, which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures. AbbVie expects insurers and providers to continue attempts to reduce the cost of health care products. Outside the United States, many countries control the price of health care products directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing, coverage limitations, or compulsory licensing. Political and budgetary pressures in the United States and in other countries may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on AbbVie's products for the foreseeable future.\n\u00a0United States.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specifically, U.S. federal laws require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay certain statutorily-prescribed rebates to state Medicaid programs on prescription drugs reimbursed under state Medicaid plans, and the efforts by states to seek additional rebates may affect AbbVie's business. Similarly, the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as a prerequisite to participation in Medicaid and other federal health care programs, requires that manufacturers extend additional discounts on pharmaceutical products to various federal agencies, including the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense and Public Health Service entities and institutions. In addition, recent legislative changes would require similarly discounted prices to be offered to TRICARE program beneficiaries. The Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 also established the 340B drug discount program, which requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide products at reduced prices to various designated health care entities and facilities.\nIn the United States, most states also have generic substitution legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturer's generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed. In \n2021 Form 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n10\naddition, the federal government follows a diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment system for certain institutional services provided under Medicare or Medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system (PPS) for services delivered in hospital outpatient, nursing home and home health settings. DRG and PPS entitle a health care facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis and/or procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment, thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many health care products. Medicare reimburses Part\u00a0B drugs based on average sales price plus a certain percentage to account for physician administration costs, which have been reduced in the hospital outpatient setting. Medicare enters into contracts with private plans to negotiate prices for most patient-administered medicine delivered under Part\u00a0D.\nUnder the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (together, the Affordable Care Act), AbbVie pays a fee related to its pharmaceuticals sales to government programs. In addition, AbbVie provides a discount of 70% for branded prescription drugs sold to patients who fall into the Medicare Part\u00a0D coverage gap, or \"donut hole.\"\nThe Affordable Care Act also includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosure. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level in the United States, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring disclosure of interactions with health care professionals. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties.\nAbbVie expects debate to continue during 2022 at all government levels worldwide over the marketing, availability, method of delivery and payment for health care products and services. AbbVie believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect access to health care products and services, increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, change health care delivery systems, create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceuticals industry, or require additional reporting and disclosure. It is difficult to predict the extent to which AbbVie or the health care industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above.\nEuropean Union.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The European Union has adopted directives and other legislation governing labeling, advertising, distribution, supply, pharmacovigilance and marketing of pharmaceutical products. Such legislation provides mandatory standards throughout the European Union and permits member states to supplement these standards with additional regulations. European governments also regulate pharmaceutical product prices through their control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers. As a result, patients are unlikely to use a pharmaceutical product that is not reimbursed by the government. In many European countries, the government either regulates the pricing of a new product at launch or subsequent to launch through direct price controls or reference pricing. In recent years, many countries have also imposed new or additional cost containment measures on pharmaceutical products. Differences between national pricing regimes create price differentials within the European Union that can lead to significant parallel trade in pharmaceutical products.\nMost governments also promote generic substitution by mandating or permitting a pharmacist to substitute a different manufacturer's generic version of a pharmaceutical product for the one prescribed and by permitting or mandating that health care professionals prescribe generic versions in certain circumstances. Many governments are also following a similar path for biosimilar therapies. In addition, governments use reimbursement lists to limit the pharmaceutical products that are eligible for reimbursement by national health care systems.\n\u00a0Japan.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Japan, the National Health Insurance system maintains a Drug Price List specifying which pharmaceutical products are eligible for reimbursement, and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare sets the prices of the products on this list. The government generally introduces price cut rounds every other year and also mandates price decreases for specific products. New products judged innovative or useful, that are indicated for pediatric use, or that target orphan or small population diseases, however, may be eligible for a pricing premium. The government has also promoted the use of generics, where available.\n\u00a0Emerging Markets.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Many emerging markets take steps to reduce pharmaceutical product prices, in some cases through direct price controls and in others through the promotion of generic/biosimilar alternatives to branded pharmaceuticals.\nSince AbbVie markets its products worldwide, certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines must also meet other local regulatory requirements. Certain additional risks are inherent in conducting business outside the United States, including price and currency exchange controls, changes in currency exchange rates, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization and other governmental action.\n11 \n \n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n2021 Form 10-K\nRegulation \u2013 Medical Devices\nMedical devices are subject to regulation by the FDA, state agencies and foreign government health authorities. FDA regulations, as well as various U.S. federal and state laws, govern the development, clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, record keeping and marketing of medical device products agencies in the United States. AbbVie\u2019s medical device product candidates, including AbbVie\u2019s breast implants,\n \nmust undergo rigorous clinical testing and an extensive government regulatory clearance or approval process prior to sale in the United States and other countries. The lengthy process of clinical development and submissions for clearance or approval, and the continuing need for compliance with applicable laws and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources. Regulatory clearance or approval, when and if obtained, may be limited in scope, and may significantly limit the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed. Cleared or approved products and their manufacturers are subject to ongoing review, and discovery of previously unknown problems with products may result in restrictions on their manufacture, sale and/or use or require their withdrawal from the market.\nUnited States\n.     AbbVie\u2019s medical device products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device AbbVie markets in the United States must have a 510(k) clearance or a Premarket Approval Application (PMA) in accordance with the FFDCA and its implementing regulations. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes, depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of controls that are needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Devices deemed to pose a lower risk are placed in either Class I or Class II, and devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or a device deemed to be not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III. In general, a Class III device cannot be marketed in the United States unless the FDA approves the device after submission of a PMA, and any changes to the device subsequent to initial FDA approval must also be reviewed and approved by the FDA. The majority of AbbVie\u2019s medical device products, including AbbVie\u2019s breast implants, are regulated as Class III medical devices. A Class III device may have significant additional obligations imposed in its conditions of approval, and the time in which it takes to obtain approval can be long. Compliance with regulatory requirements is assured through periodic, unannounced facility inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of AbbVie\u2019s subcontractors or other third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: warning letters or untitled letters; fines, injunctions and civil penalties; recall or seizure of AbbVie\u2019 products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing AbbVie\u2019 request for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products; withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals that are already granted; and criminal prosecution.\nA clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application and is sometimes required for a 510(k) premarket notification. Clinical trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption (IDE), which must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. A study sponsor must obtain approval for its IDE from the FDA, and it must also obtain approval of its study from the Institutional Review Board overseeing the trial. The results of clinical testing may not be sufficient to obtain approval of the investigational device.\nOnce a device is approved, the manufacture and distribution of the device remains subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including Quality System Regulation requirements, which involve design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process. Medical device manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments and list their manufactured devices with the FDA and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with regulatory requirements. Manufacturers must also report to the FDA if their devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that could likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, or if the manufacturer conducts a field correction or product recall or removal to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the FFDCA that may present a health risk. Further, the FDA continues to regulate device labeling, and prohibits the promotion of products for unapproved or \u201coff-label\u201d uses along with other labeling restrictions.\nEuropean Union.    \nMedical device products that are marketed in the European Union must comply with the requirements of the Medical Device Regulation (the MDR), which came into effect in May 2021. The MDR provides for regulatory oversight with respect to the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices to ensure that medical devices marketed in the European Union are safe and effective for their intended uses. Medical devices that comply with the MDR are entitled to bear a Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne marking evidencing such compliance and may be marketed in the European Union. Failure to comply with these domestic and international regulatory requirements could affect AbbVie\u2019s ability to market and sell AbbVie\u2019s products in these countries.\n2021 Form 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n12\nEnvironmental Matters\nAbbVie believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection. Regulations under federal and state environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations. AbbVie's capital expenditures for pollution control in 2021 were approximately $17 million and operating expenditures were approximately $33 million. In 2022, capital expenditures for pollution control are estimated to be approximately $14 million and operating expenditures are estimated to be approximately $34 million.\nAbbott was identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations and/or remediations at several locations in the United States, including Puerto Rico, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. Some of these locations were transferred to AbbVie in connection with the separation and distribution, and AbbVie has become a party to these investigations and remediations. Abbott was also engaged in remediation at several other sites, some of which have been transferred to AbbVie in connection with the separation and distribution, in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency or similar agencies. While it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities, AbbVie believes that such costs, together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, should not have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.\nEmployees\nAbbVie employed approximately 50,000 employees in over 70 countries as of January\u00a031, 2022. Outside the United States, some of AbbVie's employees are represented by unions or works councils. AbbVie believes that it has good relations with its employees.\nHuman Capital Management\nAttracting, retaining and providing meaningful growth and development opportunities to AbbVie's employees is critical to the company's success in making a remarkable impact on people\u2019s lives around the world. AbbVie leverages numerous resources to identify and enhance strategic and leadership capability, foster employee engagement and create a culture where diverse talent is productive and engaged. AbbVie invests in its employees through competitive compensation, benefits and employee support programs and offers best-in-class development and leadership opportunities. AbbVie has developed a deep talent base through ongoing investment in functional and leadership training and by sourcing world-class external talent, ensuring a sustainable talent pipeline. AbbVie continuously cultivates and enhances its working culture and embraces equality, diversity and inclusion as fundamental to the company's mission.\nAttracting and Developing Talent.    \nAttracting and developing high-performing talent is essential to AbbVie\u2019s continued success. AbbVie implements detailed talent attraction strategies, with an emphasis on STEM skill sets, a diverse talent base and other critical skillsets, including drug discovery, clinical development, market access and business development. AbbVie also invests in competitive compensation and benefits programs. In addition to offering a comprehensive suite of benefits ranging from medical and dental coverage to retirement, disability and life insurance programs, AbbVie also provides health promotion programs, mental health awareness campaigns and employee assistance programs in several countries, financial wellness support, on-site health screenings and immunizations in several countries and on-site fitness and rehabilitation centers. In addition, the AbbVie Employee Assistance Fund (a part of the AbbVie Foundation) supports two programs for global employees: the AbbVie Possibilities Scholarship for children of employees, which is an annual merit-based scholarship for use at accredited colleges, universities or vocational-technical schools; and the Employee Relief Program, which is financial assistance to support short term needs of employees when faced with large-scale disasters (e.g. a hurricane), individual disasters (e.g. a home fire) or financial hardship (e.g. the death of a spouse). Finally, AbbVie empowers managers and their teams with tools, tips and guidelines on effectively managing workloads, managing teams from a distance and supporting flexible work practices.\nNew AbbVie employees are given a tailored onboarding experience for faster integration and to support performance. AbbVie's mentorship program allows employees to self-nominate as mentors or mentees and facilitates meaningful relationships supporting employees\u2019 career and development goals. \nAbbVie also provides structured, broad-based development opportunities, focusing on high-performance skills and leadership training. AbbVie's talent philosophy holds leaders accountable for building a high-performing organization, and the company provides development opportunities to all levels of leadership. AbbVie's Learn, Develop, Perform program offers year-long, self-directed leadership education, supplemented with tools and resources, and leverages leaders as role models and teachers. In addition, the foundation to AbbVie's leadership pipeline is the company's Professional Development \n13 \n \n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n2021 Form 10-K\nPrograms, which attract graduates, postgraduates and post-doctoral talent to participate in formal development programs lasting up to three years, with the objective of strengthening functional and leadership capabilities.\nCulture.    \nAbbVie\u2019s shared values of transforming lives, acting with integrity, driving innovation, embracing diversity and inclusion and serving the community form the core of the company's culture. AbbVie articulates the behaviors associated with these values in the Ways We Work, a core set of working behaviors that emphasize how the company achieves results is equally as important as achieving them. The Ways We Work are designed to ensure that every AbbVie employee is aware of the company's cultural expectations. AbbVie integrates the Ways We Work into all talent processes, forming the basis for assessing performance, prioritizing development and ultimately rewarding employees. AbbVie believes its culture creates strong engagement, which is measured regularly through a confidential, third party all-employee survey, and this engagement supports AbbVie\u2019s mission of making a remarkable impact on people\u2019s lives.\nEquity, Equality, Diversity & Inclusion (EED&I).    \nA cornerstone of AbbVie\u2019s human capital management approach is to prioritize fostering an inclusive and diverse workforce. In 2019, AbbVie adopted a five-year Equality, Diversity & Inclusion roadmap that defines key global focus areas, objectives and associated initiatives, and includes implementation plans organized by business function and geography. AbbVie\u2019s senior leaders have adopted formal goals aligned with executing this strategy. In recent years, AbbVie's board of directors has prioritized oversight of AbbVie's response to the U.S. racial justice movement, including overseeing internal programs designed to ensure that AbbVie is attracting, retaining and developing diverse talent. Through December 2021, women represented 51 percent of management positions globally and in the United States, 35 percent of AbbVie's workforce was comprised of members of historically underrepresented populations, an increase from 2020. Further, AbbVie is committed to pay equity and conducts pay equity analyses annually. A critical component of AbbVie's strategy is to instill an inclusive mindset in all AbbVie leaders and employees, so the company can realize the full value of a diverse workforce from recruitment through retirement. AbbVie recently launched a new resource for people who manage others to reinforce the importance of EED&I to the business, educate leaders on inclusive recruiting practices and modeling inclusive behavior, and encourage participation in the company's inclusive culture learning opportunities. AbbVie's Employee Resource Groups also help the company nurture an inclusive culture by building community, hosting awareness events and providing leadership and career opportunities. In 2021, AbbVie reiterated its commitment to racial equality and social justice by, among other things, expanding its employee matching program to $3-to-$1 for donations to civil rights nonprofits fostering racial equity and by reaffirming its commitment to clinical trial diversity. Additional information about AbbVie's efforts on racial equality and social justice is provided on the company's website at: https://abbvie.com/our-company/equality-inclusion-diversity/our-commitment-to-racial-justice.html.\nCOVID-19 Health and Safety.\n \nAbbVie has effectively prioritized the health and safety of its employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, while continuing to drive strong business performance. AbbVie implemented, among other things, temporary office and facility closures and establishment of new safety and cleaning protocols and procedures; regular communication regarding the effect of the pandemic on AbbVie's business and employees; establishment of physical distancing procedures, modification of workspaces and provision of personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies for employees; provision of on-site vaccinations and temperature screenings; a variety of testing and vaccination resources including on-site vaccinations and on-site and at-home testing and COVID case management programs; and remote working accommodations and related services to support employees\u2019 needs for flexibility. In addition, \nCOVID-19 is a covered event under the AbbVie Employee Assistance Fund's Employee Relief Program, entitling eligible AbbVie employees and their families to financial assistance to pay for mortgage/rent, utilities, food, childcare and medical expenses not covered by insurance. AbbVie also provided paid leave and other support and accommodations to the company's employees with relevant medical, pharmaceutical, research and development, science, public health and public safety skills, knowledge, training and experience who desired or were requested or mandated to serve as volunteers during the pandemic. Lastly, AbbVie\u2019s commitment to employees has been evidenced by no\n workforce reductions and no salary reductions associated with COVID-19\n.\nInternet Information\nCopies of AbbVie's Annual Reports on Form\u00a010-K, Quarterly Reports on Form\u00a010-Q, Current Reports on Form\u00a08-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section\u00a013(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge through AbbVie's investor relations website (\ninvestors.abbvie.com\n) as soon as reasonably practicable after AbbVie electronically files the material with, or furnishes it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nAbbVie's corporate governance guidelines, outline of directorship qualifications, code of business conduct and the charters of AbbVie's audit committee, compensation committee, nominations and governance committee and public policy committee are all available on AbbVie's investor relations website (\ninvestors.abbvie.com\n).\n2021 Form 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n14", "item1a": ">ITEM 1A.\u00a0RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Form\u00a010-K in evaluating AbbVie and AbbVie's common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect AbbVie's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. The risk factors generally have been separated into two groups: risks related to AbbVie's business and risks related to AbbVie's common stock. Based on the information currently known to it, AbbVie believes that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting it in each of these categories of risks. However, the risks and uncertainties AbbVie faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below and may not be in order of importance or probability of occurrence. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to AbbVie or that AbbVie currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nIf any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, these events could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In such case, the trading price of AbbVie's common stock could decline.\nRisks Related to AbbVie's Business\nPublic health outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics, such as the coronavirus (COVID-19), have had, and could in the future have, an adverse impact on AbbVie\u2019s operations and financial condition.\nPublic health outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics have had, and could in the future have, an adverse impact on AbbVie\u2019s operations and financial condition. The continuing pandemic caused by the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused many countries, including the United States, to declare national emergencies and implement preventive measures such as travel bans and shelter in place or total lock-down orders, some of which have eased. The continuation or re-implementation of these bans and orders remains uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused AbbVie to modify its business practices (including instituting remote work for many of AbbVie\u2019s employees), and AbbVie may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as AbbVie determines are in the best interests of AbbVie\u2019s employees, patients, customers and business partners. \nWhile the impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie\u2019s operations, including, among others, its manufacturing and supply chain, sales and marketing, commercial and clinical trial operations, to date has not been material, AbbVie has experienced lower new patient starts in certain products and markets. The impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie over the long-term is uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. The extent of the adverse impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie\u2019s operations will depend on the extent and severity of the continued spread of COVID-19 globally, the timing and nature of actions taken to respond to COVID-19 and the resulting economic consequences. Ultimately, efforts to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 may not completely prevent AbbVie's business from being adversely affected and future impacts remain uncertain.\nThe expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings.\nAbbVie relies on patent, trademark and other intellectual property protection in the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of its products. In particular, patent protection is, in the aggregate, important in AbbVie's marketing of pharmaceutical products in the United States and most major markets outside of the United States. Patents covering AbbVie products normally provide market exclusivity, which is important for the profitability of many of AbbVie's products.\nAs patents for certain of its products expire, AbbVie will or could face competition from lower priced generic or biosimilar products. The expiration or loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by substitutes that may significantly reduce sales for that product in a short amount of time. If AbbVie's competitive position is compromised because of generics, biosimilars or otherwise, it could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business and results of operations. In addition, proposals emerge from time to time for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs or biosimilars. Any such proposals that are enacted into law could increase the impact of generic competition.\nAbbVie's principal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in Item 1, \"Business\u2014Intellectual Property Protection and Regulatory Exclusivity\" and Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u2014Results of Operations,\" and litigation regarding these patents is described in Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings.\" The United States composition of matter patent for Humira, which is AbbVie's largest product and had worldwide net revenues of approximately $20.7 billion in 2021, expired in December 2016, and the equivalent European Union patent expired in the majority of European Union countries in October 2018.\n15 \n \n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n2021 Form 10-K\nAbbVie's major products could lose patent protection earlier than expected, which could adversely affect AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings.\nThird parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent AbbVie's patents and patent applications. For example, manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products file, and may continue to file, Abbreviated New Drug Applications with the FDA seeking to market generic forms of AbbVie's products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by AbbVie by asserting that the patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. In addition, petitioners have filed, and may continue to file, challenges to the validity of AbbVie patents under the 2011 Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, which created \ninter partes\n review and post grant review procedures for challenging patent validity in administrative proceedings at the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\nAlthough most of the challenges to AbbVie's intellectual property have come from other businesses, governments may also challenge intellectual property rights. For example, court decisions and potential legislation relating to patents, such as legislation regarding biosimilars, and other regulatory initiatives may result in further erosion of intellectual property protection. In addition, certain governments outside the United States have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be sought to further their domestic policies or on the basis of national emergencies, such as HIV/AIDS. If triggered, compulsory licenses could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those jurisdictions and negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations.\nAbbVie normally responds to challenges by vigorously defending its patents, including by filing patent infringement lawsuits. Patent litigation, administrative proceedings and other challenges to AbbVie's patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive AbbVie of market exclusivity for a patented product. To the extent AbbVie's intellectual property is successfully challenged, circumvented or weakened, or to the extent such intellectual property does not allow AbbVie to compete effectively, AbbVie's business will suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce AbbVie's intellectual property rights or require compulsory licensing of AbbVie's intellectual property, AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced.\nA third party's intellectual property may prevent AbbVie from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's future profitability and financial condition.\nThird parties may claim that an AbbVie product infringes upon their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require AbbVie to enter into license agreements. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject AbbVie to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale, or use of the affected AbbVie product or products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's profitability and financial condition.\nAny significant event that adversely affects Humira revenues could have a material and negative impact on AbbVie's results of operations and cash flows.\nHumira accounted for approximately 37%\u00a0of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2021. Any significant event that adversely affects Humira's revenues could have a material adverse impact on AbbVie's results of operations and cash flows. These events could include loss of patent protection for Humira (as described further in \u201c\u2014\nThe expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect AbbVie\u2019s future revenues and operating earnings\n\u201d above), the commercialization of biosimilars of Humira, the discovery of previously unknown side effects or impaired efficacy, increased competition from the introduction of new, more effective or less expensive treatments and discontinuation or removal from the market of Humira for any reason.\n \nAbbVie's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing and marketing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause its revenues and profitability to decline.\nTo remain competitive, AbbVie must continue to launch new products and new indications and/or brand extensions for existing products, and such launches must generate revenue sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues of profitable products that are lost to or displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenue and profitability. Accordingly, AbbVie commits substantial effort, funds, and other resources to research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. A high rate of failure in the biopharmaceutical industry is inherent in the research and development of new products, and failure can occur at any point in the research and development process, including after significant funds have been invested. Products that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market for numerous reasons, including failure to demonstrate effectiveness, safety concerns, superior safety or efficacy of competing therapies, failure to achieve positive clinical or pre-clinical outcomes beyond the current standards of care, \n2021 Form 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n16\ninability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or delays in the approval of new products and new indications, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others.\nDecisions about research studies made early in the development process of a pharmaceutical product candidate can affect the marketing strategy once such candidate receives approval. More detailed studies may demonstrate additional benefits that can help in the marketing, but they also consume time and resources and may delay submitting the pharmaceutical product candidate for approval. AbbVie cannot guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made with respect to each pharmaceutical product candidate or that decisions in this area would not adversely affect AbbVie's future results of operations.\nEven if AbbVie successfully develops and markets new products or enhancements to its existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing clinical preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors' innovations. AbbVie's innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of existing clinical practices or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. AbbVie cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause AbbVie's products to become obsolete, causing AbbVie's revenues and operating results to suffer.\nA portion of AbbVie's near-term pharmaceutical pipeline relies on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of its products.\nAbbVie depends on alliances and joint ventures with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for a portion of the products in its near-term pharmaceutical pipeline. Failures by these parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations to AbbVie, or any disruption in the relationships between AbbVie and these third parties, could have an adverse effect on AbbVie's pharmaceutical pipeline and business. In addition, AbbVie's collaborative relationships for research and development extend for many years and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of AbbVie and its collaboration partners, including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations. This could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation, administrative proceedings or arbitration.\nBiologics carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a negative impact on future results of operations.\nThe successful discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is a long, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics. For example, access to and supply of necessary biological materials, such as cell lines, may be limited and governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials. In addition, the development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is subject to regulations that are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. Manufacturing biologics, especially in large quantities, is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies. Such manufacturing also requires facilities specifically designed and validated for this purpose and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures. Biologics are also frequently costly to manufacture because production inputs are derived from living animal or plant material, and some biologics cannot be made synthetically. Failure to successfully discover, develop, manufacture and sell biologics\u2014including Humira\u2014could adversely impact AbbVie's business and results of operations.\nAbbVie's biologic products are subject to competition from biosimilars.\nThe Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act creates a framework for the approval of biosimilars in the United States and could allow competitors to reference data from biologic products already approved. In Europe, the European Commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years. In addition, companies are developing biosimilars in other countries that could and do compete with AbbVie\u2019s biologic products, including Humira. As competitors obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing AbbVie\u2019s biologic products, AbbVie\u2019s products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars, with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences. Expiration or successful challenge of AbbVie\u2019s applicable patent rights could also trigger competition from other products, assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired. As a result, AbbVie could face more litigation and administrative proceedings with respect to the validity and/or scope of patents relating to its biologic products.\nNew products and technological advances by AbbVie's competitors may negatively affect AbbVie's results of operations.\nAbbVie competes with other research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that discover, manufacture, market and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products and biologics. For example, Humira competes with anti-TNF products \n17 \n \n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n2021 Form 10-K\nand other competitive products intended to treat a number of disease states and Mavyret/Maviret competes with other available hepatitis C treatment options. In addition, in the past few years, a number of other companies have started to develop, have successfully developed and/or are currently marketing products that are being positioned as competitors to Botox. All of these competitors may introduce new products or develop technological advances that compete with AbbVie\u2019s products in therapeutic areas such as immunology, hematologic oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience, eye care and women's health. AbbVie cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction by competitors of new products or technological advances. Such competing products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than AbbVie\u2019s products, and this could negatively impact AbbVie\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if AbbVie or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing AbbVie's products, AbbVie's business could suffer.\nThe manufacture of many of AbbVie's products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities, including those intended to support future demand for AbbVie's products, changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, changes in the types of products produced, physical limitations that could inhibit continuous supply, man-made or natural disasters and environmental factors. If problems arise during the production of a batch of product, that batch of product may have to be discarded and AbbVie may experience product shortages or incur added expenses. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred.\nAbbVie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers, and an interruption in the supply of those products could adversely affect AbbVie's business and results of operations.\nAbbVie uses a number of products in its pharmaceutical and biologic manufacturing processes that are sourced from single suppliers. The failure of these single-source suppliers to fulfill their contractual obligations in a timely manner or as a result of regulatory noncompliance or physical disruption at a manufacturing site may impair AbbVie's ability to deliver its products to customers on a timely and competitive basis, which could adversely affect AbbVie's business and results of operations. Finding an alternative supplier could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the nature of the products and the need to obtain regulatory approvals. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will be able to reach agreement with alternative providers or that regulatory authorities would approve AbbVie's use of such alternatives. AbbVie does, however, carry business interruption insurance, which provides a degree of protection in the case of a failure by a single-source supplier.\nCertain aspects of AbbVie\u2019s operations are highly dependent upon third party service providers.\nAbbVie relies on suppliers, vendors and other third party service providers to research, develop, manufacture, commercialize, promote and sell its products. Reliance on third party manufacturers reduces AbbVie\u2019s oversight and control of the manufacturing process. Some of these third party providers are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, privacy and security risks and market risks of their own. The failure of a critical third party service provider to meet its obligations could have a material adverse impact on AbbVie\u2019s operations and results. If any third party service providers have violated or are alleged to have violated any laws or regulations during the performance of their obligations to AbbVie, it is possible that AbbVie could suffer financial and reputational harm or other negative outcomes, including possible legal consequences.\nSignificant safety or efficacy issues could arise for AbbVie's products, which could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenues and financial condition.\nPharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. If new safety or efficacy issues are reported or if new scientific information becomes available (including results of post-marketing Phase\u00a04 trials), or if governments change standards regarding safety, efficacy or labeling, AbbVie may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, AbbVie may voluntarily provide or be required to provide updated information on a product's label or narrow its approved indication, either of which could reduce the product's market acceptance. If safety or efficacy issues with an AbbVie product arise, sales of the product could be halted by AbbVie or by regulatory authorities and regulatory action could be \n2021 Form 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n18\ntaken by such regulatory authorities. Safety or efficacy issues affecting suppliers' or competitors' products also may reduce the market acceptance of AbbVie's products.\nNew data about AbbVie's products, or products similar to its products, could negatively impact demand for AbbVie's products due to real or perceived safety issues or uncertainty regarding efficacy and, in some cases, could result in product withdrawal. Furthermore, new data and information, including information about product misuse, may lead government agencies, professional societies, practice management groups or organizations involved with various diseases to publish guidelines or recommendations related to the use of AbbVie's products or the use of related therapies or place restrictions on sales. Such guidelines or recommendations may lead to lower sales of AbbVie's products.\nAbbVie is subject to product liability claims and other lawsuits that may adversely affect its business and results of operations.\nIn the ordinary course of business, AbbVie is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that AbbVie's products or the products of other companies that it promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients. For example, lawsuits are pending against Allergan, AbbVie\u2019s recently acquired subsidiary, and certain of its current and former officers alleging they made misrepresentations and omissions regarding Allergan\u2019s textured breast implants. Product liability claims and lawsuits and safety alerts or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business, results of operations and reputation and on its ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the product in question, lower income and exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured.\nAbbVie is also the subject of other claims, legal proceedings and investigations in the ordinary course of business, which relate to the intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters. Adverse outcomes in such claims, legal proceedings and investigations may also adversely affect AbbVie\u2019s business and results of operations. Additionally, Allergan has been named as a defendant in approximately 3,130 matters relating to the promotion and sale of prescription opioid pain relievers and additional suits may be filed. See Note 15, \"Legal Proceedings and Contingencies\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" AbbVie cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.\nAbbVie is subject to cost-containment efforts and pricing pressures that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings, and changes in the terms of rebate and chargeback programs, which are common in the pharmaceuticals industry, could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations.\nCost-containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in Item 1, \"Business\u2014Regulation\u2014Commercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing.\" To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater demand, increased patient access to health care, or other factors, AbbVie's future revenues and operating earnings will be reduced. In the United States, the European Union and other countries, AbbVie's business has experienced downward pressure on product pricing, and this pressure could increase in the future.\nAbbVie is subject to increasing public and legislative pressure with respect to pharmaceutical pricing. In the United States, practices of managed care groups, and institutional and governmental purchasers, and United States federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, including the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, contribute to pricing pressures. The potential for continuing changes to the health care system in the United States and the increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid and private sector beneficiaries could result in additional pricing pressures.\nIn numerous major markets worldwide, the government plays a significant role in funding health care services and determining the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products. Consequently, in those markets, AbbVie is subject to government decision-making and budgetary actions with respect to its products. In particular, many European countries have ongoing government-mandated price reductions for many pharmaceutical products, and AbbVie anticipates continuing pricing pressures in Europe. Differences between countries in pricing regulations could lead to third-party cross-border trading in AbbVie's products that results in a reduction in future revenues and operating earnings.\nRebates related to government programs, such as fee-for-service Medicaid or Medicaid managed care programs, arise from laws and regulations. AbbVie cannot predict if additional government initiatives to contain health care costs or other factors could lead to new or modified regulatory requirements that include higher or incremental rebates or discounts. Other rebate and discount programs arise from contractual agreements with private payers. Various factors, including market factors and the ability of private payers to control patient access to products, may provide payers the leverage to negotiate higher or additional rebates or discounts that could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's operations.\n19 \n \n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n2021 Form 10-K\nAbbVie is subject to numerous governmental regulations, and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes.\nAbbVie's products are subject to rigorous regulation by numerous international, supranational, federal and state authorities, as described in Item 1, \"Business\u2014Regulation\u2014Discovery and Clinical Development,\u201d \u201cBusiness\u2014Regulation\u2014Commercialization, Distribution and Manufacturing,\u201d and \u201cBusiness\u2014Regulation\u2014Medical Devices.\u201d The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a pharmaceutical product can be costly and time consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain approvals for, future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues and substantial additional costs.\nIn addition, AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will remain compliant with applicable regulatory requirements once approval has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling and advertising and post-marketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns. AbbVie must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations.\nPossible regulatory actions could result in substantial modifications to AbbVie's business practices and operations; refunds, recalls or seizures of AbbVie's products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of AbbVie's or its suppliers' facilities while AbbVie or its supplier remedies the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future approvals; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt AbbVie's business and have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations.\nLaws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on AbbVie, require it to change its business practices, and restrict its operations in the future.\nThe health care industry is subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit programs reimbursement, rebates, price reporting and regulation and health care fraud and abuse. In the United States, these laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws, the Medicaid Rebate Statute, the Veterans Health Care Act, the U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act, the TRICARE program, the government pricing rules applicable to the Medicaid, Medicare Part B, 340B Drug Pricing Program and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to change and evolving interpretations, which could require AbbVie to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt AbbVie's business and result in a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations.\n \nThe international nature of AbbVie's business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline.\nAbbVie's business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including in emerging markets. Net revenues outside of the United States made up approximately 23% of AbbVie's total net revenues in 2021. The risks associated with AbbVie's operations outside the United States include:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in medical reimbursement policies and programs;\n\u2022\nmultiple legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict AbbVie's ability to manufacture, market and sell its products;\n\u2022\ndiffering local product preferences and product requirements;\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\ninternational trade disruptions or disputes;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in establishing, staffing and managing operations;\n\u2022\ndiffering labor regulations;\n\u2022\npotentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;\n2021 Form 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n20\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability, including as a result of the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union and the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nsovereign debt issues;\n\u2022\nprice and currency exchange controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization and other governmental action and regulation;\n\u2022\ninflation, recession and fluctuations in interest rates;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on transfers of funds;\n\u2022\npotential deterioration in the economic position and credit quality of certain non-U.S. countries; and\n\u2022\npotential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery and other similar laws and regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act.\nEvents contemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's revenues and profitability.\nIf AbbVie does not effectively and profitably commercialize its products, AbbVie's revenues and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAbbVie must effectively and profitably commercialize its principal products by creating and meeting continued market demand; achieving market acceptance and generating product sales; ensuring that the active pharmaceutical ingredient(s) for a product and the finished product are manufactured in sufficient quantities and in compliance with requirements of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies and with acceptable quality and pricing to meet commercial demand; and ensuring that the entire supply chain efficiently and consistently delivers AbbVie's products to its customers. The commercialization of AbbVie products may not be successful due to, among other things, unexpected challenges from competitors, new safety issues or concerns being reported that may impact or narrow approved indications, the relative price of AbbVie's product as compared to alternative treatment options and changes to a product's label that further restrict its marketing. If the commercialization of AbbVie's principal products is unsuccessful, AbbVie's ability to generate revenue from product sales will be adversely affected.\nAbbVie may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of assets, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability.\nAbbVie may pursue acquisitions, technology licensing arrangements, joint ventures and strategic alliances, or dispose of some of its assets, as part of its business strategy. AbbVie may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If AbbVie is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. AbbVie may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. AbbVie could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of AbbVie's credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense.\nAdditionally, changes in AbbVie's structure, operations, revenues, costs, or efficiency resulting from major transactions such as acquisitions, divestitures, mergers, alliances, joint ventures, restructurings or other strategic initiatives, may result in greater than expected costs, may take longer than expected to complete or encounter other difficulties, including the need for regulatory approval where appropriate.\nAbbVie is dependent on wholesale distributors for distribution of its products in the United States and, accordingly, its results of operations could be adversely affected if they encounter financial difficulties.\nIn 2021, three wholesale distributors (McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health,\u00a0Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corporation) accounted for substantially all of AbbVie's pharmaceutical product sales in the United States. If one of its significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties, such distributor may decrease the amount of business that it does with AbbVie, and AbbVie may be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes it on a timely basis or at all, which could negatively impact AbbVie's business and results of operations.\n21 \n \n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n2021 Form 10-K\nAbbVie has debt obligations that could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations.\nThe amount of debt that AbbVie has incurred and intends to incur could have important consequences to AbbVie and its investors. These consequences include, among other things, requiring a portion of AbbVie's cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt and reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow AbbVie's business. In particular, AbbVie incurred significant debt in connection with its acquisition of Allergan. AbbVie\u2019s substantially increased indebtedness and higher debt to equity ratio as a result of the acquisition may exacerbate these risks and have the effect of, among other things, reducing its flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and/or lowering its credit ratings. To the extent AbbVie incurs additional indebtedness or interest rates increase, these risks could increase further. In addition, AbbVie's cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and AbbVie may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance its debt. \nAbbVie may need additional financing in the future to meet its capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions, and such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nAbbVie may need to seek additional financing for its general corporate purposes. For example, it may need to increase its investment in research and development activities or need funds to make acquisitions. AbbVie may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to it, if at all. If AbbVie loses its investment grade credit rating or adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, AbbVie may be unable to fund its expansion, successfully develop or enhance products, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could negatively affect AbbVie's business. If AbbVie raises additional funds by issuing debt or entering into credit facilities, it may be subject to limitations on its operations due to restrictive covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect AbbVie's business.\nAbbVie depends on information technology and a failure of those systems could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business.\nAbbVie relies on sophisticated software applications and complex information technology systems to operate its business. These systems are potentially vulnerable to malicious intrusion, random attack, loss of data privacy, disruption, degradation or breakdown. Data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may in the future result in the failure of critical business operations. Such breaches may cause sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to AbbVie, its patients, customers or business partners, to be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. To date, AbbVie\u2019s business or operations have not been materially impacted by such incidents. Although AbbVie has invested in the protection of its data and information technology and also monitors its systems on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent material breakdowns or breaches in AbbVie's information technology systems that could adversely affect AbbVie's business. Such adverse consequences could include loss of revenue, or the loss of critical or sensitive information from AbbVie\u2019s or third-party providers\u2019 databases or IT systems and could also result in legal, financial, reputational or business harm to AbbVie and potentially substantial remediation costs.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Allergan, AbbVie\u2019s balances of intangible assets, including developed product rights and goodwill acquired, have increased significantly. Such balances are subject to impairment testing and may result in impairment charges, which will adversely affect AbbVie\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nA significant amount of AbbVie\u2019s total assets is related to acquired intangibles and goodwill. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of AbbVie\u2019s developed product rights and other intangible assets was $76.0\u00a0billion and the carrying value of AbbVie\u2019s goodwill was $32.4\u00a0billion.\nAbbVie\u2019s developed product rights are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization. AbbVie determines original fair value and amortization periods for developed product rights based on its assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and cash flows of the acquired products. Significant adverse changes to any of these factors require AbbVie to perform an impairment test on the affected asset and, if evidence of impairment exists, require AbbVie to take an impairment charge with respect to the asset. For assets that are not impaired, AbbVie may adjust the remaining useful lives. Such a charge could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nAbbVie\u2019s other significant intangible assets include in-process research and development (IPR&D) intangible projects, acquired in recent business combinations, which are indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nGoodwill and AbbVie\u2019s IPR&D intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, or when events occur or circumstances change that could potentially reduce the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset. Impairment testing compares the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset to its carrying amount. A goodwill or IPR&D impairment, if any, would be recorded in operating income and could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n2021 Form 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n22\nFailure to attract, develop and retain highly qualified personnel could affect AbbVie\u2019s ability to successfully develop and commercialize products.\nAbbVie\u2019s success is largely dependent on its continued ability to attract, develop and retain diverse, highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel, as well as personnel with expertise in clinical research and development (R&D), governmental regulation and commercialization. Competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field is intense. AbbVie cannot be sure that it will be able to attract and retain quality personnel or that the costs of doing so will not materially increase.\nOther factors can have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's profitability and financial condition.\nMany other factors can affect AbbVie's results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, product marketing application standards, data privacy laws, particularly in the European Union and the United States, and environmental laws;\n\u2022\ndifferences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for pension and post-employment benefits, stock-based compensation, intangibles and goodwill; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation and contingent consideration, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum, compared to the actual amount;\n\u2022\nchanges in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, commodities and supplies), interest rates, market value of AbbVie's equity investments and the performance of investments held by it or its employee benefit trusts;\n\u2022\nchanges in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to AbbVie or its employee benefit trusts;\n\u2022\nenvironmental liabilities in connection with AbbVie\u2019s manufacturing processes and distribution logistics, including the handling of hazardous materials;\n\u2022\nchanges in the ability of third parties that provide information technology, accounting, human resources, payroll and other outsourced services to AbbVie to meet their contractual obligations to AbbVie; \n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions stemming from natural disasters, such as climate change, earthquakes, hurricanes, flooding, fires, or efforts taken by third parties to prevent or mitigate such disasters; and\n\u2022\nchanges in business, economic and political conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action; natural disasters; the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups.\nRisks Related to AbbVie's Common Stock\nAbbVie cannot guarantee the timing, amount, or payment of dividends on its common stock.\nAlthough AbbVie expects to pay regular cash dividends, the timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders will fall within the discretion of AbbVie's board of directors. The board's decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant. For more information, see Item 5, \"Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\" AbbVie's ability to pay dividends will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access capital markets. AbbVie cannot guarantee that it will continue to pay a dividend in the future.\nAn AbbVie stockholder's percentage of ownership in AbbVie may be diluted in the future.\nIn the future, a stockholder's percentage ownership in AbbVie may be diluted because of equity issuances for capital market transactions, equity awards that AbbVie will be granting to AbbVie's directors, officers and employees, acquisitions or other purposes. AbbVie's employees have options to purchase shares of its common stock as a result of conversion of their Abbott stock options (in whole or in part) to AbbVie stock options. AbbVie anticipates its compensation committee will grant additional stock options or other stock-based awards to its employees. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on AbbVie's earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of AbbVie's common stock. From time to time, AbbVie will issue additional options or other stock-based awards to its employees under AbbVie's employee benefits plans.\n23 \n \n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n2021 Form 10-K\nIn addition, AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes AbbVie to issue, without the approval of AbbVie's stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over AbbVie's common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as AbbVie's board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of AbbVie's common stock. For example, AbbVie could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of AbbVie's directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences AbbVie could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nCertain provisions in AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of AbbVie, which could decrease the trading price of AbbVie's common stock.\nAbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by encouraging prospective acquirors to negotiate with AbbVie's board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe inability of AbbVie's stockholders to call a special meeting;\n\u2022\nthe division of AbbVie's board of directors into three classes of directors, with each class serving a staggered three-year term;\n\u2022\na provision that stockholders may only remove directors for cause;\n\u2022\nthe ability of AbbVie's directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on AbbVie's board of directors; and\n\u2022\nthe requirement that the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least 80%\u00a0of AbbVie's voting stock is required to amend certain provisions in AbbVie's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and AbbVie's amended and restated by-laws relating to the number, term and election of AbbVie's directors, the filling of board vacancies, the calling of special meetings of stockholders and director and officer indemnification provisions.\nIn addition, Section\u00a0203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15%\u00a0of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation's outstanding voting stock.\nAbbVie believes these provisions protect its stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with AbbVie's board of directors and by providing AbbVie's board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make the company immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that AbbVie's board of directors determines is not in the best interests of AbbVie and AbbVie's stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.\n2021 Form 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n24\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form\u00a010-K contains certain forward looking statements regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial performance and other matters.

(AbbVie or the company). This commentary should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes appearing in Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nCompany Overview\nAbbVie is a global, diversified research-based biopharmaceutical company positioned for success with a comprehensive product portfolio that has leadership positions across immunology, hematologic oncology, neuroscience, aesthetics and eye care. AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world\u2019s most complex and serious diseases.\nAbbVie's products are generally sold worldwide directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, health care facilities, specialty pharmacies and independent retailers from AbbVie-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Certain products (including aesthetic products and devices) are also sold directly to physicians and other licensed healthcare providers. In the United States, AbbVie distributes pharmaceutical products principally through independent wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to retailers, pharmacies, patients or other customers. Outside the United States, AbbVie sells products primarily to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with other companies. AbbVie has approximately 50,000 employees. AbbVie operates as a single global business segment. \n2021 Financial Results\nAbbVie's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, maximizing the benefits of the Allergan acquisition, advancing and investing in its pipeline and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. The company's financial performance in 2021 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $56.2\u00a0billion, operating earnings of $17.9\u00a0billion, diluted earnings per share of $6.45 and cash flows from operations of $22.8\u00a0billion. Worldwide net revenues increased by 23% on a reported basis and 22% on a constant currency basis, reflecting growth across its immunology, hematologic oncology, neuroscience, aesthetics and eye care portfolios as well as a full period of Allergan results in 2021 compared to the prior year.\nDiluted earnings per share in 2021 was $6.45 and included the following after-tax costs: (i) $6.4\u00a0billion related to the amortization of intangible assets; (ii) $2.7 billion for the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities;                 (iii) $948\u00a0million for acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D); (iv) $500\u00a0million as a result of a collaboration agreement extension with Calico Life Sciences LLC; (v) $307\u00a0million for milestones and other research and development (R&D) expenses; (vi) $253 million for charges related to litigation matters; and (vii) $215\u00a0million of acquisition and integration expenses. These costs were partially offset by $265 million of certain tax benefits. Additionally, financial results reflected continued funding to support all stages of AbbVie\u2019s pipeline assets and continued investment in AbbVie\u2019s on-market brands.\nIn October 2021, AbbVie's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.41 per share of common stock payable in February 2022. This reflects an increase of approximately 8.5% over the previous quarterly dividend of $1.30 per share of common stock.\nFollowing the closing of the Allergan acquisition, AbbVie implemented an integration plan designed to reduce costs, integrate and optimize the combined organization. The integration plan is expected to realize\n approximately $2.5 billion of annual cost synergies in 2022\n.\n2021 Form 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n32\nTo achieve these integration objectives, AbbVie expects to incur total cumulative charges of approximately $2 billion through 2022. These costs consist of severance and employee benefit costs (cash severance, non-cash severance, including accelerated equity award compensation expense, retention and other termination benefits) and other integration expenses.\nImpact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nIn response to the ongoing public health crisis posed by COVID-19, AbbVie continues to focus on ensuring the safety of employees. Throughout the pandemic, AbbVie has followed health and safety guidance from state and local health authorities and implemented safety measures for those employees who are returning to the workplace. \nAbbVie also continues to closely manage manufacturing and supply chain resources around the world to help ensure that patients continue to receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines. Clinical trial sites are being monitored locally to protect the safety of study participants, staff and employees. While the impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie's operations to date has not been material, AbbVie continues to experience lower new patient starts in certain products and markets. AbbVie expects this matter could continue to negatively impact its results of operations throughout the duration of the pandemic. \nThe extent to which COVID-19 may impact AbbVie's financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain and is dependent on numerous evolving factors, including the measures being taken by authorities to mitigate against the spread of COVID-19, the emergence of new variants and the availability and successful administration of effective vaccines.\n2022 Strategic Objectives\nAbbVie's mission is to discover and develop innovative medicines and products that solve serious health issues today and address the medical challenges of tomorrow while achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution. AbbVie intends to continue to advance its mission in a number of ways, including: (i) maximizing the benefits of a diversified revenue base with multiple long-term growth drivers; (ii)\u00a0growing revenues by leveraging AbbVie's commercial strength and international infrastructure across therapeutic areas and ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches; (iii)\u00a0continuing to invest in and expand its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care as well as continued investment in key on-market products; (iv)\u00a0expanding operating margins; and (v)\u00a0returning cash to shareholders via a strong and growing dividend while also reducing debt. In addition, AbbVie anticipates several regulatory submissions and data readouts from key clinical trials in the next 12 months.\nAbbVie expects to achieve its strategic objectives through:\n\u2022\nImmunology revenue growth driven by increasing market share and indication expansion of Skyrizi and Rinvoq, as well as Humira U.S. sales growth. \n\u2022\nHematologic oncology revenue growth driven by increasing market share and indication expansion of Venclexta, as well as maintaining the strong leadership position of Imbruvica. \n\u2022\nAesthetics revenue growth driven by global expansion and increasing market penetration of Botox and Juvederm Collection.\n\u2022\nNeuroscience revenue growth driven by Vraylar, Botox Therapeutic, Ubrelvy and recently launched Qulipta.\n\u2022\nSustaining eye care leadership by maximizing AbbVie's current eye care portfolio. \n\u2022\nThe favorable impact of pipeline products and indications recently approved or currently under regulatory review where approval is expected in 2022. These products are described in greater detail in the section labeled \"Research and Development\" included as part of this Item 7.\nAbbVie remains committed to driving continued expansion of operating margins and expects to achieve this objective through continued realization of expense synergies from the Allergan acquisition, leverage from revenue growth, productivity initiatives in supply chain and ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs and general corporate expenses.\n33 \n \n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n2021 Form 10-K\nResearch and Development\nResearch and innovation are the cornerstones of AbbVie's business as a global biopharmaceutical company. AbbVie's long-term success depends to a great extent on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies.\nAbbVie's pipeline currently includes approximately 90 compounds, devices or indications in development individually or under collaboration or license agreements and is focused on such important specialties as immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care. Of these programs, more than 50 are in mid- and late-stage development.\nThe following sections summarize transitions of significant programs from mid-stage development to late-stage development as well as developments in significant late-stage and registration programs. AbbVie expects multiple mid-stage programs to transition into late-stage programs in the next 12 months.\nSignificant Programs and Developments\nImmunology\nSkyrizi\n\u2022\nIn January 2021, AbbVie announced top-line results from its Phase 3 KEEPsAKE-1 and KEEPsAKE-2 clinical trials of Skyrizi in adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) met the primary and ranked secondary endpoints.\n\u2022\nIn January 2021, AbbVie announced top-line results from its Phase 3 ADVANCE and MOTIVATE induction studies of Skyrizi in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease met the primary and key secondary endpoints.\n\u2022\nIn April 2021, AbbVie received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Skyrizi in a single dose pre-filled syringe and pre-filled pen. This approval will reduce the number of injections administered per treatment.\n\u2022\nIn June 2021, AbbVie announced top-line results from its Phase 3 FORTIFY study for Skyrizi in patients with moderate to severe Crohn\u2019s disease met the co-primary endpoints. \n\u2022\nIn September 2021, AbbVie submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA for Skyrizi for the treatment of patients 16 years and older with moderate to severe Crohn\u2019s disease.\n\u2022\nIn November 2021, \nAbbVie submitted a marketing authorization application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Skyrizi for the treatment of patients 16 years or older with moderate to severe active Crohn's disease who have had inadequate response, lost response or were intolerant to conventional or biologic therapy.\n\u2022\nIn November 2021, Ab\nbVie announced that the European Commission (EC) approved Skyrizi alone or in combination with methotrexate for the treatment of active PsA in adults who have had an inadequate response or who have been intolerant to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.\n\u2022\nIn January 2022, A\nbbVie announced that the FDA approved Skyrizi for the treatment of adults with active PsA. \nRinvoq\n\u2022\nIn January 2021, AbbVie announced that the EC approved Rinvoq for the treatment of adults with active PsA and ankylosing spondylitis (AS).\n\u2022\nIn February 2021, AbbVie announced its Phase 3 U-ACCOMPLISH induction study of Rinvoq for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) met the primary and all ranked secondary endpoints.\n\u2022\nIn June 2021, AbbVie announced the FDA will not meet the Prescription Drug User Fee Act action dates for the sNDA of Rinvoq for the treatment of adults with active AS. No formal regulatory action has been taken on the sNDA for Rinvoq in AS.\n\u2022\nIn June 2021, AbbVie announced the results from its Phase 3 maintenance study of Rinvoq in patients with UC met the primary and all secondary endpoints.\n\u2022\nIn August 2021, AbbVie announced that the EC approved Rinvoq for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD) in adults and adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.\n2021 Form 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n34\n\u2022\nIn September 2021, AbbVie submitted an sNDA to the FDA and an MAA to the EMA for Rinvoq for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active UC.\n\u2022\nIn October 2021, A\nbbVie announced the results from Study 1 of the Phase 3 SELECT-AXIS 2 clinical trial for Rinvoq in patients with active AS and inadequate response to biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs met the primary and all ranked secondary endpoints.\n\u2022\nIn October 2021, A\nbbVie announced the results from Study 2 of the Phase 3 SELECT-AXIS 2 clinical trial for Rinvoq in adults with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis met the primary and 12 of 14 ranked secondary endpoints.\n\u2022\nIn December 2021, \nAbbVie announced top-line results from its Phase 3 U-EXCEED induction study for Rinvoq in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease who had an inadequate response or were intolerant to biologic therapy met the primary and key secondary endpoints.\n\u2022\nIn December 2021, \nAbbVie announced an update to the U.S. Prescribing Information and Medication Guide for Rinvoq for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This update follows a Drug Safety Communication (DSC) issued by the FDA in September 2021 based on its final review of the post-marketing study evaluating another JAK inhibitor (tofacitinib) in patients with RA. The DSC and this label update apply to the class of systematically administered FDA-approved JAK inhibitors for the treatment of RA and other inflammatory diseases. Based on this class-wide update, the U.S. label for Rinvoq will now include additional information about risks within the Boxed Warnings and Warnings Precautions sections. The indication has also been updated to be indicated for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers.\n\u2022\nIn December 2021, A\nbbVie announced that the FDA approved Rinvoq for the treatment of adults with active PsA who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNF blockers.\n\u2022\nIn January 2022, Abb\nVie announced its submission of an sNDA to the FDA and an MAA to the EMA for Rinvoq for the treatment of adults with active nr-axSpA with objective signs of inflammation who have responded inadequately to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\n\u2022\nIn January 2022, Ab\nbVie announced that the FDA approved Rinvoq for the treatment of moderate to severe AD in adults and children 12 years of age and older whose disease did not respond to previous treatment and is not well controlled with other pills or injections, including biologic medicines, or when use of other pills or injections is not recommended.\n\u2022\nIn February 2022, \nAbbVie was notified that the EC is requesting the EMA to assess safety concerns associated with JAK inhibitor products authorized in inflammatory diseases and to evaluate the impact of these events on their benefit-risk balance. The assessment covers all JAK inhibitors approved for use in inflammatory diseases. The request is for an opinion from the EMA by September 30, 2022.\nOncology\nImbruvica\n\u2022\nIn June 2021, AbbVie announced results from its Phase 3 GLOW study comparing the efficacy and safety of Imbruvica in combination with Venclexta versus chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab for first-line treatment in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma met its primary endpoint.\nVenclexta\n\u2022\nIn May 2021, AbbVie received European Commission approval for Venclyxto in combination with a hypomethylating agent for patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.\n35 \n \n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n2021 Form 10-K\n\u2022\nIn July 2021, AbbVie announced that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to Venclexta in combination with azacitidine for the potential treatment of adult patients with previously untreated intermediate-, high- and very high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes.\nTeliso-V\n\u2022\nIn January 2022,\n AbbVie announced that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to investigational telisotuzumab vedotin (Teliso-V) for the treatment of patients with advanced/metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor wild type, nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer with high levels of c-Met overexpression whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-based therapy.\nNeuroscience\nBotox Therapeutic\n\u2022\nIn February 2021, AbbVie received FDA approval of Botox for the treatment of detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition in certain pediatric patients 5 years of age and older.\nQulipta\n\u2022\nIn September 2021, AbbVie announced that the FDA approved Qulipta (atogepant) for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults.\nVraylar\n\u2022\nIn October 2021, A\nbbVie announced top-line results from two Phase 3 clinical trials, Study 3111-301-001 and Study 3111-302-001, evaluating the efficacy and safety of cariprazine (Vraylar) as an adjunctive treatment for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). In Study 3111-301-001, Vraylar met its primary endpoint demonstrating statistically significant change from baseline to week six in the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score compared with placebo in patients with MDD. In Study 3111-302-001, Vraylar demonstrated numerical improvement in depressive symptoms from baseline to week six in MADRS total score compared with placebo but did not achieve statistical significance. Safety data were consistent with the established safety profile of Vraylar across indications with no new safety signals identified.\nABBV-951\n\u2022\nIn October 2021, Abb\nVie announced that results from its pivotal Phase 3 M15-736 study of ABBV-951 (foslevodopa/foscarbidopa) in patients with advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease met its primary endpoint in a 12-week study.\nEye Care\nVuity\n\u2022\nIn October 2021,\n AbbVie announced that the FDA approved Vuity (pilocarpine HCl ophthalmic solution) for the treatment of presbyopia.\n2021 Form 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n36\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Revenues\nThe comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency net revenues at the prior year's foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in net revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and current periods. AbbVie believes that the non-GAAP measure of change in net revenues at constant currency rates, when used in conjunction with the GAAP measure of change in net revenues at actual currency rates, may provide a more complete understanding of the company's operations and can facilitate analysis of the company's results of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another.\nPercent change\nAt actual currency rates\nAt constant currency rates\nyears ended (dollars in millions)\n2021\n2020\n2019\n2021\n2020\n2021\n2020\nUnited

after the acquisition closing date of May 8, 2020.\nThe following discussion and analysis of AbbVie's net revenues by product is presented on a constant currency basis.\nGlobal Humira sales increased 4% in 2021 primarily driven by market growth across therapeutic categories, partially offset by direct biosimilar competition in certain international markets. In the United States, Humira sales increased 8% in 2021 driven by market growth across all indications. This increase was partially offset by slightly lower market share following corresponding market share gains of Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Internationally, Humira revenues decreased 13% in 2021 primarily driven by direct biosimilar competition in certain international markets. \nNet revenues for Skyrizi increased 84% in 2021 primarily driven by continued strong volume and market share uptake since launch in 2019 as a treatment for plaque psoriasis as well as market growth over the prior year.\nNet revenues for Rinvoq increased by more than 100% in 2021 primarily driven by continued strong volume and market share uptake since launch in 2019 for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis as well as market growth over the prior year. Net revenues were also favorably impacted by recent regulatory approvals and expansion of Rinvoq for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis and ankylosing spondylitis in certain international markets.\n39 \n \n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n2021 Form 10-K\nNet revenues for Imbruvica represent product revenues in the United States and collaboration revenues outside of the United States related to AbbVie's 50% share of Imbruvica profit. AbbVie's global Imbruvica revenues increased 2% in 2021 as a result of modest favorable pricing in the United States and increased collaboration revenues, partially offset by lower new patient starts due to the COVID-19 pandemic and share loss in the United States.\nNet revenues for Venclexta increased 34% in 2021 primarily due to continued expansion of Venclexta for the treatment of patients with first-line CLL, relapsed/refractory CLL and first-line AML.\nNet revenues for Botox Cosmetic used in facial aesthetics increased 98% in 2021 due to increased brand investment and strong recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Net revenues were also favorably impacted by a full period of Allergan results in 2021 compared to the prior year.\nNet revenues for Juvederm Collection (including Juvederm Ultra XC, Juvederm Voluma XC and other Juvederm products) used in facial aesthetics increased by more than 100% in 2021 due to increased brand investment and strong recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Net revenues were also favorably impacted by a full period of Allergan results in 2021 compared to the prior year.\nNet revenues for Botox Therapeutic used primarily in neuroscience and urology therapeutic areas increased 75% in 2021 due to a strong recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Net revenues were also favorably impacted by a full period of Allergan results in 2021 compared to the prior year.\nNet revenues for Vraylar for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder and bipolar depression increased 82% in 2021 due to higher market share and market growth. Net revenues were also favorably impacted by a full period of Allergan results in 2021 compared to the prior year.\nNet revenues for Ubrelvy for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults increased by more than 100% in 2021 primarily due to increased volume and market share uptake since launch in 2020.\nNet revenues for Mavyret decreased 8% in 2021 primarily driven by the continued disruption of global HCV markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGross Margin\nPercent change\nyears ended December 31 (dollars in millions)\n2021\n2020\n2019\n2021\n2020\nGross margin\n$\n38,751\u00a0\n$\n30,417\u00a0\n$\n25,827\u00a0\n27\u00a0\n%\n18\u00a0\n%\nas a percent of net revenues\n69\u00a0\n%\n66\u00a0\n%\n78\u00a0\n%\nGross margin as a percentage of net revenues in 2021 increased from 2020 primarily due to lower amortization of inventory fair value step-up adjustment associated with the Allergan acquisition and favorable changes in product mix, partially offset by higher amortization of intangible assets associated with the Allergan acquisition.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nPercent change\nyears ended December\u00a031 (dollars in millions)\n2021\n2020\n2019\n2021\n2020\nSelling, general and administrative\n$\n12,349\u00a0\n$\n11,299\u00a0\n$\n6,942\u00a0\n9\u00a0\n%\n63\u00a0\n%\nas a percent of net revenues\n22\u00a0\n%\n25\u00a0\n%\n21\u00a0\n%\nSG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues in 2021 decreased primarily due to lower transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of Allergan as well as leverage from revenue growth and synergies realized in the period subsequent to completion of the Allergan acquisition.\n2021 Form 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n40\nResearch and Development and Acquired In-Process Research and Development\nPercent change\nyears ended December\u00a031 (dollars in millions)\n2021\n2020\n2019\n2021\n2020\nResearch and development\n$\n7,084\u00a0\n$\n6,557\u00a0\n$\n6,407\u00a0\n8\u00a0\n%\n2\u00a0\n%\nas a percent of net revenues\n13\u00a0\n%\n14\u00a0\n%\n19\u00a0\n%\nAcquired in-process research and development\n$\n962\u00a0\n$\n1,198\u00a0\n$\n385\u00a0\n(20)\n%\n>100%\nR&D expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased in 2021 primarily due to the increased scale of the combined company and synergies realized for the period subsequent to completion of the Allergan acquisition as well as lower integration costs related to the acquisition of Allergan.\nAcquired IPR&D expenses represent initial costs to acquire rights to in-process R&D projects through R&D collaborations, licensing arrangements or other asset acquisitions. Acquired IPR&D expense in 2021 included a charge of $400 million as a result of exercising the company's exclusive right to acquire TeneoOne, an affiliate of Teneobio, Inc., and TNB-383B, a BCMA-targeting immunotherapeutic for the potential treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and a charge of $370\u00a0million as a result of entering into a collaboration agreement with REGENXBIO Inc. for the development and commercialization of RGX-314, an investigational gene therapy for wet age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy and other chronic retinal diseases. Acquired IPR&D expense in 2020 included a charge of $750 million as a result of entering into a collaboration agreement with Genmab A/S to research, develop and commercialize investigational bispecific antibody therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. Acquired IPR&D expense in 2020 also included a charge of $200 million as a result of entering into a collaboration agreement with I-Mab Biopharma for the development and commercialization of lemzoparlimab for the treatment of multiple cancers. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \nOther Operating Expense (Income), Net\nOther operating expense in 2021 included a $500\u00a0million charge related to the extension of the Calico collaboration to discover, develop and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer.\nOther Non-Operating Expenses\nyears ended December 31 (in\u00a0millions)\n2021\n2020\n2019\nInterest expense\n$\n2,423\u00a0\n$\n2,454\u00a0\n$\n1,784\u00a0\nInterest income\n(39)\n(174)\n(275)\nInterest expense, net\n$\n2,384\u00a0\n$\n2,280\u00a0\n$\n1,509\u00a0\nNet foreign exchange loss\n$\n51\u00a0\n$\n71\u00a0\n$\n42\u00a0\nOther expense, net\n2,500\u00a0\n5,614\u00a0\n3,006\u00a0\nInterest expense in 2021 decreased compared to 2020 primarily due to the favorable impact of lower interest rates on the company\u2019s floating rate debt obligations and deleveraging, partially offset by a higher average debt balance associated with the incremental Allergan debt acquired.\nInterest income in 2021 decreased compared to 2020 primarily due to a lower average cash and cash equivalents balance as a result of the cash paid for the Allergan acquisition and the unfavorable impact of lower interest rates.\nOther expense, net included charges related to changes in fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities of $2.7\u00a0billion in 2021 and $5.8 billion in 2020. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is impacted by the passage of time and multiple other inputs, including the probability of success of achieving regulatory/commercial milestones, discount rates, the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products and other market-based factors. In 2021, the change in fair value included the increase in the Skyrizi contingent consideration liability due to higher estimated sales driven by stronger market share uptake, favorable clinical trial results and the passage of time, partially offset by higher discount rates. In 2020, the change in fair value primarily included the increase in the Skyrizi contingent consideration liability due to higher estimated sales driven by stronger market share uptake, lower discount rates, the passage of time and favorable clinical trial results.\n41 \n \n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n2021 Form 10-K\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe effective income tax rate was 11% in 2021, negative 36% in 2020 and 6% in 2019. The effective income tax rates differed from the statutory tax rate principally due to the impact of foreign operations which reflects the impact of lower income tax rates in locations outside the United States, tax incentives in Puerto Rico and other foreign tax jurisdictions, business development activities, changes in enacted tax rates and laws and related restructuring, tax audit settlements and accretion on contingent consideration. The 2020 effective income tax rate included the recognition of a net tax benefit of $1.7 billion related to changes in tax laws and related restructuring, including certain intra-group transfers of intellectual property and deferred tax remeasurement. The effective tax rates for these periods also reflected the benefit from U.S. tax credits principally related to research and development credits, the orphan drug tax credit and Puerto Rico excise tax credits. The Puerto Rico excise tax credits relate to legislation enacted by Puerto Rico that assesses an excise tax on certain products manufactured in Puerto Rico. The tax is levied on gross inventory purchases from entities in Puerto Rico and is included in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings. The majority of the tax is creditable for U.S. income tax purposes.\nFINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nyears ended December\u00a031 (in millions)\n2021\n2020\n2019\nCash flows provided by (used in)\nOperating activities\n$\n22,777\u00a0\n$\n17,588\u00a0\n$\n13,324\u00a0\nInvesting activities\n(2,344)\n(37,557)\n596\u00a0\nFinancing activities\n(19,039)\n(11,501)\n18,708\u00a0\nOperating cash flows in 2021 increased from 2020. Operating cash flows in 2021 were favorably impacted by higher net revenues of the combined company and lower acquisition-related cash expenses, partially offset by higher income tax payments and the timing of working capital cash flows. Operating cash flows also reflected AbbVie\u2019s contributions to its defined benefit plans of $376\u00a0million in 2021 and $367\u00a0million in 2020.\nInvesting cash flows in 2021 included $535 million cash consideration paid to acquire Soliton, Inc. offset by cash acquired, payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $1.4 billion, capital expenditures of $787\u00a0million and net purchases of investment securities totaling $21 million. Investing cash flows in 2020 included $39.7 billion cash consideration paid to acquire Allergan offset by cash acquired of $1.5 billion, net sales and maturities of investment securities totaling $1.5\u00a0billion, payments made for other acquisitions and investments of $1.4\u00a0billion and capital expenditures of $798\u00a0million.\nFinancing cash flows in 2021 included early repayments of $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of the company's 2.3% principal notes, $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of the company's 5.0% senior notes and \u20ac750 million aggregate principal amount of the company's 0.5% senior Euro notes. Financing cash flows also included the May 2021 repayment of $750 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes and the November 2021 repayment of $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.375% senior notes, $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.15% senior notes and $750 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes at maturity. Additionally, financing cash flows included repayment of a $1.0 billion floating rate term loan due May 2023 and issuance of a new $1.0 billion floating rate term loan as part of the term loan refinancing in September 2021. \nFinancing cash flows in 2020 included the issuance of term loans totaling $3.0\u00a0billion under the existing $6.0\u00a0billion term loan credit agreement which were used to finance the acquisition of Allergan. Subsequent to these borrowings, AbbVie terminated the unused commitments of the lenders under the term loan. Additionally, financing cash flows included the May 2020 repayment of $3.8\u00a0billion aggregate principal amount of the company's 2.50% senior notes, the September 2020 repayment of $650\u00a0million aggregate principal amount of 3.375% senior notes and the November 2020 repayments of \u20ac700 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior Euro notes at maturity as well as the $450 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due February 2021. \nFinancing cash flows also included cash dividend payments of $9.3 billion in 2021 and $7.7 billion in 2020. The increase in cash dividend payments was primarily driven by an increase of the dividend rate and higher outstanding shares following the 286 million shares of AbbVie common stock issued to Allergan shareholders in May 2020.\nThe company's stock repurchase authorization permits purchases of AbbVie shares from time to time in open-market or private transactions at management\u2019s discretion. The program has no time limit and can be discontinued at any time. Under this authorization, AbbVie repurchased 6 million shares for $670\u00a0million in 2021 and 8 million shares for $757\u00a0million in 2020. AbbVie's remaining stock repurchase authorization was $2.5\u00a0billion as of December\u00a031, 2021.\n2021 Form 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n42\n No commercial paper borrowings were issued during 2021. In 2020, the company issued and redeemed commercial paper. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December\u00a031, 2021 or December\u00a031, 2020. AbbVie may issue additional commercial paper or retire commercial paper to meet liquidity requirements as needed.\nCredit Risk\nAbbVie monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers and government regulations and funding, both domestically and abroad. AbbVie regularly communicates with its customers regarding the status of receivable balances, including their payment plans and obtains positive confirmation of the validity of the receivables. AbbVie establishes an allowance for credit losses equal to the estimate of future losses over the contractual life of outstanding accounts receivable. AbbVie may also utilize factoring arrangements to mitigate credit risk, although the receivables included in such arrangements have historically not been a significant amount of total outstanding receivables.\nCredit Facility, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings\nCredit Facility\nAbbVie currently has a $4.0\u00a0billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in August 2024. This amended facility enables the company to borrow funds on an unsecured basis at variable interest rates and contains various covenants. At December\u00a031, 2021, the company was in compliance with all covenants, and commitment fees under the credit facility were insignificant. No amounts were outstanding under the company's credit facility as of December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020.\nAccess to Capital\nThe company intends to fund short-term and long-term financial obligations as they mature through cash on hand, future cash flows from operations or has the ability to issue additional debt. The company's ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company's products or in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, deterioration in the company's key financial ratios or credit ratings, or other material unfavorable changes in business conditions. At the current time, the company believes it has sufficient financial flexibility to issue debt, enter into other financing arrangements and attract long-term capital on acceptable terms to support the company's growth objectives.\nCredit Ratings\nThere were no changes to the company's credit ratings during 2021. Following the acquisition of Allergan in 2020, S&P Global Ratings revised its ratings outlook to stable from negative and lowered the issuer credit rating by one notch to BBB+ from A- and the short-term rating to A-2 from A-1. There were no changes in Moody's Investor Service of its Baa2 senior unsecured long-term rating and Prime-2 short-term rating with a stable outlook.\nUnfavorable changes to the ratings may have an adverse impact on future financing arrangements; however, they would not affect the company\u2019s ability to draw on its credit facility and would not result in an acceleration of scheduled maturities of any of the company\u2019s outstanding debt.\nFuture Cash Requirements\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes AbbVie's estimated material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021:\n(in millions)\nTotal\nCurrent\nLong-term\nLong-term debt, including current portion\n$\n75,962\u00a0\n$\n12,428\u00a0\n$\n63,534\u00a0\nInterest on long-term debt\n(a)\n30,002\u00a0\n2,392\u00a0\n27,610\u00a0\nContingent consideration liabilities\n(b)\n14,887\u00a0\n1,249\u00a0\n13,638\u00a0\n(a)\nIncludes estimated future interest payments on long-term debt. Interest payments on debt are calculated for future periods using forecasted interest rates in effect at the end of 2021. Projected interest payments include the related effects of interest rate swap agreements. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in floating interest rates or other factors or events. The projected interest payments only pertain to obligations and agreements outstanding at December 31, 2021. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's debt instruments and Note 11 for additional information on the interest rate swap agreements outstanding at December 31, 2021.\n43 \n \n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n2021 Form 10-K\n(b)\nIncludes contingent consideration liabilities which are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Potential contingent consideration payments that exceed the fair value recorded on the consolidated balance sheet are not included in the table of contractual obligations. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these liabilities. \nAbbVie enters into certain unconditional purchase obligations and other commitments in the normal course of business. There have been no changes to these commitments that would have a material impact on the company\u2019s ability to meet either short-term or long-term future cash requirements.\nIncome Taxes\nFuture income tax cash requirements include a one-time transition tax liability on a mandatory deemed repatriation of previously untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries resulting from U.S. tax reform enacted in 2017. The one-time transition tax liability was $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2021 and is payable in five future annual installments. \nLiabilities for unrecognized tax benefits totaled $6.0\u00a0billion as of December 31, 2021. It is not possible to reliably estimate the timing of the future cash outflows related to these liabilities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these unrecognized tax benefits.\nQuarterly Cash Dividend\nOn October\u00a029, 2021, AbbVie announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $1.30 per share to $1.41 per share beginning with the dividend payable on February\u00a015, 2022 to stockholders of record as of January\u00a014, 2022. This reflects an increase of approximately 8.5% over the previous quarterly rate. The timing, declaration, amount of and payment of any dividends by AbbVie in the future is within the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including AbbVie's financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of its operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of AbbVie's debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by its board of directors.\nCollaborations, Licensing and Other Arrangements\nAbbVie enters into collaborative, licensing, and other arrangements with third parties that may require future milestone payments to third parties contingent upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, or commercial milestones. Individually, these arrangements are insignificant in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in that period. From a business perspective, the payments are viewed as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate future cash flows from product sales. It is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these collaboration arrangements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. A summary of the company's significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies are considered critical as these most significantly impact the company's financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may vary from these estimates.\nRevenue Recognition \nAbbVie recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the company\u2019s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration AbbVie expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value add and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. AbbVie generates revenue primarily from product sales. For the majority of sales, the company transfers control, invoices the customer and recognizes revenue upon shipment to the customer. \n2021 Form 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n44\nRebates \nAbbVie provides rebates to pharmacy benefit managers, state government Medicaid programs, insurance companies that administer Medicare drug plans, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other government agencies and private entities.\nRebate and chargeback accruals are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the period the related product is sold. Provisions for rebates and chargebacks totaled $33.9 billion in 2021, $27.0 billion in 2020 and $18.8\u00a0billion in 2019. Rebate amounts are typically based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices, which may vary by product and by payer. For each type of rebate, the factors used in the calculations of the accrual for that rebate include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant.\nIn order to establish its rebate and chargeback accruals, the company uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time for each type of rebate. To estimate the rebate percentage or net price, the company tracks sales by product and by customer or payer. The company evaluates inventory data reported by wholesalers, available prescription volume information, product pricing, historical experience and other factors in order to determine the adequacy of its reserves. AbbVie regularly monitors its reserves and records adjustments when rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events indicate that a change in the reserve is appropriate. Historically, adjustments to rebate accruals have not been material to net earnings.\nThe following table is an analysis of the three largest accruals for rebates and chargebacks, which comprise approximately 95% of the total consolidated rebate and chargebacks recorded as reductions to revenues in 2021. Remaining rebate provisions charged against gross revenues are not significant in the determination of operating earnings.\n(in millions)\nMedicaid\n\u00a0and\n\u00a0Medicare\n\u00a0Rebates\nManaged\n\u00a0Care\n\u00a0Rebates\nWholesaler\nChargebacks\nBalance at December\u00a031, 2018\n$\n1,645\u00a0\n$\n1,439\u00a0\n$\n656\u00a0\nProvisions\n4,035\u00a0\n5,772\u00a0\n7,947\u00a0\nPayments\n(3,915)\n(5,275)\n(7,917)\nBalance at December\u00a031, 2019\n1,765\u00a0\n1,936\u00a0\n686\u00a0\nAdditions\n(a)\n1,266\u00a0\n649\u00a0\n71\u00a0\nProvisions\n6,715\u00a0\n8,656\u00a0\n8,677\u00a0\nPayments\n(6,801)\n(8,334)\n(8,693)\nBalance at December\u00a031, 2020\n2,945\u00a0\n2,907\u00a0\n741\u00a0\nProvisions\n9,622\u00a0\n11,306\u00a0\n11,286\u00a0\nPayments\n(8,751)\n(11,116)\n(11,125)\nBalance at December\u00a031, 2021\n$\n3,816\u00a0\n$\n3,097\u00a0\n$\n902\u00a0\n(a)\nRepresents rebate accruals and chargeback allowances assumed in the Allergan acquisition.\nCash Discounts and Product Returns\nCash discounts and product returns, which totaled $3.6\u00a0billion in 2021, $2.4 billion in 2020 and $1.6 billion in 2019, are accounted for as variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related product is sold. The reserve for cash discounts is readily determinable because the company's experience of payment history is fairly consistent. Product returns can be reliably estimated based on the company's historical return experience.\nPension and Other Post-Employment Benefits\nAbbVie engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under the pension and other post-employment benefit plans that are direct obligations of AbbVie. The valuation of the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost for these plans are calculated using actuarial assumptions. The significant assumptions, which are reviewed annually, include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates, and are disclosed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n45 \n \n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n2021 Form 10-K\nThe discount rate is selected based on current market rates on high-quality, fixed-income investments at December\u00a031 each year. AbbVie employs a yield-curve approach for countries where a robust bond market exists. The yield curve is developed using high-quality bonds. The yield-curve approach reflects the plans' specific cash flows (i.e.\u00a0duration) in calculating the benefit obligations by applying the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve. AbbVie reflects the plans' specific cash flows and applies them to the corresponding individual spot rates along the yield curve in calculating the service cost and interest cost portions of expense. For other countries, AbbVie reviews various indices such as corporate bond and government bond benchmarks to estimate the discount rate. \nAbbVie's assumed discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension and other post-employment plans as of December\u00a031, 2021. A 50 basis point change in the assumed discount rate would have had the following effects on AbbVie's calculation of net periodic benefit costs in 2022 and projected benefit obligations as of December\u00a031, 2021:\n50 basis point\n(in millions) (brackets denote a reduction)\nIncrease\nDecrease\nDefined benefit plans\nService and interest cost\n$\n(90)\n$\n100\u00a0\nProjected benefit obligation\n(1,014)\n1,159\u00a0\nOther post-employment plans\nService and interest cost\n$\n(7)\n$\n7\u00a0\nProjected benefit obligation\n(61)\n69\u00a0\nThe expected long-term rate of return is based on the asset allocation, historical performance and the current view of expected future returns. AbbVie considers these inputs with a long-term focus to avoid short-term market influences. The current long-term rate of return on plan assets for each plan is supported by the historical performance of the trust's actual and target asset allocation. AbbVie's assumed expected long-term rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of December\u00a031, 2021 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2022. A one\u00a0percentage point change in assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2022 by $101\u00a0million.\nThe health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases. The current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of each plan. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of December\u00a031, 2021 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2022. \nIncome Taxes\nAbbVie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nLitigation\nThe company is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. Accordingly, AbbVie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore, the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected.\nValuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nAbbVie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that AbbVie records at fair value. Transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur between companies in \n2021 Form 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n46\nthe pharmaceuticals industry and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating the stage of completion. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset. IPR&D acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval is obtained, at which time it is accounted for as a definite-lived asset and amortized over its estimated useful life, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. IPR&D acquired in transactions that are not business combinations is expensed immediately, unless deemed to have an alternative future use. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life.\nAbbVie reviews the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event occurs that could result in an impairment. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAnnually, the company tests its goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. Some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macro-economic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors, the overall financial performance and whether there have been sustained declines in the company's share price. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. AbbVie tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. \nFor its quantitative impairment tests, the company uses an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, the selection of an appropriate discount rate, asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with the company's business plans and a market participant's views. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and could potentially impact the company's results of operations. Actual results may differ from the company's estimates.\nContingent\n \nConsideration\nThe fair value measurements of contingent consideration liabilities are determined as of the acquisition date based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities and timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. Contingent consideration liabilities are revalued to fair value at each subsequent reporting date until the related contingency is resolved. The potential contingent consideration payments are estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of inputs, including discount rates, the probabilities of achieving the milestones, the time required to achieve the milestones and estimated future sales. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of certain of these inputs, which are disclosed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes to the inputs described above could have a material impact on the company's financial position and results of operations in any given period.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on recent accounting pronouncements.\n47 \n \n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n2021 Form 10-K", "item7a": ">ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe company is exposed to risk that its earnings, cash flows and equity could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Certain derivative instruments are used when available on a cost-effective basis to hedge the company's underlying economic exposures. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the company's financial instruments and hedging strategies.\nForeign Currency Risk\nAbbVie's primary net foreign currency exposures are the Euro, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan and British pound. The following table reflects the total foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at December\u00a031, 2021 and 2020:\n2021\n2020\nas of December\u00a031 (in millions)\nContract amount\nWeighted average exchange rate\nFair and carrying value receivable/(payable)\nContract amount\nWeighted average exchange rate\nFair and carrying value receivable/(payable)\nReceive primarily U.S. dollars in exchange for the following currencies:\nEuro\n$\n10,253\u00a0\n1.155\u00a0\n$\n195\u00a0\n$\n7,818\u00a0\n1.213\u00a0\n$\n(39)\nChinese yuan\n673\u00a0\n6.400\u00a0\n(1)\n247\u00a0\n6.584\u00a0\n(1)\nBritish pound\n605\u00a0\n1.331\u00a0\n9\u00a0\n275\u00a0\n1.341\u00a0\n3\u00a0\nJapanese yen\n602\u00a0\n113.3\u00a0\n9\u00a0\n837\u00a0\n103.9\u00a0\n(7)\nCanadian dollar\n571\u00a0\n1.258\u00a0\n9\u00a0\n591\u00a0\n1.328\u00a0\n(23)\nAll other currencies\n1,549\u00a0\nn/a\n5\u00a0\n1,459\nn/a\n(14)\nTotal\n$\n14,253\u00a0\n$\n226\u00a0\n$\n11,227\u00a0\n$\n(81)\nThe company estimates that a 10% appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant, would decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by $1.4 billion at December\u00a031, 2021. If realized, this appreciation would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. However, gains and losses on the hedging instruments offset losses and gains on the hedged transactions and reduce the earnings and stockholders' equity volatility relating to foreign exchange. A 10% appreciation is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in foreign currencies.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2021, the company has \u20ac5.9 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior Euro notes outstanding, which are exposed to foreign currency risk. The company designated these foreign currency denominated notes as hedges of its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. As a result, any foreign currency translation gains or losses related to the Euro notes will be included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding to the senior Euro notes and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding to the net investment hedging program. \nInterest Rate Risk\nThe company estimates that an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would adversely impact the fair value of AbbVie's interest rate swap contracts by approximately $244 million at December\u00a031, 2021. If realized, the fair value reduction would affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts. The company estimates that an increase of 100 basis points in long-term interest rates would decrease the fair value of long-term debt by $5.0 billion at December\u00a031, 2021. A 100 basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in interest rates. \n2021 Form 10-K\u00a0\u00a0\n \n|\n\u00a0\u00a0\n48", "companyName": "Abbvie INC", "cusip": "00287Y109"}
