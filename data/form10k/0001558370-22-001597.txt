We provide satellite imagery as visual evidence of ground truth to promote global transparency and expose injustice. Access to our high-resolution satellite imagery has enabled journalists to accurately report on areas that are too remote or dangerous to visit or are otherwise inaccessible.\n\u200b\nOur Constellation\n\u200b\nAs of December 31, 2021, we operated a constellation of four in-orbit and fully commissioned satellites: GeoEye-1, WorldView-1, WorldView-2 and WorldView-3. Our annual collection capacity is approximately 1.4\u00a0billion square kilometers. We have collected, and have available for use, approximately 137 petabytes in our Image Library.\n\u200b\nWe re-evaluate the depreciable lives of our satellites annually based on established methodologies used for accounting purposes. The lives we assign for depreciation purposes are typically shorter than the lives we use for planning purposes and our history shows that in most cases the estimated useful lives of our satellites have increased from the initial lives determined upon launch.\n\u200b\nThe following table summarizes the primary characteristics of the in-orbit and fully-commissioned satellites in our constellation as of December 31, 2021:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nSatellite\n\u200b\nLaunch Date\n\u200b\nExpected End of Depreciable Life\n\u200b\nBest Ground Resolution\n\u200b\nOrbital Altitude (kilometers)\nWorldView-3\n\u200b\nAugust 2014\n\u200b\nQ1 2026\n\u200b\n31-centimeters black and white, or color 1.24-meter multi-spectral\n\u200b\n618\nWorldView-2\n\u200b\nOctober 2009\n\u200b\nQ4 2023\n\u200b\n46-centimeters black and white, or color 1.84-meter multi-spectral\n\u200b\n770\nWorldView-1\n\u200b\nSeptember 2007\n\u200b\nQ4 2023\n\u200b\n50-centimeters panchromatic \n\u200b\n496\nGeoEye-1\n\u200b\nSeptember 2008\n\u200b\nQ3 2023\n\u200b\n41-centimeters black and white, or color 1.64-meter multi-spectral\n\u200b\n681\n5\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u200b\n\u200b\nWorldView Legion will be a fleet of six high performing satellites for which our Space Infrastructure segment is acting as prime contractor. With a first launch planned in June to July of 2022, we expect that WorldView Legion, in addition to our current constellation, will revisit rapidly changing areas up to 15 times per day, an increase from four times per day currently, which will more than triple both our capacity to collect 30 cm class imagery and our overall capacity in high demand areas.\n\u200b\nOur satellites have advanced technical capabilities, such as maneuverability, size of collection area, collection speed, revisit time, resolution, accuracy and spectral diversity. Additionally, our satellites are designed, manufactured and operated in the U.S. for assurance of U.S. national security missions and data protection.\n\u200b\nWe procure insurance to protect us from the risks associated with our satellite operations, including the partial or total loss of the functional capacity of the satellite. We insure satellites in our constellation to the extent that insurance is available at acceptable premiums. As of December\u00a031, 2021, we maintained the following insurance coverage on our in-orbit and fully-commissioned satellite constellation:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nSatellite\n\u200b\nPolicy Period\n\u200b\nCoverage\n(in millions)\nWorldView-3\n\u200b\n10/2021-10/2022\n\u200b\n$\n255\nWorldView-2\n\u200b\n10/2021-10/2022\n\u200b\n\u200b\n220\nWorldView-1\n\u200b\n10/2021-10/2022\n\u200b\n\u200b\n220\nGeoEye-1\n\u200b\n10/2021-10/2022\n\u200b\n\u200b\n38\n\u200b\nAdditionally, as of December 31, 2021, we have procured insurance for our WorldView Legion satellite launches of $520 million. These policies cover the launches plus the first year in orbit. Following the first year in orbit, we will seek to obtain in-orbit coverage similar to the coverage we currently have on our in-orbit and fully-commissioned satellite constellation noted in the table above.\n\u200b\nCompetitive Conditions and Trends in Industry Demands\n\u200b\nOur Earth Intelligence business operates in a highly competitive and rapidly growing industry. Our major existing and potential competitors for our Earth Intelligence business include commercial satellite imagery companies, state-owned imagery providers, aerial imagery companies, free sources of imagery, unmanned aerial vehicles and companies that provide geospatial analytic information and services to the U.S. government, including defense prime contractors.\n\u200b\nWe compete on the basis of several factors, including: the technical capabilities of our satellites, such as size of collection area, collection speed, revisit time, resolution, accuracy and spectral diversity; satellite availability for tasked orders; the size, comprehensiveness and relevance of our Image Library; on-demand platforms and tools that enable customers to easily access and integrate imagery; value-added services, including \nharnessing advancements in ML by \n6\n\n\nTable of Contents\napplying computer vision and pattern analysis technology to geospatial problems; and derivative products such as 3D models and map vector data.\n\u200b\nThe Earth observation market includes the collection and processing of optical and non-optical imagery data of the Earth. Specifically, the market is segmented into Data, Value-Added Services (\u201cVAS\u201d), Information Products and Big Data Analytics. The Data segment consists of raw imagery transmitted from the satellite to the ground station and products, such as stereo imaging and basic corrections (radiometric and geometric). VAS includes processing through layering or data fusion (such as with traffic information and street names). Big Data Analytics includes statistical analysis, change detection and predictive modeling using large quantities of imagery and meta-data overlays to provide insights over a given period of time.\n\u200b\nOur Earth Intelligence business provides Earth observation services to customers in a variety of sectors, including defense\u00a0and intelligence, energy\u00a0and natural resources, industrials, social media, mapping, managed living resources (such as agriculture and forestry), public authorities, services (such as finance, insurance, news and media) and weather. Providers of imagery and data in this market generally compete on resolution, accuracy, revisit frequency, delivery (cloud versus traditional) and pricing.\n\u200b\nEuroconsult \nreports that the commercial market for Earth observation data was $1.6 billion in 2020 and is forecasted to top $2.5 billion by 2030, a compound annual growth rate of 4%. According to \nEuroconsult, \ndefense represents approximately 70% of the Earth observation data, and sales to non-U.S. defense markets are forecasted to be the most significant driver of revenue growth, driven by higher revisit constellations with higher resolutions. \nEuroconsult \nreports the commercial market for Earth observation VAS was $2.5 billion in 2020 and is forecasted to top $5 billion by 2030, a compound annual growth rate of 7%. We believe it is increasingly likely that value for the Earth observation services will be driven by downstream services and AI-enabled data analytics.\n\u200b\nIn addition to the demands for commercial Earth observation data and VAS, we believe our Earth Intelligence offerings address a number of multi-billion dollar military use-cases and sectors, including 3D mapping, precision guided munitions and military simulation and virtual training. Additionally, as we further develop our 3D offerings, we see additional commercial market opportunities for our data and services, particularly within the immersive 3D environments of the augmented reality (\u201cAR\u201d)/virtual reality (\u201cVR\u201d) accessed metaverse. As consumers spend more time in virtual or AR environments for education, gaming, entertainment, news, networking, shopping and more, our global 3D models can help bridge the physical and digital worlds with increased accuracy and realism.\n\u200b\nSpace Infrastructure\n\u200b\nOverview\n\u200b\nIn the Space Infrastructure segment, we provide solutions for communications, Earth observation, remote sensing, on-orbit servicing, robotic assembly and space exploration. We address a broad spectrum of needs for our customers, including mission systems engineering, product design, spacecraft manufacturing, assembly, integration and testing. Our principal customers in the Space Infrastructure segment are commercial satellite operators and government agencies worldwide. Our approach combines proven success gained over six decades in the industry with the nimbleness and agility of a smaller space company.\n\u200b\nOur Offerings\nOur products, which are designed and manufactured in the U.S., include:\n\u25cf\nCommunications and imaging satellites and payloads;\n\u25cf\nPlatforms for space exploration and hosting instruments for Earth science;\n\u25cf\nSpace subsystems for power, propulsion and communication;\n\u25cf\nSatellite ground systems and support services;\n7\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u25cf\nSpace-based remote sensing-solutions;\n\u25cf\nSpace robotics; and\n\u25cf\nDefense systems.\nSpacecraft\n\u200b\nToday, more than 287 custom Maxar-built spacecraft, including 81 low Earth orbit (\u201cLEO\u201d) satellites, have launched with a combined 2,850 years of service, the majority of the spacecraft are highly complex Geosynchronous Equatorial Orbit (\u201cGEO\u201d) satellites for global communications customers.\n\u200b\nMaxar continues as a world leader in commercial GEO communication satellites and a global leader in commercial satellite manufacturing. With three decades of on-orbit heritage, our 1300 spacecraft platform is the world\u2019s most popular GEO satellite; 90 spacecraft are currently in service, providing 99.9993% uptime availability for our customers. We continue to provide a high level of value and partnership to communications customers around the globe. Key platform features include a scalable, lightweight and high-strength structure, fuel-efficient attitude and station-keeping subsystems, high-efficiency and reliable solar arrays and batteries and advanced command and control subsystems. A growing application for commercial geostationary communication satellites is the delivery of data-centric applications (such as consumer broadband, in-flight communication, maritime and 4G/5G cellular backhaul) via\u00a0high-capacity\u00a0spot beam satellites commonly referred to as high throughput satellites (or \u201cHTS\u201d).\u00a0We introduced the first HTS satellite in 2005, which used the 1300\u202fbus, and believe\u00a0it offers the highest capability for the cost. Maxar is building JUPITER 3, a transformational Ultra High Density Satellite, for Hughes Network Systems (\u201cHughes\u201d) to be designated EchoStar XXIV. This satellite is expected to be the world\u2019s largest commercial communications satellite when it launches, and will power future generations of Hughes consumer, enterprise and aeronautical services across the Americas. \n\u200b\nIn addition to continued leadership in the commercial communications sector, we collaborate closely with customers to design and deliver smaller satellites to address growing demand for LEO and medium Earth orbit (\u201cMEO\u201d) constellations. We believe Maxar\u2019s LEO capabilities will be effective for applications that require a multiple satellite constellation of identical satellites produced in a cost-efficient manner.\n\u200b\nThe 1300 platform is key to our continued and growing partnership with NASA as well. The Psyche mission is a journey to a unique metal asteroid, named 16 Psyche, that appears to be the exposed metal core of an early planet\u2013a building block of a solar system. The spacecraft bus leverages the 1300 platform and solar electric propulsion system, the highly efficient SPT-140. In addition, Maxar is hosting NASA\u2019s Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (\u201cTEMPO\u201d)\u2014 a commercially hosted pollution monitoring payload on a commercial communications satellite Maxar is building for satellite operator Intelsat. By hosting payloads on its commercial satellites, Maxar can help government agencies obtain access to space for instruments, sensors and other small missions without the cost of building a dedicated spacecraft. Similarly, the hosted payload helps commercial customers share the cost of the satellite bus, launch and operations.\n\u200b\nCompetitive Conditions and Trends in Industry Demands\n\u200b\nOur principal customers in the Space Infrastructure segment are commercial satellite operators and government agencies worldwide.\n\u00a0\nWe sell our products and technologies in a highly competitive industry and we compete on the basis of cost, reliability, design life and technological capabilities and efficiencies. Our primary competitors for satellite manufacturing contracts are: The Boeing Company, Lockheed Martin Corporation and Northrop Grumman Corporation in the United States; Thales S.A. and Airbus Defence and Space, a subsidiary of the Airbus Group, in Europe; and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation in Japan. Additionally, we face competition from newer entrants. In addition, many of our competitors are \n8\n\n\nTable of Contents\nlarger and have greater resources than we do. We may also face competition in the future from emerging low-cost competitors in India, Russia and China.\n\u200b\nGEO satellites track with the rotation of the Earth and remain over a fixed point over the Earth\u2019s surface. GEO satellites cover more area from a higher vantage point to tend to carry more advanced sensor or communication suites, as used in broad area communications and global-scale weather payloads. Due to this unique property of their orbit, GEO orbit slots are limited, which motivates operators to maximize the use of their slot, leading to generally larger satellites to support the required power and bandwidth, as well as a longer design life to maximize return on investment. Due to their greater distance from earth; however, there is increased latency.\nThe satellite industry has undergone a significant change with the proliferation of LEO satellites, which have been primarily used for both Earth observation and communications payloads. Typically, LEO constellation satellites are cheaper to launch as they are significantly smaller and require less fuel to reach orbit. Additionally, due to the lower orbital altitude, LEO observation satellites enable higher resolution imagery. This factor also enables LEO communication satellites to reduce latency but require a much larger constellation to ensure coverage over a given area as unlike GEO satellites, LEO satellites move in and out of view of ground locations as they complete their orbit. In addition to altitude class, satellites are classified by functions, such as communications or Earth observation.\nEuroconsult \nprojects satellite demand will experience a four and half-fold increase over the next ten years. While LEO and MEO are expected to account for the majority of the demand, \nEuroconsult \nexpects an average of 13 GEO commercial satellite orders per year over the next ten years, representing one-third of the total market value. According to \nEuroconsult\n, the total market for manufacturing and launch services is expected to reach $320 billion over the next decade, a 39% increase from the previous decade of $230 billion in revenue.\n\u200b\nLEO proliferation is expected to greatly increase access to space, thus enabling new commercial customers across diversified industries including oil\u00a0& gas, insurance, agriculture and asset management firms, as well as nonprofit organizations, to benefit from satellite imagery.\n\u200b\nDiscontinued Operations\n\u200b\nOn April 8, 2020, we completed the sale of our former Canadian subsidiary (\u201cMDA\u00a0Business\u201d) to Neptune Acquisition Inc., a corporation existing under the laws of the Province of British Columbia and an affiliate of Northern Private Capital Ltd. See Note 4, \u201cDiscontinued Operations\u201d, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, \u201c\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n\u201d for additional information regarding our sale of the MDA Business.\n\u200b\nIndustry Overview\n\u200b\nLarge and Growing Addressable Market\n\u200b\nWe believe that there is potential for growth among three key components of our addressable market: the U.S. government, other governments and commercial customers. For both the U.S. and other governments, drivers of growth include persistent global security threats, defense budgets, demand for high-quality imagery and value-added services and a focus on space as an investment. We believe that the U.S. government is interested in expanding the use of commercial alternatives to owned assets and that other governments present an opportunity for growth. We seek to align our products and services with the U.S. Department of Defense (\u201cDoD\u201d)\u2019s National Defense Strategy needs, as well as growing international defense and intelligence demand. For civil customers, in particular NASA, growth is being driven by space exploration programs such as Artemis and Earth science projects. For commercial customers, drivers of growth include strong demand for 3D imagery and more frequent imagery refreshes, as well as insights driven by AI and ML, space-based remote sensing, GEO replacement demand and LEO communications programs.\n\u200b\nDiverse Solutions for Diverse End-Market Users\n\u200b\nWhile traditionally spending in space has been dominated by military defense programs and the communications industry, the proliferation of technology and cheaper access to space has led to a diversification in end-market users. \n9\n\n\nTable of Contents\nML, AI and cloud computing have given rise to multiple use cases across industries, such as mobility and logistics, insurance, finance, ESG, non-governmental organizations and emerging technologies in simulation, gaming, AR/VR and the metaverse. Concurrently, geopolitical competition in space as a contested domain is leading to further investment by global militaries. We have evolved with this changing environment to serve a multitude of customers.\n\u200b\nGovernment Investment in Space Programs\n\u200b\nWith more than half of our revenues coming from U.S. government customers, we expect that our Space Infrastructure and Earth Intelligence segments will benefit from growing defense and space infrastructure budgets. We expect the proliferation of space-based intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and communications to drive increased government investments in the sector through the mid-2020s.\n\u200b\nGlobal\nEuroconsult \nreports that government space budgets reached $92.5 billion in 2021, an 8% increase over 2020 figures. Additionally, \nEuroconsult \nreports the gap between civil and defense space budgets is decreasing, with civil budgets totaling $53.5 billion and defense space programs totaling $38.9 billion in 2021. \nEuroconsult \nexpects world defense spending to average over 2.5% growth per year until 2030, driven by increasing government defense budgets, an emphasis on space security and a generalized trend of the militarization of space.\nUnited States\nIn the U.S., there is a concerted effort by the government to accelerate space investment. According to the \nCongressional Research Service,\n the President\u2019s fiscal year (\u201cFY\u201d) 2022 budget requested $15.3\u00a0billion for the National Security Space (\u201cNSS\u201d) programs, representing growth of 13% from the aggregate funding for NSS programs of $13.5 billion for FY 2021. On December 20, 2019, with the enactment of the FY 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, the U.S. Space Force (\u201cUSSF\u201d) was established. The mission of the USSF is to organize, train and equip space forces in order to protect the U.S. and allied interests in space and to provide space capabilities to the joint force.\nThe NSS budget generally excludes funding for the NRO and NGA. Specific funding levels for these organizations, which are long-term historical customers of our Earth Intelligence segment, are generally classified. However, the NRO and NGA are included in the funding for the National Intelligence Program (\u201cNIP\u201d). The aggregate funding for the NIP was $60.2 billion in FY 2019, $62.7 billion in FY 2020 and $60.8 billion in FY 2021. The NIP funding request for FY 2022 is $62.3 billion. Additionally, the aggregate funding for the Military Intelligence Program (\u201cMIP\u201d) was $21.5 billion in FY 2019, $23.1 billion in FY 2020 and $23.3 billion in FY 2021. The MIP funding request for FY 2022 is $23.3 billion.\nFurthermore, NASA requested $24.8 billion in FY 2022, an increase of 7% from FY 2021. The NASA budget further highlights an effort by the government to invest in space exploration and development, with $8.3 billion of the total allocated for deep space exploration systems and space technology. These include the key components of OSAM-1 and the Artemis program that will send astronauts to the Moon and beyond, including the Lunar Gateway.\n\u200b\nGrowth Strategy\nOur vision is to hold leading positions in each of the sectors we serve. We aim to achieve this by applying innovative technologies and capabilities that provide value to our customers across their entire value chain, including components, subsystems, systems, data and services. Specific elements of our strategy across our two segments include:\nEarth Intelligence\nDriving revenue growth through improvements in our products\n\u2014 we seek to improve and develop new Earth intelligence products with WorldView Legion by productizing technologies and derivative content developed in support of individual customer contracts, such as using more artificial intelligence and machine learning to extract features, detect objects and detect change in our satellite imagery and complementary content. We believe we provide imagery \n10\n\n\nTable of Contents\nwith better than three times the accuracy of the nearest small-sat competitor and we believe that our accuracy advantage is even greater in areas where we have leveraged our 3D and elevation capabilities. We believe we will be able to provide even greater quality imagery and with higher revisit rates upon deployment of our WorldView Legion constellation. The revisit rate and increase in capacity enables a clearer understanding of on ground conditions, allowing for more real time, actionable analysis to deliver insights on rapidly changing environments and populations, while providing for more frequent monitoring for defense and intelligence applications, enhanced emergency responsiveness and maritime surveillance, among other applications. We have developed technology used to enhance the quality and usability of imagery (e.g. eliminate atmospheric distortions, increase positional accuracy, improved interpretability, etc.), create information derivatives (e.g. road vectors, material types, land classification, etc.), fuse multiple types of content (e.g. Internet of Things, optical imagery, synthetic aperture radar imagery, radio frequency information, vectors, social media, etc.), to detect change, understand patterns of life and gain early warning of trending events. We believe this type of high resolution, highly accurate collection capacity will power wide-area, artificial intelligence and machine learning modeling, sensor-to-shooter applications and a reference globe for AR/VR metaverse applications. Additionally, we believe our resolution and accuracy are key enablers for deriving highly accurate and lifelike 3D models, which will allow customers to transition from 2D to 3D capabilities that address critical missions such as GPS-denied navigation, digital twin simulations, synthetic and real-world training environments, autonomous vehicle routing and telco network planning.\u00a0We believe that creating standard products using this technology will grow our product-based revenue with customers in the technology, defense and intelligence, civil government and global development organization sectors.\n\u200b\nExpanding our relationship with the U.S. government\n\u2014the U.S. government is the largest customer of our Earth Intelligence segment through the EnhancedView Contract, G-EGD and OWT programs and various classified and unclassified contract vehicles. Demand for geospatial intelligence and services continues to grow given the geopolitical environment and the confluence of high-performance computing and machine learning algorithms that allow for insights to be extracted from ever greater levels of data being produced by Earth observation sensors and national and commercial satellite assets. The U.S. government has expressed interest in increasingly relying on commercial partners to harness the rapid pace of commercial innovation more effectively, including the continued use of geospatial data given cost affordability and advances in technology that provide high quality imagery. We seek to grow our business with the U.S. government by leveraging the investments we have made across our capability set, including in ML and AI and our strong record of historic performance.\n\u200b\nGrowing our installed base and penetration of international defense and intelligence customers\n\u2014we currently provide service to U.S.-allied nations through our DAP, RAP, SecureWatch, Precision 3D products. These customers use our imagery in their civil and intelligence related missions. Our imagery and services are either complementary to national assets owned by these countries, or in some cases defer the need for a country to invest in owned and operated national assets. We believe there are many prospective customers that have both the mission need and budget for our services which we seek to add to our installed base. We also seek to further penetrate existing customers through the provision of additional data and services. Lastly, we believe there are opportunities to provide our services to U.S. allied nations who might seek a complement to national capabilities in geospatial analytics. Our strategy focuses on those countries that currently have deep and longstanding relationships with our Earth Intelligence segment and other close U.S. allies.\n\u200b\nGrowing with and expanding our installed base among enterprise customers\n\u2014we have over 400\u00a0enterprise customers that use our data in their products and applications across a variety of industries including technology, telecom, transportation, mining, mapping, social media and oil and gas. The confluence of high-performance computing and ML algorithms are allowing for insights to be extracted from ever greater quantities of imagery and meta data, which in turn is driving innovation across our customer base. We expect this trend to continue, and we seek to grow with our existing customers as well as to grow our install-base in new industry verticals by leveraging our sector leading imagery capabilities. Furthermore, we believe our capabilities in ML, AI and Big Data Analytics products will position us to sell additional solutions and services to our commercial customers.\n\u200b\nProviding products that leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence\n\u2014 AI and ML \nenable us to extract greater insight from our geospatial data to deliver actionable intelligence to our customers. We have continued to refine and improve our approach to AI and ML, which benefit from our large volumes of historical training data and high quality \n11\n\n\nTable of Contents\nimagery. Productization of this capability will enable delivery of higher value, enriched geospatial data that we expect will facilitate deeper penetration of the U.S. government, international governments and commercial markets.\n\u200b\nDelivering 3D products to global defense, intelligence and commercial customers\n \n\u2013 through Maxar\u2019s acquisition of Vricon, we are expanding the demand for global scale 3D products. 3D products allow decision makers to understand their operational environment in 3D \u2013 developing new insights that enable them to make better, faster decisions. We see a growing opportunity to sell 3D data and software products to the military and intelligence community to support virtual training environments and provide better information to the warfighter. U.S. and allied defense and intelligence customers are seeking solutions to support intelligence fusion, maneuver and other mission requirements. We also see significant opportunity with our commercial customers as they look for more accurate 3D geodata to deliver their products through new mediums like AR and VR. Additionally, we have entered into license arrangements related to certain consumer applications. The current investment in 5G networks and Internet of Things provides a unique opportunity to deliver network operators a better data solution to improve their future networks. Additional use cases continue to grow as 3D products and precision data sets become better understood.\n\u200b\nSpace Infrastructure\nDriving revenue through improvement in our products and manufacturing and program capabilities\n\u2014 we are developing differentiated capabilities that are designed for future space exploration, including propulsion, power and robotics. We believe these elements will be critical to helping our customers operate in an increasingly contested space environment and in achieving successful space exploration missions. We are also developing our satellite architectures and manufacturing capabilities as we strive to assure that we can successfully fulfill both government and commercial customer requirements on future programs, including high volume / low mix and variable volume / high mix programs. We plan to team with providers of digital payload technology to enhance our offering if our customers express interest in it. We are also developing relationships across the supply chain to assure that we can seamlessly provide a broad-breadth of mission sets to our customers. Finally, we are working to transform our operations (e.g. location strategy, workforce shaping, technology and systems investment and CAS / FAR compliance) so that we can address a larger set of opportunities across our government and commercial customers.\n\u200b\nGrowing our U.S. and international civil exposure\n\u2014we have a long history with civil space programs dating back to the Apollo missions. Current NASA programs include the Power Propulsion Element for the Lunar Gateway, OSAM-1, Psyche and TEMPO. We have also built robotic arms on six of NASA\u2019s Mars rovers and landers. We seek to leverage our investments and expertise in propulsion, power and robotics, as well as our strong legacy of performance, when pursuing further civil work in the U.S. and abroad.\n\u200b\nDeepening our penetration of U.S. national programs\n\u2014to date, we have won several classified and unclassified study contracts with U.S. defense and intelligence customers. We seek to further penetrate these markets by utilizing our flexible satellite architectures, design and engineering capabilities and commercial business practices\u2014all of which we believe can create compelling value propositions.\n\u200b\nProviding flexible platforms to our commercial customers\n\u2014we currently provide components, subsystems and system architectures to our customers for communications and Earth observation satellites in LEO, MEO and GEO orbits. In communications, we offer flexible platforms across various architecture platforms and mission payloads from standard analog to high throughput, and we are investing in digital solutions. In Earth observation, we also offer flexible solutions across various architecture platforms and mission payloads, including electro-optic. Our goal is to be positioned well to compete for future single satellite or full constellation build orders from our customers, across a wide range of the architectures, payloads or Earth orbit chosen to fulfill mission requirements.\n\u200b\nGovernment Contracts and Compliance with Government Regulations\n\u200b\nOur operations are heavily regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws. Our operations in the U.S. government market are subject to significant government regulation. We contract with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including branches of the U.S. military and NASA. We must comply with, and are affected by, laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government and other \n12\n\n\nTable of Contents\ngovernments\u2019 contracts, including foreign governments. Compliance with legislation or regulations promulgated by these authorities could result in material adverse effects on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position. In addition, noncompliance with legislation or regulations promulgated by these authorities could result in limitations on, or the suspension or revocation of, our licenses or registrations, the termination or loss of contracts or the imposition of contractual damages, civil fines or criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, any government policy changes, which may be substantial, could increase regulatory uncertainty. The adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business. In addition, the manner in which regulations or legislation in these areas may be interpreted and enforced cannot be precisely determined, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional information about the government regulations affecting our business and the risks relating to government contracts and regulations appears in \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\u200b\nU.S. Government Contracts\nAll of our reportable segments have contracts with various governmental entities, which are concentrated in a small number of primary contracts.\u00a0The U.S. government may terminate or suspend our contracts, including the EnhancedView Contract with the U.S. government in our Earth Intelligence segment, at any time with or without cause. The EnhancedView Contract includes three option years that commenced on September 1, 2020. The second option year was exercised on July 15, 2021 for a one-year term ending on August 31, 2022. The final option year, if exercised by the U.S. government, has a term from September 1, 2022 through July 12, 2023. In November 2021, the NRO announced the release of the EOCL RFP, which is expected to replace the existing EnhancedView Contract. In December 2021, we submitted our response to the EOCL RFP and anticipate the NRO to award EOCL contracts prior to the expiration of the EnhancedView Contract, including remaining option years. Any changes in the size, scope or term of the EnhancedView Contract, or any award we receive for the EOCL, could impact our satellite replenishment strategy and our ability to repay or refinance our long-term debt. Although our U.S. government contracts generally involve fixed annual minimum commitments, such commitments, along with all other contracts with the U.S. government, are subject to annual Congressional appropriations and the federal budget process and as a result, the U.S. government may not continue to fund these contracts at current or anticipated levels. The loss or reduction in scope of any one of our primary U.S. government contracts would materially reduce our revenue and adversely impact our operating results and competitive position.\n\u200b\nForeign Operations\n\u200b\nOur international contracts may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific in-country purchases, investments, manufacturing agreements or other financial obligations, known as offset obligations, and provide for penalties in the event we fail to meet such requirements.\n\u200b\nEnvironmental Regulations\n\u200b\nOur operations are regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws governing the environment, including laws governing the discharge of pollutants into the soil, air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We have infrastructure in place to ensure that our operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental regulations. We do not believe that the costs of compliance with these laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, operating results or competitive position. The imposition of more stringent standards or requirements under environmental laws or regulations or a determination that we are responsible for the release of hazardous substances at our sites could result in expenditures in excess of amounts currently estimated to be required for such matters. We have been designated, along with numerous other companies, as a potentially responsible party for the clean-up of several hazardous waste sites. Based on available information, we do not believe that any costs incurred in connection with such sites will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, capital expenditures or competitive position. \n13\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThere can be no assurance that additional environmental matters will not arise in the future, or that costs will not be incurred with respect to sites at which no problem is currently known.\n\u200b\nResources\n\u200b\nIntellectual Property\n\u200b\nWe own a substantial intellectual property portfolio that includes many U.S. and foreign patents, as well as many U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names and copyrights.\u00a0We actively pursue internal development of intellectual property.\u00a0In addition to our patent portfolio, we own other intellectual property such as unpatented trade secrets, know-how, data and software.\u00a0Additionally, we rely on licenses of certain intellectual property to conduct our business operations, including certain proprietary rights to and from third parties.\u00a0While our\u00a0intellectual\u00a0property rights in the aggregate are important to our operations, we do not believe that any particular trade secret, patent, trademark, copyright, license or other\u00a0intellectual\u00a0property right is of such importance that its loss, expiration or termination would have a material effect on our business.\n\u200b\nRaw Materials\n\u200b\nOur businesses are generally engaged in limited manufacturing activities and have minimal near-term exposure to fluctuations in the supply of raw materials. For those businesses that manufacture and sell products and systems, most of the value that we provide is labor oriented, such as design, engineering, assembly and test activities. In manufacturing our products, we use our own production capabilities as well as third-party suppliers and subcontractors. Certain aspects of our manufacturing activities require relatively scarce raw materials or specialty component parts; occasionally, we have experienced difficulty in our ability to procure raw materials, components, sub-assemblies and other supplies required in our manufacturing processes. Recent supply shortages related to electronic chips is an example of some of the challenges we face with materials. As we have several firm fixed price contracts, we bear some risk to supply chain delivery issues and price increases.\n\u200b\nResearch and Development\n\u200b\nWe have a history of investing in development of technological advancements in our field of aerospace. We have both internally and externally funded research and development projects.\u00a0Our current and future business is dependent on developing new enhancements and technology that go into our existing and future products and services.\u00a0Our annual research and development expenses from continuing operations were $27 million in 2021, $15 million in 2020 and $10 million in 2019.\u00a0We intend to continue our focus on research and development and product and service enhancements as a key strategy for innovation and growth.\u00a0One of our current areas of focus is our development of the WorldView Legion program, a capital project, and other new offerings within our Earth Intelligence segment, including 3D technology. In our Space Infrastructure segment, we are also focused on the further development of components to be used in a variety of our products. Our efforts will continue to be directed into fields that we believe offer the greatest opportunities for long-term growth and profitability.\u00a0\n\u200b\nHuman Capital \n\u200b\nWe endeavor to cultivate a positive employee experience as we deliver on Maxar and customer missions by attracting, engaging and growing current and future Maxar team members; creating strong partnerships across the business; \n14\n\n\nTable of Contents\nchampioning culture and fostering an inclusive and diverse environment; and impacting the broader community. We take great pride in our values:\n\u200b\n\u200b\nBehind the words are leaders, managers and team members who believe in our values and live by them. As of December 31, 2021, we employed 4,400 team members globally of which 96% are U.S. based and 4% are international. Within the U.S., no team members are unionized, while in Europe a small number of team members are represented by a trade union. Additionally, Maxar employs a highly technical workforce, with 77% of our employees working in engineering or operations functions and the remainder in our sales and general and administrative functions.\n\u200b\nAttracting Talent\n\u200b\nThe success of Maxar\u2019s business depends largely on our ability to attract, engage and grow a diverse population of talented technical and skilled team members at all levels. To succeed in highly competitive labor markets and for skill sets that are scarce in the market, we have developed talent acquisition, team member engagement and total rewards strategies, to achieve and maintain a competitive position.\n\u200b\nTotal Rewards\n\u200b\nOur employee rewards programs are designed to provide an innovative, competitive, sustainable and scalable package that allows us to compete for and retain top talent in our industry and markets, aligned with Maxar\u2019s business and strategic objectives.\n\u200b\nWe strive to offer comprehensive benefits at a highly competitive cost-share to U.S. team members, including health insurance, direct round-the-clock access to doctors virtually and on-site, an array of targeted wellbeing programs, paid and unpaid leave, parental leave for all new parents for birth or adoption, retirement, life and disability programs, voluntary benefit options flexible to individual team member and family needs, tuition reimbursement, student loan forgiveness, adoption reimbursement, pet insurance and enhanced mental and emotional health support.\n\u200b\nIn order to encourage our value \u201cWe Act Like Owners\u201d, we offer an Employee Stock Purchase Plan with a discount for team members in countries where it is practical to offer the program. We also offer short- and long-term incentive programs to eligible team members.\n\u200b\nOutside of the U.S., we provide benefits, retirement and time-off in countries where we have a meaningful population of team members, designed based upon, among other things, market-specific practices and culture alignment.\n\u200b\nEngaging Talent\n\u200b\nWe are driving a listening culture at Maxar through programs that regularly seek to engage team members in an ongoing dialogue through town-halls, surveys, quarterly check-ins and listening sessions. We focus on topics including Maxar strategy and business updates, understanding leadership effectiveness, communications clarity and other areas for improvements. In 2021, we devoted special attention to our continued response to the pandemic and how team members were faring. For both ongoing and targeted pulse surveys the results are shared with leaders and team members, and our executive team analyzes areas for future focus and prioritization in response to the feedback to drive meaningful improvement in team member engagement.\n\u200b\n15\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn 2021, we launched a major leadership development initiative focused on upskilling leadership competencies tied to our Maxar leadership framework. Our outreach included a leader learning series focused on timely leadership topics, entry level manager development and a senior leadership and networking program, Catalyst.\n\u200b\nDiversity, Inclusion and Belonging\n\u200b\nAs a purpose-driven organization built on our values, our Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging (\u201cDIB\u201d) strategy is to foster a culture of inclusion and belonging. We know that our greatest strength comes from our team members. When our team members feel like they belong and their opinions are respected, everyone can perform to their greatest potential.\u00a0\n\u200b\nWe are committed to this journey and will stay curious and focused on\u00a0cultivating an inclusive environment\u00a0that promotes and values diversity, inclusion and belonging. Maxar, as a values-based company, makes this a priority, not just because it\u2019s the right thing to do, but because it makes Maxar stronger.\u00a0\n\u200b\nThe DIB strategy is a three-pronged approach that informs and guides us in this journey to:\n1.\nBuild a diverse, high-performing workforce by focusing on increasing diverse candidates in early career roles and in technical positions.\n2.\nFoster a culture of inclusion and belonging by growing inclusive leaders and increasing cultural awareness. \n3.\nMake an impact in the community and marketplace through together the efforts of the Maxar Better World Foundation.\nWe are committed to transparency along this journey and our 2021 data of our U.S. workforce is below:\n\u200b\n16\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u200b\nCOVID-19 Response\n\u200b\nTeam member health and safety is core to our successful operations across all areas of our business including manufacturing and satellite operations environments and our work at customer sites. We have taken significant actions over the past two years to address risk factors associated with COVID-19 and business continuity:\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nOur COVID-19 Response Team comprised of facilities, safety, security, HR, IT and business leaders, meets regularly and will continue as the pandemic evolves.\n\u25cf\nWe conducted several pulse surveys of our team members, with special focus on our COVID-19 response and opportunities for improvement to ensure we understood team member concerns and could proactively address those concerns.\n\u25cf\nWe focused on continuous communication and resources for team members, including open question and answer forums, health & safety updates, benefits and mental health, exposure notifications and travel information.\n\u25cf\nTo provide for the health and safety of our workforce and business continuity, we have implemented a Vaccination Policy which requires that Maxar employees are vaccinated for COVID-19 unless they have an approved accommodation. As an interim step to implementing this policy, we provided free daily on-site testing for our unvaccinated population for a portion of 2021.\n\u25cf\nAll of our facilities are open and operational to support business operations. We continually monitor and assess the locations and team member status to ensure we continue to operate safely for all stakeholders.\n\u200b\nAvailable Information\n\u200b\nOur website can be accessed at http://www.maxar.com.\u00a0The website contains information about us and our operations.

This impact could be more significant in the future, which could negatively impact revenue.\u00a0In many instances,\u00a0COVID-19 represents a force majeure event and as such, we have notified certain customers that we will be exercising our contractual legal rights, and in some\u00a0instances\u00a0we have made claims exercising such rights, given the uncertain nature of the current pandemic and its near and long-term impacts on the cost and schedule of the\u00a0numerous programs in our existing backlog. Additionally, our customers may slow down their development of new projects or may experience financial difficulties impacting their ability to fund projects already in backlog.\u00a0\n\u200b\nChanges in our operations in response to COVID-19 and employee illnesses resulting from the pandemic have resulted in inefficiencies and delays of our projects, impacts to service level contracts, including in sales and product development efforts and additional costs related to business continuity initiatives, that cannot be fully mitigated through succession planning or employees working remotely. We have delayed transition of our employees back into Maxar worksites due to increases in COVID-19 cases in the broad population. Additionally, to provide for the health and safety of our workforce and business continuity, we have implemented a Vaccination Policy which requires that Maxar employees are vaccinated for COVID-19 unless they have an approved accommodation. As of January 4, 2022, 99% of our U.S. based employees were in compliance with this policy and have either been vaccinated or received an accommodation.\n\u200b\nWe cannot predict the\u00a0degree to which, or the time period that, global economic conditions, the global supply chain and our sales and operations will continue to be affected by COVID-19 and preventative measures imposed from time to time by governments and businesses to prevent its spread.\u202fThe degree to which COVID-19 will continue to impact us will depend on numerous factors and future developments, including, but not limited to, the unknown duration of the pandemic, the impact of potential future resurgences and new virus variants and any actions that may be taken by governmental authorities to minimize the spread of the pandemic or to stimulate the economy. We also cannot predict the degree to which the disruption of global financial markets could have a negative impact on our ability to raise capital in the future. The long-term impacts of COVID-19 on government budgets and funding priorities that impact demand for our products and services are difficult to predict.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nEven after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may experience an impact to our business as a result of any economic downturn, recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future. The effects of these risks on our business, sales, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be material.\u00a0\n\u200b\n20\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe future revenue and operating results of the Space Infrastructure segment are dependent on our ability to generate a sustainable order rate for the satellite and space manufacturing operations and develop new technologies to meet the needs of our customers or potential new customers.\nThe Space Infrastructure segment\u2019s financial performance is dependent on its ability to generate a sustainable order rate for its satellite and space manufacturing operations. This can be challenging and may fluctuate on an annual basis as the number of satellite construction contracts awarded varies and in 2018 there was a substantial step down in the total number and dollar value of geostationary communication satellite contracts awarded compared to such historical averages prior to 2015. Many satellite operators in the communications industry have continued to defer new satellite construction awards to evaluate geostationary and other competing satellite system architectures and other market factors. If we are unable to win new awards or execute existing contracts as expected, our business, results of operations and financial position could be further adversely affected.\n\u200b\nThe cyclical nature of the commercial satellite market could negatively impact our ability to accurately forecast customer demand. The markets that we serve may not grow in the future and we may not be able to maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets. Specifically, sales of the 1300 bus have historically been important to our results and there is no assurance that this market will continue to grow or demand levels will increase, nor is there assurance that the market for the smaller bus, which spans a range from 500kg to 1300kg, will offset any decreases in the market for the 1300 bus or provide future growth.\u00a0Our growth is dependent on the growth in the sales of services provided by our customers, our customers\u2019 ability to anticipate market trends and our ability to anticipate changes in the businesses of our customers and to successfully identify and enter new markets. If we fail to anticipate such changes in demand, our business, results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.\n\u200b\nOn January 1, 2019, we completed a reorganization of our corporate structure pursuant to which we directly acquired\u00a0\nall of\n\u00a0the issued and outstanding shares of Maxar Technologies Ltd. (\u201cMaxar Canada\u201d) and we replaced Maxar Canada as the\u00a0\npublicly-held\n\u00a0parent company of the Maxar group (\u201cU.S. Domestication\u201d). A\ns part of our U.S. Domestication we believe that we will continue to capitalize on projected benefits within the Space Infrastructure segment. These benefits include anticipated growth within our U.S. government customer base as well as diversifying into national and civil missions. The failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u200b\nThe satellite manufacturing industry is driven by continued investment in technologies to meet changing customer demand for complex and reliable services. Our satellite systems embody complex technologies and may not always be compatible with current and evolving technical standards and systems developed by others. Other satellite manufacturers have developed or are developing digital payloads which increase flexibility for geostationary satellites in circumstances with unpredictable demand. We plan to team with providers of this technology to enhance our offering if our customers express interest in it. \n\u200b\nFailure or delays to develop technologies or team with providers to obtain technologies to meet the requisite and evolving industry or user standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Failure of suppliers to deliver against end customer requirements could lead to a material adverse effect on our financial results within the Space Infrastructure segment.\n\u200b\nOur business with various governmental entities is subject to the policies, priorities, regulations, mandates and funding levels of such governmental entities and may be negatively or positively impacted by any change thereto.\nChanges in government policies, priorities, regulations, use of commercial data providers to meet U.S. government imagery needs, government agency mandates, funding levels through agency budget reductions, the imposition of budgetary constraints or a decline in government support or deferment of funding for programs in which we or our customers participate could result in contract terminations, delays in contract awards, reduction in contract scope, performance penalties or breaches of our contracts, the failure to exercise contract options, the cancellation of planned procurements and fewer new business opportunities, all of which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u200b\n21\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to the procurement policies and procedures set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (\u201cFAR\u201d). FAR governs all aspects of government contracting, including contractor qualifications and acquisition procedures. The FAR provisions in U.S. government contracts must be complied with in order for the contract to be awarded and provides for audits and reviews of contract procurement, performance and administration. Failure to comply with the provisions of the FAR could result in contract termination.\n\u200b\nIn addition, contracts with any government, including the U.S. government, may be terminated or suspended by the government at any time and could result in significant liability obligations for us. We seek to have in place as standard provisions, termination for convenience language which reimburses us for reasonable costs incurred, subcontractor and employee termination and wind-down costs plus a reasonable amount of profit thereon. However, reparations for termination may fall short of the financial benefit associated with full completion and operation of a contract. In addition, we may not be able to procure new contracts to offset the revenue or backlog lost as a result of any termination of government contracts. The loss of one or more large contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See also \u201c\nOur business with various governmental entities is concentrated in a small number of primary contracts. The loss or reduction in scope of any one of our primary contracts would materially reduce our revenue\u201d \nbelow.\n\u200b\nOur revenue, results of operations and reputation may be negatively impacted if our programs fail to meet contractual requirements or our products contain defects or fail to operate in the expected manner.\nWe sell complex and technologically advanced systems, including satellites, products, hardware and software. Sophisticated software, including software developed by us, may contain defects that can unexpectedly interfere with the software\u2019s intended operation. Defects may also occur in components and products that we manufacture or purchase from third parties. Most of the satellites and systems we have developed must function under demanding and unpredictable operating conditions and in harsh and potentially destructive environments. In addition, we may agree to the in-orbit delivery of a satellite, adding further risks to our ability to perform under a contract. Failure to achieve successful in-orbit delivery could result in significant penalties and other obligations on us.\n\u200b\nWe employ sophisticated design and testing processes and practices, which include a range of stringent factory and on-site acceptance tests with criteria and requirements that are jointly developed with customers. Our systems may not be successfully implemented, pass required acceptance criteria, or operate or give the desired output, or we may not be able to detect and fix all defects in the satellites, products, hardware and software we sell or resolve any delays or availability issues in the launch services we procure. Failure to do so could result in increased costs, lost revenue and damage to our reputation and may adversely affect our ability to win new contract awards. We manufacture satellites with the intention of receiving full contractual value for builds; however, due to the inherent complexity, a number of adverse variables could negatively impact our ability to collect on the full amount of contractual consideration including circumstances where we may work in advance of customer funding. Such variables include, among others, schedule delays, including those caused by suppliers or major subcontractors, contractual disputes, failure to meet technological requirements and customer solvency concerns. These variables could lead to termination for convenience or default on our contracts which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Historically, we have experienced significant delays in the building of certain satellites. The schedule delays we from time to time experience in our satellite builds, some of which are significant, are due to a number of factors, inclusive of COVID-19 delays, subcontractor issues and technological requirements and we work closely with our customers to address these delays. We have, where appropriate, asserted force majeure provisions in our contracts but these can be subject to dispute.\n\u200b\nAny significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, and security threats could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized disclosure of data, or theft or tampering of intellectual property, any of which could materially adversely impact our business.\nOur operations, products, solutions, analysis and intellectual property are inherently at risk of loss, unauthorized access, tampering by both insider threats and external bad actors, or disruption due to inadvertent misconfiguration of our computers and networks. In particular, our operations face various cyber and other security threats, including those caused by physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, malware, worms, attacks by hackers or foreign \n22\n\n\nTable of Contents\ngovernments, disruptions from unauthorized access and tampering, including through social engineering such as phishing attacks, coordinated denial-of-service attacks and similar incidents. These cyber and other security threats could result in attempts to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, intellectual property, mission operations and networks. Our systems (internal, customer and partner systems) and assets may also be subject to damage or interruption from natural and other disaster events or disruptions including tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires, water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, epidemics or pandemics, acts of domestic or foreign terrorism, workplace violence, power shortages and blackouts, aging infrastructures and telecommunications failures. In addition, threats to the safety of our directors and employees, threats to the security of our facilities, infrastructure and supply chain, or the release of misleading or deceptive information by criminal, terrorist, or other bad actors, could have a material adverse impact on our business.\n\u200b\nOur products, solutions and analysis that we develop or deliver to our customers are also at risk of disruption, loss, or tampering. The integrity of the data (e.g., pixels), information, and analysis in our products and services is at risk of being manipulated either before or after delivery to a customer. Our products with derived information characteristics are also at risk of being incorrect due to errors of deceptive practices by others.\n\u200b\nOur customers and partners (including our supply chain and joint ventures) face similar threats. Customer or partner proprietary, classified, or sensitive information stored on our networks is at risk. Assets and intellectual property and products in customer or partner environments are also inherently at risk. We also have risk where we have access to customer and partner networks and face risks of breach, disruption or loss as well. Our supply chain for products and services also is becoming more diverse and therefore the risk is growing.\n\u200b\nWe have implemented certain systems and processes to help thwart bad actors and protect our data and our systems and assets. The techniques used to gain unauthorized access are constantly evolving, however, and we may be unable to prevent or mitigate all unauthorized access, disruption, loss, or harm. Because of our highly desired intellectual property and our support of the U.S. government and other governments, we (and/or partners we use) may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks by advanced, persistent and highly organized adversaries, including nation states and hostile foreign governments. From time to time, we have experienced attacks on our systems from bad actors that, to date, have not had a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot offer assurances, however, that future attacks will not materially adversely affect our business.\n\u200b\nA security event or other significant disruption of our systems, assets, products or solutions could:\n\u25cf\ndisrupt the proper functioning of our networks, applications and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers, or partners;\n\u25cf\nresult in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, our or our customers\u2019 proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information, including trade secrets, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes;\n\u25cf\ndestroy or degrade assets including space, ground and intellectual property assets;\n\u25cf\nmanipulate or tamper with our products, solutions, analysis, or other systems delivered to our customers or partners;\n\u25cf\ncompromise other sensitive government functions; and\n\u25cf\ndamage our reputation with our customers (particularly agencies of various governments) and the public generally.\n\u200b\nA security event that involves classified or other sensitive government information or certain controlled technical information, could subject us to civil or criminal penalties and could result in loss of our secure facility clearance and other accreditations, loss of our government contracts, loss of access to classified information, loss of export privileges or debarment as a government contractor. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand the number of web-based products and services we offer as well as increase the number of countries within which we do business.\n\u200b\n23\n\n\nTable of Contents\nSatellites are subject to construction and launch delays, launch failures\n, \ndamage or destruction during launch, the\u00a0occurrence of which can materially and adversely affect our operations.\nDelays in the construction of satellites and the procurement of requisite components and launch vehicles, limited availability of appropriate launch windows, possible delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, satellite damage or destruction during launch, launch failures, or incorrect orbital placement could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The loss of, or damage to, a satellite due to a launch failure could result in significant delays in anticipated revenue to be generated by that satellite. Any significant delay in the commencement of service of a satellite would delay or potentially permanently reduce the revenue anticipated to be generated by that satellite. In addition, if the loss of a satellite were to occur, such as with our loss of WorldView-4, we may not be able to accommodate affected customers with our other satellites or data from another source until a replacement satellite is available, and we may not have on hand, or be able to obtain in a timely manner, the necessary funds to cover the cost of any necessary satellite replacement. We may also dispute with customers the extent and consequences of any loss or delay. Any\u00a0launch delay, launch failure, underperformance, delay or perceived delay could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business prospects and financial condition.\n\u200b\nIf our satellites fail to operate as intended, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe manufacturing, testing, launching and operation of satellites involves complex processes and technology. Our satellites employ advanced technologies and sensors that are exposed to severe environmental stresses in space that have and could affect the performance of our satellites. Hardware component problems in space could lead to deterioration in performance or loss of functionality of a satellite. In addition, human operators may execute improper implementation commands that may negatively impact a satellite\u2019s performance. Exposure of our satellites to an unanticipated catastrophic event, such as a meteor shower or a collision with space debris, could reduce the performance of, or completely destroy, the affected satellite. In December 2018, our WorldView-4 satellite experienced a failure in its control moment gyros, preventing the satellite from collecting imagery.\n\u200b\nWe cannot provide assurances that our satellites will continue to operate successfully in space throughout their expected operational lives. Even if a satellite is operated properly, technical flaws in that satellite\u2019s sensors or other technical deficiencies or anomalies could significantly hinder its performance, which could materially affect our ability to collect imagery and market our products and services successfully. While some anomalies are covered by insurance policies, others are not or may not be covered, or may be subject to large deductibles.\n\u200b\nIf we suffer a partial or total loss of a deployed satellite, such as the failure of WorldView-4, we would need a significant amount of time and would incur substantial expense to replace that satellite. We may experience other problems with our satellites that may reduce their performance. During any period of time in which a satellite is not fully operational, we may lose most or all of the revenue that otherwise would have been derived from that satellite. Our inability to repair or replace a defective satellite or correct any other technical problem in a timely manner could result in a significant loss of revenue. If a satellite experiences a significant anomaly such that it becomes impaired or is no longer functional, it would significantly impact our business, prospects and profitability. Additionally, our review of satellite lives could extend or shorten the depreciable lives of our satellites, which would have an impact on the depreciation we recognize.\n\u200b\nLoss of, or damage to, a satellite and the failure to obtain data or alternate sources of data for our products may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn the Earth Intelligence segment, we rely on data collected from a number of sources including data obtained from satellites. We may become unable or limited in our ability to collect such data. For example, satellites can temporarily go out of service and be recovered, or cease to function for reasons beyond our control, including the quality of design and construction, the supply of fuel, the expected gradual environmental degradation of solar panels, the durability of various satellite components and the orbits and space environments in which the satellites are placed and operated. Electrostatic storms, collisions with other objects or actions by malicious actors, including cyber related, could also damage the satellites. Our satellites may be subject to an increased risk of collision with other space objects due to growth in the number of commercial and government satellites, along with potential adversarial actions that may create more space \n24\n\n\nTable of Contents\ndebris. Additionally, in certain instances, governments may discontinue for periods of time the access to or operation of a satellite for any particular area on the Earth and for various reasons may not permit transmission of certain data, whether from a satellite owned by the government or not.\n\u200b\nWe cannot offer assurances that each of our satellites will remain in operation. Our satellites have certain redundant systems which can fail partially or in their entirety and accordingly satellites may operate for extended periods without all redundant systems in operation, but with single points of failure. The failure of satellite components could cause damage to or loss of the use of a satellite before the end of its expected operational life. Certain of our satellites are nearing the end of their expected operational lives and we can offer no assurance that our satellites will maintain their prescribed orbits or remain operational and we may not have replacement satellites that are immediately available.\n\u200b\nInterruption or failure of our infrastructure or national infrastructure could hurt our ability to effectively perform our daily operations and provide and produce our products and services, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results.\nWe are vulnerable to natural disasters and significant disruptions including tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires, water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, epidemics or pandemics, acts of domestic or foreign terrorism, workplace violence, power shortages and blackouts, aging infrastructures and telecommunications failures. Furthermore, climate change has increased, and may continue to increase, the rate, size and scope of these natural disasters. In the event of such a natural disaster or other disruption, we could experience: disruptions to our operations or the operations of suppliers, subcontractors, distributors or customers; destruction of facilities; and/or loss of life.\n\u200b\nThe availability of many of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of our satellite operations infrastructure, satellite manufacturing operations, information technology, communications systems and national infrastructure. Any downtime, damage to or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our service, which could reduce our revenue and profits. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from floods, fires, power loss, aging infrastructure, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks or other attempts to harm our systems. We do not currently maintain a fully comprehensive back-up production facility from which we can continue to collect, process and deliver imagery in the event of the loss of our primary facility. In the event we are unable to collect, process and deliver imagery from our facility, our daily operations and operating results would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our ground terminal centers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, intentional bad acts, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, war, terrorist attacks, power losses, hardware failures, systems failures, aging infrastructure, telecommunications failures and similar events. Our satellite manufacturing operations are located in California in proximity to the San Andreas fault line, one of the longest and most heavily populated earthquake-prone rifts in the world. Our satellite manufacturing facilities are also subject to risks associated with an aging infrastructure. An infrastructure failure could result in the destruction of satellites under construction or inventory, manufacturing delays or additional costs incurred. We do not maintain back-up manufacturing facilities or operations. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in lengthy interruptions in our services and/or damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u200b\nOur business with various governmental entities is concentrated in a small number of primary contracts. The loss or\u00a0reduction in scope of any one of our primary contracts would materially reduce our revenue.\nOur business with various governmental entities is concentrated in a small number of primary contracts. We recognize significant revenue from U.S. government agencies and a significant amount of our U.S. government revenue is currently generated from a single contract, the EnhancedView Contract. The EnhancedView Contract is a service level agreement to provide image-tasking capacity on our satellites, and other imagery-derived products and services to the U.S. government. Our ability to service other customers could be negatively impacted if we are unable to maintain our current collection capacity. In addition, any inability on our part to meet the performance requirements of the EnhancedView Contract, or replacement contract, could result in a performance penalty or breach of that contract. A breach of our contract with government customers or reduction in service to our other customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The U.S. government may also terminate or suspend our contracts, including the EnhancedView Contract, at any time with or without cause. In November 2021, the \n25\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNRO announced the release of the EOCL contract RFP. The EOCL contract is expected to replace the existing EnhancedView Contract. In December 2021, we submitted our response to the EOCL RFP and we anticipate the NRO to award EOCL contracts prior to the expiration of the EnhancedView Contract, including remaining option years. Any changes in the size, scope or term of the EnhancedView Contract, or any award we receive for the EOCL Contract, could impact our satellite replenishment strategy and our ability to repay or refinance our long-term debt. Although our contracts generally involve fixed annual minimum commitments, such commitments, along with all other contracts with the U.S. government, are subject to annual Congressional appropriations and the federal budget process, and as a result, the U.S. government may not continue to fund these contracts at current or anticipated levels. Similarly, our contracts in other jurisdictions are also subject to government procurement policies and procedures.\n\u200b\nWe face competition that may cause us to have to either reduce our prices for imagery and related services or to lose market share.\nOur services compete with satellite and aerial imagery and related services offered by a range of private and government providers. Our current or future competitors may have superior technologies or greater financial, personnel and other resources than we have. The value of our imagery may also be diluted by Earth imagery that is available free of charge.\n\u200b\nThe U.S. government and foreign governments may develop, construct, launch and operate their own imagery satellites, which could reduce their need to rely on us and other commercial suppliers. In addition, such governments could sell or provide free of charge Earth imagery from their satellites and thereby compete with our imagery and related services. Also, governments may at times make our imagery freely available for humanitarian purposes, which could impair our revenue growth with non-governmental organizations. These governments could also subsidize the development, launch and operation of imagery satellites by our current or future competitors.\n\u200b\nOur competitors or potential competitors could, in the future, offer satellite-based imagery or other services with more attractive features than our services. The emergence of new remote imaging technologies or the continued growth of low-cost imaging satellites, could negatively affect our marketing efforts. More importantly, if competitors develop and launch satellites or other imagery-content sources with more advanced capabilities and technologies than ours, or offer services at lower prices than ours, our business and results of operations could be harmed. Due to competitive pricing pressures, such as new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors, the selling price of our services may further decrease. If we are unable to offset decreases in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes or by adjusting our service mix, our revenue and operating margins may decline and our financial position may be harmed.\n\u200b\nWe operate in highly competitive industries and in various jurisdictions across the world, which may cause us to have to reduce our prices.\nWe operate in highly competitive industries and many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than we have. Our primary competitors for satellite manufacturing contracts include the Boeing Company, Lockheed Martin Corporation and Northrop Grumman Corporation in the United States and Thales S.A. and Airbus Defence and Space, a subsidiary of the Airbus Group, in Europe. We may also face competition in the future from more emerging low-cost competitors, some of which could be subsidized or well-funded. Competition in our Earth Intelligence segment is highly diverse, and while our competitors offer different products, there is often competition for contracts that are part of governmental budgets. Our major existing and potential competitors for our Earth Intelligence segment include commercial satellite imagery companies, state-owned imagery providers, aerial imagery companies, free sources of imagery and unmanned aerial vehicles. Our Earth Intelligence segment faces competition from companies that provide geospatial analytic information and services to the U.S. government, including defense prime contractors such as L3Harris and Booz Allen Hamilton.\n\u200b\nIn addition, some of our foreign competitors currently benefit from, and others may benefit in the future from, protective measures by their home countries where governments are providing financial support, including significant investments in the development of new technologies. Government support of this nature greatly reduces the commercial risks associated with satellite development activities for these competitors. This market environment may result in increased pressures on our pricing and other competitive factors.\n26\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u200b\nWe are a party to legal proceedings, investigations and other claims or disputes, which are costly to defend and, if\u00a0determined adversely to us, could require us to pay fines or damages, undertake remedial measures or prevent us from taking certain actions, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are, and in the future may be, a party to legal proceedings, investigations and other claims or disputes, which may relate to subjects including commercial transactions, intellectual property, securities, employee relations, or compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\n\u200b\nFor instance, in January 2019, a Maxar stockholder filed a putative class action lawsuit in the Federal District Court of Colorado, naming Maxar and members of management as defendants alleging, among other things, that our public disclosures were false or misleading in violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and seeking monetary damages. An amended consolidated complaint was filed in that case in October 2019. On September 11, 2020, the court granted in part, and denied in part, Maxar\u2019s motion to dismiss. On July 16, 2021, the Federal District Court of Colorado certified a class consisting of investors who purchased or acquired Maxar stock between May 9, 2018 and October 30, 2018, inclusive. Also, in January 2019, a Maxar stockholder resident in Canada issued a putative class action lawsuit in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice against Maxar and members of management claiming misrepresentations in our public disclosures and seeking monetary damages under Canadian securities laws. In November 2019, a second putative class action lawsuit was issued by the same Maxar stockholder resident in Canada, adding a second representative plaintiff and three additional defendants, including Maxar\u2019s auditor KPMG LLP. The action against KPMG LLP was later discontinued. The second claim expands the proposed class period and the breadth of the allegations against us. In February 2020, the January 2019 Canadian lawsuit was discontinued. In October 2019, a Maxar stockholder filed a putative class action lawsuit in California state court, naming Maxar and certain members of management and the board of directors as defendants. The lawsuit is based upon many of the same underlying factual allegations as the federal class action but asserts claims under the Securities Act of 1933. An amended complaint was filed in April 2020. In November 2020, defendants filed a demurrer to the operative complaint, and in January 2021, the court largely overruled the demurrer. On August 20, 2021, the court certified a class consisting of investors who acquired Maxar stock in exchange for DigitalGlobe stock pursuant to the Company\u2019s June 2, 2017 Registration Statement and Prospectus issued in connection with Maxar\u2019s October 2017 acquisition of DigitalGlobe. In November 2019, a purported derivative complaint was filed against Maxar, certain current and former members of management and the board of directors in the Federal District Court of Delaware, also based on the same factual allegations as the federal putative class action. On September 18, 2020, a second purported derivative case was filed in the Federal District Court of Delaware, based on the same allegations as the earlier derivative case. The two derivative cases pending in the Federal District Court of Delaware have been consolidated and are stayed. On September 15, 2021, a third purported derivative complaint was filed against Maxar, certain current and former members of management and the board of directors in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, also based on the same factual allegations as the federal class action. In November 2021, the parties stipulated to a stay of this action.\n\u200b\nThese legal proceedings could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and could harm our stock price, business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. These and other legal proceedings and investigations are inherently uncertain and we cannot predict their duration, scope, outcome or consequences. There can be no assurance that these or any such matters that have been or may in the future be brought against us will be resolved favorably. In connection with any government investigations, in the event the government takes action against us or the parties resolve or settle the matter, we may be required to pay substantial fines or civil and criminal penalties and/or be subject to equitable remedies, including disgorgement or injunctive relief. Other legal or regulatory proceedings, including lawsuits filed by private litigants, may also follow as a consequence. These matters are likely to be expensive and time-consuming to defend, settle and/or resolve and may require us to implement certain remedial measures that could prove costly or disruptive to our business and operations. They may also cause damage to our business reputation. The unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\u200b\n27\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAcquisitions or divestitures could result in adverse impacts on our operations.\nIn order to grow our business, we may acquire additional assets or companies, including for example, our recent Vricon Acquisition completed on July 1, 2020. In connection with the Vricon Acquisition or any future acquisitions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify, acquire, or obtain the required regulatory approvals, or profitably manage the additional businesses or successfully integrate any acquired businesses, products or technologies without substantial expenses, delays or other operational, regulatory, or financial problems. In addition, any acquired businesses, products or technologies may not achieve anticipated revenues and income growth.\n\u200b\nFurther, acquisitions may involve a number of additional risks, including diversion of management\u2019s attention, failure to retain key personnel, or failure to attract the necessary talent to manage organizational growth. We may become responsible for unexpected liabilities that were not discovered or disclosed in the course of due diligence in connection with historical acquisitions and any future acquisitions. Additionally, acquisitions with international operations such as the Vricon Acquisition with operations in Sweden, expose us to greater international business risks. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of an acquisition, such as revenue gains or cost reductions, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u200b\nWe may also seek to divest portions of our businesses which may no longer be aligned with our strategic initiatives and long-term objectives. Various factors could materially affect our ability to successfully do so, including the availability of buyers willing to purchase the assets on terms acceptable to us, difficulties in the separation of operations, the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns, the disruption of our business, the potential loss of key employees and the retention of uncertain contingent liabilities related to the divested business. We cannot assure that we will be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a business or product line, and any divestiture\u00a0we undertake could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u200b\nDisruptions in U.S. government operations and funding could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition.\nAny disruptions in federal government operations could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. A prolonged failure to maintain significant U.S. government operations, particularly those pertaining to our business, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. Continued uncertainty related to recent and future U.S. federal government shutdowns, the U.S. budget and/or failure of the U.S. government to enact annual appropriations, such as long-term funding under a continuing resolution, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows. Additionally, disruptions in federal government operations may negatively impact regulatory approvals and guidance that are important to our operations.\n\u200b\nChanges in U.S. government policy regarding use of commercial data or space infrastructure providers, or material delay or cancellation of certain U.S. government programs, may have a material adverse effect on our revenue and our ability to achieve our growth objectives.\nCurrent U.S. government policy encourages the U.S. government\u2019s use of commercial data and Space Infrastructure providers to support U.S. national security objectives. Under the EnhancedView Contract, our contractual counterparty acquires imagery and imagery-derived products on behalf of our customers within the U.S. government. We are considered by the U.S. government to be a commercial data provider. U.S. government policy is subject to change and any change in policy away from supporting the use of commercial data and Space Infrastructure providers to meet U.S. government imagery and Space Infrastructure needs, or any material delay or cancellation of planned U.S. government programs, including the EnhancedView Contract, could materially adversely affect our revenue and our ability to achieve our growth objectives.\n\u200b\n28\n\n\nTable of Contents\nUncertain global macro-economic and political conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results of operations are materially affected by economic and political conditions in the United States and internationally, including inflation, deflation, interest rates, availability of capital, energy and commodity prices, trade laws and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Current or potential customers may delay or decrease spending on our products and services as their business and/or budgets are impacted by economic conditions. The inability of current and potential customers to pay us for our products and services may adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.\n\u200b\nOur business involves significant risks and uncertainties that may not be covered by insurance.\nA significant portion of our business relates to designing, developing and manufacturing advanced space technology products and systems. New technologies may be untested or unproven. Failure of some of these products and services could result in extensive property damage. Accordingly, we may incur liabilities that are unique to our products and services.\n\u200b\nWe endeavor to obtain insurance coverage from established insurance carriers to cover these risks and liabilities. However, the amount of insurance coverage that we maintain may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities. Existing coverage may be canceled while we remain exposed to the risk and it is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational risks, natural hazards and liabilities.\n\u200b\nWe have historically insured satellites in our constellation to the extent that insurance was available on acceptable premiums and other terms. The insurance proceeds received in connection with a partial or total loss of the functional capacity of any of our satellites would not be sufficient to cover the replacement cost, if we choose to do so, of an equivalent high-resolution satellite. In addition, this insurance will not protect us against all losses to our satellites due to specified exclusions, deductibles and material change limitations customary in the industry and it may be difficult or impossible to insure against certain risks, including a partial deterioration in satellite performance and satellite re-entry.\n\u200b\nThe price and availability of insurance fluctuate significantly. Although we have historically been able to obtain insurance coverage for in-orbit satellites, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so in the future. We intend to maintain insurance for our operating satellites, but any determination we make as to whether to obtain insurance coverage will depend on a variety of factors, including the availability of insurance in the market, the cost of available insurance and the redundancy of our operating satellites. Insurance market conditions or factors outside our control at the time we are in the market for the required insurance, such as failure of a satellite using similar components, could cause premiums to be significantly higher than current estimates and could reduce amounts of available coverage. The cost of our insurance has been increasing and may continue to increase. Higher premiums on insurance policies will reduce our operating income by the amount of such increased premiums. If the terms of in-orbit insurance policies become less favorable than those currently available, there may be limits on the amount of coverage that we can obtain, or we may not be able to obtain insurance at all.\n\u200b\nIn addition, even though we carry business interruption insurance policies, any business interruption losses could exceed the coverage available or be excluded from our insurance policies. Any disruption of our ability to operate our business could result in a material decrease in our revenues or significant additional costs to replace, repair or insure our assets, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u200b\nWe often rely on a single vendor or a limited number of vendors to provide certain key products or services and the inability of these key vendors to meet our needs could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nHistorically, we have contracted with a single vendor or a limited number of vendors to provide certain key products or services, such as construction of satellites and launch vehicles and management of certain remote ground terminals and direct access facilities. In addition, our manufacturing operations depend on specific technologies and companies for which there may be a limited number of vendors. We are increasingly dependent upon subcontractors and suppliers which subjects our business and results of operations to risks of supplier interruption. If these vendors are unable to meet \n29\n\n\nTable of Contents\nour needs because they fail to perform adequately, are unable to match new technological requirements or opportunities, or are unable to dedicate engineering and other resources necessary to provide the services contracted for, our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. While alternative sources for these products, services and technologies may exist, we may not be able to develop these alternative sources quickly and cost-effectively, which could materially impair our ability to operate our business. Furthermore, these vendors may request changes in pricing, payment terms or other contractual obligations, which could cause us to make substantial additional investments.\n\u200b\nAdditionally, some of our suppliers\u2019 employees are represented by labor unions. Labor union actions at suppliers can also affect us. Work stoppages and instability in our relationships with labor unions could delay the production and/or development of our products, which could strain relationships with customers, cause a loss of revenues and adversely affect our operations.\n\u200b\nDisruptions in the supply of key raw materials or components and difficulties in the supplier qualification process, as well as increases in prices of raw materials, could adversely impact us.\nMany raw materials, major components and product equipment items, particularly in our Space Infrastructure segment, are procured or subcontracted on a single or sole-source basis. Although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that near-term sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future. Supply shortages related to electronic chips is an example of some of the challenges we may face with materials. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers\u2019 inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. Our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations and damage to customer relationships and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or cash flows.\n\u200b\nKey raw materials used in our operations include metals such as aluminum and titanium, which are usually procured by our suppliers who manufacture parts in accordance with our drawings. We also purchase materials such as chemicals; composites; electronic, electro-mechanical and mechanical components; subassemblies; and subsystems that are integrated with the manufactured parts for final assembly into finished products and systems. We are impacted by increases in the prices of raw materials used in production on fixed-price business.\n\u200b\nWe monitor sources of supply to attempt to assure that adequate raw materials and other supplies needed in manufacturing processes are available.\n\u200b\nAlthough we have not experienced significant difficulty in our ability to procure raw materials, components, sub-assemblies and other supplies required in our manufacturing processes, prolonged disruptions in the supply of any of our key raw materials or components, difficulty completing qualification of new sources of supply, implementing use of replacement materials, components or new sources of supply, or a continuing increase in the prices of raw materials, energy or components could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or cash flows.\n\u200b\nWe are dependent on resellers of our services for a portion of our revenue. If these resellers fail to market or sell our services successfully, our business could be harmed.\nThe Earth Intelligence segment has historically generated a portion of its revenue from foreign and domestic resellers. In the Earth Intelligence segment, we rely on foreign resellers and partners to market and sell the majority of our services in the international market. Our foreign resellers and partners may not have the skill or experience to develop regional commercial markets for our services, or may have competing interests that negatively affect their sales of our services. If we fail to enter into reseller agreements on a timely basis or if our resellers and partners fail to market and sell our services successfully, these failures could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u200b\n30\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe may not be successful in developing new technology and the technology we are successful in developing may not meet the needs of our customers or potential new customers.\nThe markets in which we operate are characterized by changing technology and evolving industry standards. Despite\u00a0years of experience in meeting customer systems requirements with the latest in technological solutions, we may not be successful in identifying, developing and marketing products or systems that respond to rapid technological change, evolving technical standards and systems developed by others. Our competitors may develop technology that better meets the needs of our customers. If we do not continue to develop, manufacture and market innovative technologies or applications that meet customers\u2019 requirements, sales may suffer and our business may not continue to grow in line with historical rates or at all. If we are unable to achieve sustained growth, we may be unable to execute our business strategy, expand our business or fund other liquidity needs and our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\u200b\nOur technology may violate the proprietary rights of third parties and our intellectual property may be misappropriated or infringed upon by third parties, each of which could have a negative impact on our operations.\nIf any of our technology violates proprietary rights, including copyrights and patents, third parties may assert infringement claims against us. Certain software modules and other intellectual property used by us or in our satellites, systems and products make use of or incorporate licensed software components and other licensed technology. These components are developed by third parties over whom we have no control. Any claims brought against us may result in limitations on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims. We may be required to redesign our satellites, systems or products or to obtain licenses from third parties to continue offering our satellites, systems or products without substantially re-engineering such products or systems.\n\u200b\nOur intellectual property rights may be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, infringed or required to be licensed to others. An infringement or misappropriation could harm any competitive advantage we currently derive or may derive from our proprietary rights.\n\u200b\nTo protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patent protections, copyrights, trade secrets, trademark laws, confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties and protective contractual provisions such as those contained in license agreements with consultants, subcontractors, vendors and customers. Although we apply rigorous standards, documents and processes to protect our intellectual property, there is no absolute assurance that the steps taken to protect our technology will prevent misappropriation or infringement. Litigation may be necessary to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights, our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation may be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute or defend and could result in the diversion of our time and resources. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies.\n\u200b\nThe acceptance of our imagery services may not continue and our historic growth rates should not be relied upon as\u00a0an indicator of future growth\n.\nWe cannot accurately predict the extent of the market acceptance of our services or whether there will continue to be a market for our services on terms we find acceptable. Market acceptance of our commercial high-resolution Earth imagery and related services depends on a number of factors, including the quality, scope, timeliness, sophistication, price and the availability of substitute services. Changes in the market acceptance of our offerings, or other services that utilize our imagery, failure of new markets to develop, the impact of competitive conditions, or our need to make significant investments to achieve acceptance by the market would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not continue to grow in line with historical rates or at all. If we are unable to achieve sustained growth, we may be unable to execute our business strategy, expand our business or fund other liquidity needs and our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\u200b\n31\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe are dependent on our ability to attract, train and retain employees. Our inability to do so, or the loss of key personnel, would cause serious harm to our business.\nOur success is largely dependent on the abilities and experience of our executive officers and other key personnel to oversee all aspects of our operations and to deliver on our corporate strategies. Competition for highly skilled management, technical, research and development and other personnel is intense in our industry. In order to maintain our ability to compete, we must continuously retain the services of a core group of specialists in a wide variety of disciplines. To the extent that the demand for qualified personnel exceeds supply, we could experience higher labor, recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees, or could experience difficulties in performing under contracts if our need for such employees is unmet. We may not be able to retain our current executive officers or key personnel or attract and retain additional executive officers or key personnel as needed to deliver on our corporate strategy. Furthermore, the recent volatility in our stock price may undermine the use of our equity as a retention tool and may make it more difficult to retain key personnel.\n\u200b\nChanges in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results of\u00a0operations.\nWe prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. We are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, those relating our critical accounting policies of revenue recognition, including our long-term contracts accounted for utilizing the cost-to-cost method and income taxes in addition to other estimates related to restructuring costs, recoverability of assets including customer receivables, valuation of goodwill and intangibles, contingencies and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances. These assumptions and estimates involve the exercise of judgment and discretion, which may evolve over time in light of operational experience, regulatory direction, developments in accounting principles and other factors. Actual results could differ from these estimates as a result of changes in circumstances, assumptions, policies or developments in the business, which could materially affect our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\u200b\nWe may be required to recognize impairment charges.\nLong-lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets, are tested annually for impairment in the fourth quarter or whenever there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. In the past, we have recognized significant impairment losses related to goodwill, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, inventory and orbital receivables.\n\u200b\nDisruptions to our business, unexpected significant declines in our operating results, adverse technological events or changes in the regulatory markets in which we operate, and significant declines in our stock price have resulted and may result in further impairment charges to our tangible and intangible assets. Any future impairment charges could substantially affect our reported results.\n\u200b\nPension and other postretirement benefit obligations may materially impact our earnings, stockholders\u2019 equity and cash flows from operations, and could have significant adverse impacts in future periods.\nWe maintain defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits plans for some of our employees. Potential pension contributions include discretionary contributions to improve the plans\u2019 funded status. The extent of future contributions depends heavily on market factors such as the discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. We estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect on future contributions, annual pension and other postretirement costs, the value of plan assets and our benefit obligations.\n\u200b\nSignificant changes in actual return on pension assets, discount rates and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and require cash pension contributions in future periods. Changes in discount rates and actual asset returns \n32\n\n\nTable of Contents\ndifferent than our expected asset returns can result in significant non-cash actuarial gains or losses which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim re-measurement is triggered. With regard to cash pension contributions, funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates, actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations.\n\u200b\nWe also provide other postretirement benefits to certain of our employees, consisting principally of health care, dental and life insurance for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Our estimates of future costs associated with these benefits are also subject to assumptions, including estimates of the level of medical cost increases and discount rates.\n\u200b\nFluctuations in foreign exchange rates could have a negative impact on our business.\nOur revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars for the purposes of compiling our Consolidated Financial Statements. We have in the past and may in the future, use hedging strategies to manage and minimize the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our cash flow and economic profits. There are complexities inherent in determining whether and when foreign exchange exposures will materialize, in particular given the possibility of unpredictable revenue variations arising from schedule delays and contract postponements. Furthermore, if we use hedging strategies in the future, we could be exposed to the risk of non-performance of our hedging counterparties. We may also have difficulty with our hedging strategy in the future depending on the willingness of hedging counterparties to extend credit. Accordingly, no assurances may be given that our exchange rate hedging strategy would protect us from significant changes or fluctuations in revenues and expenses denominated in U.S. dollars.\n\u200b\nOur restructuring activities and cost saving initiatives may not achieve the results we anticipate.\nWe have previously and may in the future undertake cost reduction initiatives and organizational restructurings to improve operating efficiencies, optimize our asset base and generate cost savings. We cannot be certain that these initiatives have been or will be completed as planned or without business interruption, that these initiatives will not generate additional costs, such as severance or other charges, or that the estimated operating efficiencies or cost savings from such activities will be fully realized or maintained over time.\n\u200b\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Our Common Stock\n\u200b\nOur business is capital intensive, and we may not be able to raise adequate capital to finance our business strategies, including funding future satellites, or we may be able to do so only on terms that significantly restrict our ability to operate our business.\nThe implementation of our business strategies, such as expanding our satellite constellation and our products and services offerings, requires a substantial outlay of capital. As we pursue our business strategies and seek to respond to opportunities and trends in our industry, our actual capital expenditures may differ from our expected capital expenditures, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy our capital requirements in the future. We are highly leveraged, but we currently expect that our ongoing liquidity requirements for sustaining our operations will be satisfied by cash on hand and cash generated from our existing and future operations supplemented, where necessary, by available credit. However, we cannot provide assurances that our businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future or that additional capital will be available in amounts sufficient to enable us to execute our business strategies. Our ability to increase our debt financing and/or renew existing credit facilities may be limited by our existing financial and non-financial covenants, credit objectives, or the conditions of the debt capital market generally. Furthermore, our current financing arrangements contain certain restrictive financial and non-financial covenants (e.g., the achievement or maintenance of stated financial ratios) that may impact our access to those facilities and significantly limit future operating and financial flexibility.\n\u200b\n33\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing or government grants to finance operating working capital requirements and growth initiatives may be limited or difficult to obtain, which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nWe need capital to finance operating working capital requirements and growth initiatives and to pay our outstanding debt obligations as they become due for payment. If the cash generated from our businesses, together with the credit available under existing bank facilities, is not sufficient to fund future capital requirements, we will require additional debt or equity financing. Our ability to access capital markets on terms that are acceptable to us will be dependent on prevailing market conditions, as well as our future financial condition. Further, our ability to increase our debt financing and/or renew existing facilities may be limited by our existing leverage, financial and non-financial covenants, credit objectives and debt capital market conditions.\n\u200b\nWe have in the past, and may continue in the future to, receive government grants for research and development activities and other business initiatives. Any agreement or grant of this nature with government may be accompanied by contractual obligations applicable to us, which may result in the grant money becoming repayable if certain requirements are not met. A failure to meet contractual obligations under such agreements and grants and a consequent requirement to repay money received could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\n\u200b\nOur indebtedness and other contractual obligations could adversely affect our financial condition, our\u00a0ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, our ability to operate our business, our ability to react to\u00a0changes in the economy or our industry and our ability to pay our debts and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness and leverage. Our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of, interest on, or other amounts due with respect to our indebtedness. Our long-term debt under our Syndicated Credit Facility bears interest at floating rates related to \nU.S. LIBOR (for U.S. dollar borrowings), \nplus a margin. As a result, our interest payment obligations on such indebtedness will increase if such interest rates increase to the extent these changes are not mitigated by our interest rate swaps. Our leverage and debt service obligations could adversely impact our business, including by:\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nimpairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratios contained in our credit facilities or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal, including periodic principal payments;\n\u25cf\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u25cf\nrequiring the dedication of a portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, dividends to stockholders or to pursue future business opportunities;\n\u25cf\nrequiring us to sell debt or equity securities or to sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet payment obligations;\n\u25cf\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we compete; and\n\u25cf\nplacing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources.\n\u200b\nAny of the forgoing factors could have negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operation.\n\u200b\nOur current financing arrangements contain certain restrictive covenants that impact our future operating and financial flexibility.\nOur current financing arrangements contain certain restrictive covenants that may impact our future operating and financial flexibility. Our debt funding is provided under our financing agreements, which contains a series of positive and negative covenants with which we must comply, including financial and non-financial covenants. If we fail to comply with any covenants and are unable to obtain a waiver or other cure thereof, the lenders under the Syndicated Credit Facility or the holders of the 2023 Notes or 2027 Notes may be able to take certain actions with respect to the \n34\n\n\nTable of Contents\namounts owing under such agreements or notes, as applicable, including requiring early payment thereof. Any such actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. These covenants could also have the effect of limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we compete.\n\u200b\nOur actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.\nFrom time to time, we release guidance regarding our future performance that represents our management\u2019s estimates as of the date of release. This guidance, which consists of forward-looking statements, is prepared by our management and is qualified by, and subject to, the assumptions and the other information contained or referred to in the release. Our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither any independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles, examines or reviews the guidance and, accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.\n\u200b\nGuidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, is inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. We generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of these ranges. The principal reason that we release this data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons.\n\u200b\nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results, particularly any guidance relating to the results of operations of acquired businesses or companies as our management will be less familiar with their business, procedures and operations. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results will vary from the guidance and the variations may be material. Investors should also recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data will diminish the farther in the future that the data are forecast. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it.\n\u200b\nAny failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could result in the actual operating results being different than the guidance, and such differences may be adverse and material.\n\u200b\nWe could be adversely impacted by actions of activist stockholders, and such activism could impact the value of\u00a0our\u00a0securities.\nWe value constructive input from our stockholders and the investment community. However, there is no assurance that the actions taken by our Board of Directors and management in seeking to maintain constructive engagement with our stockholders will be successful. Certain of our stockholders have expressed views with respect to the operation of our business, our business strategy, corporate governance considerations or other matters. Responding to actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees. The perceived uncertainties as to our future direction due to activist actions could affect the market price of our stock, result in the loss of potential business opportunities and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, board members and business partners.\n\u200b\n35\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe price of our common stock has been volatile and may fluctuate substantially.\nOur common stock is listed on the NYSE and the TSX and the price for our common stock has historically been volatile. The market price of our common stock may continue to be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to the following factors (in addition to the other risk factors described in this section):\n\u200b\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in our operating results;\n\u25cf\nvariance in our financial performance from the expectations of equity and/or debt research analysts;\n\u25cf\ntechniques employed by short sellers to drive down the market price of our common stock;\n\u25cf\nconditions and trends in the markets we serve;\n\u25cf\nadditions of or changes to key employees;\n\u25cf\nchanges in market valuations or earnings of our competitors;\n\u25cf\ntrading volumes of our common stock;\n\u25cf\nfuture sales of our equity securities and/or future issuances of indebtedness;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the estimation of the future sizes and growth rates of our markets; and\n\u25cf\nlegislation or regulatory policies, practices or actions.\n\u200b\nIn addition, the stock markets in general have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have at times been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. Technical factors in the public trading market for our common stock may produce price movements that may or may not comport with macro, industry or company-specific fundamentals, including, without limitation, the sentiment of retail investors (including as may be expressed on financial trading and other social media sites), the amount and status of short interest in our common stock, access to margin debt and trading in options and other derivatives on our common stock. These market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock irrespective of our operating performance.\n\u200b\nA significant or prolonged decrease in our market capitalization, including a decline in stock price, or a negative long-term performance outlook, could result in an impairment of our assets which results when the carrying value of our assets exceed their fair value.\n\u200b\nIn the past several years, our securities have been the subject of short selling. Reports and information have been published about us that we believe are mischaracterized or incorrect, and which have in the past been followed by a decline in our stock price. If there are short seller allegations in the future, we may have to expend a significant amount of resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend ourselves.\n\u200b\nIn addition, in the first quarter of 2019, we became subject to certain securities class action litigation as a result of volatility in the price of our common stock, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and could harm our stock price, business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. See Part I, Item 3, \u201c\nLegal Proceedings\n\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\u200b\nUncertainty with respect to the cessation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) at the end of 2021 could impact our cost of borrowing and interest rate risk.\nWe have outstanding debt\n \nand interest rate swaps with variable interest rates using LIBOR as a factor to determine the interest rates. In July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit\u00a0LIBOR\u00a0rates after 2021. In addition, on March 5, 2021, the ICE Benchmark Administration confirmed its intention to cease publication of (i) one week and two month USD LIBOR settings after December 31, 2021 and (ii) the remaining USD LIBOR settings after June 30, 2023. It is unclear if at that time whether or not\u00a0LIBOR\u00a0will cease. Recent proposals for alternative overnight and term rates may result in the establishment of new methods of calculating one or more alternative benchmark rates.\n\u200b\n36\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn the United States, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (\"ARRC\"), a group of diverse private-market participants assembled by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has begun publishing a Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), and has proposed a paced market transition to SOFR from LIBOR. SOFR\u00a0is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities in the repurchase agreement market. Since the initial publication of SOFR, daily changes in the rate have, on occasion, been more volatile than daily changes in comparable benchmark or market rates, and SOFR over time may bear little or no relation to the historical actual or historical indicative data. At this time, it is not possible to predict how markets will respond to SOFR or the effect of any changes to LIBOR or the discontinuation of LIBOR.\n\u200b\nThe cessation of LIBOR, including the exact timing of its cessation, as well as its transition to another benchmark rate, or rates, could have adverse impacts on our outstanding interest rate swaps maturing in 2022 and 2023 and our Syndicated Credit Facility maturing in 2023 and 2024. This change may necessitate updates to our swaps and Syndicated Credit Facility, and ultimately, adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For example, if future rates based upon a successor reference rate such as SOFR (or a new method of calculating LIBOR) are higher or more volatile than LIBOR rates as currently determined or if our lenders have increased costs due to changes in LIBOR, we may experience increases in interest rates on our variable rate debt, which could adversely impact our interest expense, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u200b\nIf securities or industry analysts discontinue publishing research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our market and our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\n\u200b\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may impede or discourage a takeover, changes in management or changes in the Board of Directors, which could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nCertain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may delay or prevent a third-party from acquiring control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. These provisions include:\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u25cf\nthe exclusive right of the Board of Directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on the Board of Directors;\n\u25cf\nthe ability of the Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u25cf\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of stockholders;\n\u25cf\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the Board of Directors or two or more stockholders who hold, in the aggregate, at least ten percent (10%) of the voting power of our outstanding shares, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u25cf\na supermajority vote of our stockholders to amend our amended and restated bylaws and certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation; and\n\u25cf\nadvance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to the Board of Directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a \n37\n\n\nTable of Contents\npotential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our business.\n\u200b\nThese provisions could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\n\u200b\nIn addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in our name, actions against our directors, officers and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware (the \u201cDelaware Exclusive Forum Provision\u201d). Our amended and restated bylaws further provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cFederal Forum Provision\u201d).\n\u200b\nThe Delaware Exclusive Forum Provision is intended to apply to claims arising under Delaware state law and would not apply to claims brought pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. In addition, the Federal Forum Provision is intended to apply to claims arising under the Securities Act and would not apply to claims brought pursuant to the Exchange Act. These exclusive forum provisions will not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder and, accordingly, actions by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder must be brought in federal courts.\n\u200b\nThese exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholders\u2019 ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with the company or its directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against the Company and its directors, officers and other employees. In addition, stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware pursuant to the Delaware Exclusive Forum Provision could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Delaware. The court in the designated forum under our exclusive forum provisions may also reach different judgments on results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to the Company than to our stockholders. Further, the enforceability of similar exclusive forum provisions in other companies\u2019 organizational documents has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find any of our exclusive forum provisions to be inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings. If a court were to find all or any part of our exclusive forum provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we might incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.\n\u200b\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock.\nOur Board of Directors significantly reduced our dividends in the first quarter of 2019. Although our Board of Directors has historically declared a quarterly cash dividend which we have paid, the payment of future dividends is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and we may not pay quarterly dividends in the same amounts or at all in the future. The declaration, amount and timing of cash dividends are subject to capital availability and determinations by our Board of Directors that such dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and applicable agreements. Our ability to pay dividends will depend upon, among other factors, our cash balances and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions, debt service requirements, results of operations, financial condition and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. The elimination of our dividend payments and/or our dividend program could have a negative effect on our stock price.\n\u200b\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nOur operations in the U.S. government market are subject to significant regulatory risk.\nOur operations in the U.S. government market are subject to significant government regulation. A failure by us to maintain the relevant clearances and approvals could limit our ability to operate in the U.S. market. Further, there can be \n38\n\n\nTable of Contents\nno assurance that we will continue to be awarded contracts by the U.S. government. In addition, a failure by us to keep current and compliant with relevant U.S. regulations could result in fines, penalties, repayments, or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time and could have an adverse effect on our standing and eligibility for future U.S. government contracts.\n\u200b\nFailure to comply with the requirements of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual could result in interruption, delay or suspension of our ability to provide our products and services, and could result in loss of current and future business with the U.S. government.\nWe and our subsidiaries are parties to certain contracts with various departments and agencies of the U.S. government, including the U.S. Department of Defense, which require that certain of our legal entities be issued facility security clearances under the National Industrial Security Program. The National Industrial Security Program requires that a corporation maintaining a facility security clearance be effectively insulated from foreign ownership, control or influence (\u201cFOCI\u201d). Prior to the U.S. Domestication, we were incorporated under the laws of Canada, and had entered into a Security Control Agreement, dated January 26, 2017, by and among us, our wholly owned subsidiary, Maxar Technologies Holdings Inc. and the U.S. Department of Defense (\u201cSCA\u201d), as a suitable FOCI mitigation arrangement under the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual. Upon U.S. Domestication, the SCA was dissolved and we entered into a Board Resolution to mitigate remaining FOCI risks as seen by the U.S. government. Failure to maintain an agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense regarding the appropriate FOCI mitigation arrangement could result in invalidation or termination of the facility security clearances, which in turn would mean that our U.S. subsidiaries would not be able to enter into future contracts with the U.S. government requiring facility security clearances, and may result in the loss of the ability of those subsidiaries to complete existing contracts with the U.S. government.\n\u200b\nOur business is subject to various regulatory risks that could adversely affect our operations.\nThe environment in which we operate is highly regulated due to the sensitive nature of our complex and technologically advanced systems, including satellites, products, hardware and software, in addition to those regulations broadly applicable to publicly listed corporations. There are numerous regulatory risks that could adversely affect operations, including but not limited to:\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nChanges in laws and regulations\n. It is possible that the laws and regulations governing our business and operations will change in the future. A substantial portion of our revenue is generated from customers outside of the U.S. There may be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations if we are required to alter our business to comply with changes in both domestic and foreign regulations, telecommunications standards, foreign policy, tariffs or taxes and other trade barriers that reduce or restrict our ability to sell our products and services on a global basis, or by political and economic instability in the countries in which we conduct business. Any failure to comply with such regulatory requirements could also subject us to various fines, penalties or sanctions.\n\u25cf\nExport Restrictions\n. Certain of our businesses and satellites, systems, products, services or technologies we have developed require the implementation or acquisition of products or technologies from third parties, including those in other jurisdictions. In addition, certain of our satellites, systems, products or technologies may be required to be forwarded or exported to other jurisdictions. In certain cases, if the use of the technologies can be viewed by the jurisdiction in which that supplier or subcontractor resides as being subject to export constraints or restrictions relating to national security, we may not be able to obtain the technologies and products that we require from suppliers or subcontractors who would otherwise be our preferred choice or may not be able to obtain the export permits necessary to transfer or export our technology. To the extent that we are able, we obtain pre-authorization for re-export prior to signing contracts which oblige us to export subject technologies, including specific foreign government approval as needed. In the event of export restrictions, we may have the ability through contract force majeure provisions to be excused from our obligations. Notwithstanding these provisions, the inability to obtain export approvals, export restrictions or changes during contract execution or non-compliance by our customers could have an adverse effect on our revenues and margins.\n39\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u25cf\nU.S. Government Approval Requirements\n. For certain aspects of our business operations, we are required to obtain U.S. government licenses and approvals to enter into agreements or engage in commercial transactions with various end users (including government bodies) in order to export satellites and related equipment, disclose technical data or provide defense services to foreign persons. The delayed receipt of or the failure to obtain the necessary U.S. government licenses, approvals and agreements may prohibit entry into or interrupt the completion of contracts which could lead to a customer\u2019s termination of a contract for default, monetary penalties and/or the loss of incentive payments.\n\u25cf\nCompetitive Impact of U.S. Regulations on Satellite Sales\n. Some of our customers and potential customers, along with insurance underwriters and brokers, have asserted that U.S. export control laws and regulations governing disclosures to foreign persons excessively restrict their access to information about the satellite during construction and on-orbit. Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) sanctions and requirements may also limit certain business opportunities or delay or restrict our ability to contract with potential foreign customers or operators. To the extent that our non-U.S. competitors are not subject to OFAC or similar export control or economic sanctions laws and regulations, they may enjoy a competitive advantage with foreign customers, and it could become increasingly difficult for the U.S. satellite manufacturing industry, including us, to recapture this lost market share. Customers concerned over the possibility that the U.S. government may deny the export license necessary for us to deliver their purchased satellite to them, or the restrictions or delays imposed by the U.S. government licensing requirements, even where an export license is granted, may elect to choose a satellite that is purportedly free of International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\u201cITAR\u201d) offered by a non-U.S. supplier. We are further disadvantaged by the fact that a purportedly \u201cITAR-free\u201d satellite may be launched less expensively in China on the Chinese Long March\u00a0rocket, a launch vehicle that, because of ITAR restrictions, is not available to us.\n\u25cf\nAnti-Corruption Laws\n. As part of the regulatory and legal environments in which we operate, we are subject to global anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments directly or indirectly to government officials, authorities or persons defined in those anti-corruption laws in order to obtain or retain business or other improper advantages in the conduct of business. Our policies mandate compliance with anti-corruption laws. Failure by our employees, agents, subcontractors, suppliers and/or partners to comply with anti-corruption laws could impact us in various ways that include, but are not limited to, criminal, civil and administrative fines and/or legal sanctions and the inability to bid for or enter into contracts with certain entities, all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our reputation, operations and financial results.\n\u200b\nChanges in tax law, in our tax rates or in exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments may materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u200b\nChanges in law and policy relating to taxes, including those with retroactive effect, may materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, the Administration and Congress could make changes to existing tax law, such as increasing the corporate tax rate and enacting a minimum tax on worldwide book income. We continue to monitor tax law developments and assess the impact on the Company.\n\u200b\nThe U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\u201c2017 Tax Act\u201d) on December 22, 2017, which significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations. The 2017 Tax Act remains unclear in many respects and has been, and may continue to be, the subject of amendments and technical corrections, as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the Treasury and IRS, which have mitigated or increased certain adverse impacts of the 2017 Tax Act and may continue to do so in the future.\n\u200b\nOur ability to use our U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\n\u200b\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $520 million, $874 million and $12 million of federal, state and foreign net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards and $83 million of U.S. tax credit carryforwards primarily related to research and development expenditures, net of unrecognized tax benefits.\n\u200b\n40\n\n\nTable of Contents\nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cCode\u201d), if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change U.S. federal NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs if there is a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in a corporation\u2019s equity ownership by certain stockholders over a rolling three-year period. Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply to limit our use of accumulated state tax attributes. While we do not believe that we have experienced ownership changes in the past that would materially limit our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards, the Section 382 rules are complex and there is no assurance our view is correct. In the event that we experience ownership changes in the future, our ability to use pre-change NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset post-change taxable income will be subject to limitations. As a result, we may be unable to use a material portion of our NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes, which could adversely affect our future cash flows.\n\u200b\nOur operations are subject to governmental law and regulations relating to environmental matters, which may expose us to significant costs and liabilities that could negatively impact our financial condition.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the operation of our businesses, including those governing pollution, the handling, storage, disposal and transportation of hazardous substances and the ownership and operation of real property. In addition, we could be affected by future regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change, other aspects of the environment or natural resources. We have been designated, along with other companies, as a named discharger potentially responsible for the cleanup of groundwater contamination at certain sites in California where we operate and there can be no assurance that the previous owners of those properties strictly complied with such environmental laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations may result in significant liabilities and costs to us due to the actions or inactions of the previous owners. In addition, new laws and regulations, more stringent enforcement of existing laws and regulations or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could result in additional costs.\n\u200b\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs and demands in order to comply with laws and regulations applicable to public companies.\nIn January 2019, we became a \u201cdomestic issuer\u201d for SEC reporting purposes and a reporting issuer in each of the jurisdictions in Canada in which Maxar Canada was a reporting issuer. The obligations of being a public company in the U.S. and Canada require significant expenditures and will place significant demands on our management and other personnel, including costs resulting from public company reporting obligations under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, applicable Canadian securities laws, and the rules and regulations regarding corporate governance practices, including those under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the listing requirements of the NYSE and the TSX. These rules require that we maintain effective disclosure and financial controls and procedures, internal control over financial reporting and changes in corporate governance practices, among many other complex rules that are often difficult to monitor and maintain compliance with. Additionally, new standards, as well as investor expectations are developing around environmental, social and governance matters (\u201cESG\u201d) and other emerging socioeconomic trends and matters, which require continual monitoring and compliance. Our management and other personnel will continue to devote a substantial amount of time to ensure compliance with all of these requirements and to keep pace with new regulations, otherwise we may fall out of compliance and risk becoming subject to reputational damage, litigation or being delisted, among other potential problems.\n\u200b\nOur international business exposes us to risks relating to regulation, currency fluctuations and political or economic instability in foreign markets, which could adversely affect our revenue, earnings, cash flows and our financial condition.\n\u200b\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from non-U.S. sales, and we intend to continue to pursue international contracts. International operations are subject to certain risks, such as: changes in domestic and foreign governmental regulations and licensing requirements; deterioration of relations between the U.S. and/or a particular foreign country; increases in tariffs and taxes and other trade barriers; foreign currency fluctuations; changes in political and economic stability both in the U.S. and internationally; effects of austerity programs or similar significant budget reduction \n41\n\n\nTable of Contents\nprograms; potential preferences by prospective customers to purchase from local (non-U.S.) sources; difficulties in obtaining or enforcing judgments in foreign jurisdictions; and unforeseen developments and conditions, including war, epidemics and pandemics and international tensions and conflicts.\n\u200b\nIn addition, our international contracts may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific in-country purchases, investments, manufacturing agreements or other financial obligations, known as offset obligations, and provide for penalties if we fail to meet such requirements. The impact of these factors is difficult to predict, but one or more of them could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\u200b\nExposure to United Kingdom political developments, including the effect of its withdrawal from the European Union, could be costly and difficult to comply with and could harm our business.\nIn June 2016, a referendum was passed in the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d This decision created an uncertain political and economic environment in the United Kingdom and other European Union countries. The United Kingdom formally left the European Union on January 31, 2020 and the transition period provided for in the withdrawal agreement entered by the United Kingdom and the European Union ended on December 31, 2020. In December 2020, the United Kingdom and the European Union agreed on a trade and cooperation agreement that will apply provisionally after the end of the transition period until it is ratified by the parties to the agreement. On December 31, 2020, the United Kingdom passed legislation giving effect to the trade and cooperation agreement, with the European Union formally adopting the agreement in April 2021. The trade and cooperation agreement covers the general objectives and framework of the relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union. Depending on the application of the terms of the trade and cooperation agreement, we could face new regulatory costs and challenges.\n\u200b\nOur United Kingdom operations service customers in the United Kingdom as well as in other countries in the EU, and these operations could be disrupted by Brexit. The political and economic instability created by\u00a0Brexit\u00a0has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global financial markets and uncertainty regarding the regulation of data protection in the United Kingdom. In particular, the United Kingdom enacted a Data Protection Act in May 2018 that is consistent with the EU General Data Protection Regulation. In June 2021, the European Union determined that the United Kingdom\u2019s Data Protection Act was adequate to permit the flow of certain data between the European Union and the United Kingdom without additional restrictions for a period of up to four years. This decision temporarily reduces the uncertainty surrounding how data transfers between the European Union and the United Kingdom will be regulated. Brexit\u00a0could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services, capital and people between the United Kingdom, the European Union and elsewhere including, for example, the United Kingdom\u2019s documentation requirements on goods imported from the European Union.\n\u200b", "item7": ">ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\u200b\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a provider of comprehensive space solutions and secure, precise, geospatial intelligence. We help government and commercial customers monitor, understand and navigate our changing planet; deliver global broadband communications; and explore and advance the use of space. Our approach combines decades of deep mission understanding and a proven commercial and defense foundation to deploy solutions and deliver insights with speed, scale and cost effectiveness.\n \nOur businesses are organized and managed in two reportable segments: Earth Intelligence and Space Infrastructure, as described below under \u201cSegment Results\u201d.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nCommon stock offering\nOn March\u00a022, 2021, we completed an underwritten public offering of 10 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $40 per share (\u201cOffering\u201d). We received proceeds of $380 million, net of $20 million of transaction fees. The underwriters did not exercise the option to purchase an additional 1.5 million shares of our common stock prior to the expiration of the option.\n\u200b\nOn March 26, 2021, we redeemed $350 million aggregate principal amount of our 9.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2023 (\u201c2023 Notes\u201d) using a portion of the net proceeds from the Offering. Additionally, we paid premiums of approximately $34 million related to the early redemption.\n\u200b\nCOVID-19 operational posture and current impact\n\u200b\nWe continue to monitor and adapt our pandemic crisis response plan, while maintaining a focus on the protection of the health and safety of our employees, families, customers and communities. All our locations continue to operate through a combination of work from home and personnel working on-site, though in some cases capacity utilization and productivity are below normalized levels. We are observing stress in our supplier base inside and outside the U.S. and will continue to monitor and assess the actual and potential COVID-19 impacts on employees, customers, suppliers and the productivity of the work being done, all of which to some extent will affect revenues, estimated costs to complete projects, earnings and cash flow. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021, were not materially impacted by COVID-19.\n\u200b\nChanges in our operations in response to COVID-19 and employee illnesses resulting from the pandemic have resulted in inefficiencies and delays of our projects, impacts to service level contracts, including in sales and product development efforts and additional costs related to business continuity initiatives that cannot be fully mitigated through succession planning or employees working remotely. We have delayed transition of our employees back into Maxar worksites due to increases in COVID-19 cases in the broad population. Additionally, to provide for the health and safety of our workforce and business continuity, we have implemented a Vaccination Policy which requires that Maxar employees are vaccinated for COVID-19 unless they have an approved accommodation. As of January 4, 2022, 99% of our U.S. based employees were in compliance with this policy and have either been vaccinated or received an accommodation.\n\u200b\nWorldView Legion satellites update\n\u200b\nWe continue to make progress during the test and integration phase. During January 2022, we experienced delays related to COVID-19 protocols and now, assuming no major issues arise, anticipate the first launch of the WorldView Legion satellites in the June to July, 2022 timeframe. We plan on having three launches in total and expect the second and third launches to be within three and six months, respectively, after the first launch.\n44\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u200b\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nOur Chief Operating Decision Maker measures performance of our reportable segments based on revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. Our operating and reportable segments are: Earth Intelligence and Space Infrastructure.\n\u200b\nEarth Intelligence\n\u200b\nIn the Earth Intelligence segment, we are a global leader in high-resolution space-based Earth observation imagery products and analytics. We launched the world\u2019s first high-resolution commercial imaging satellite in 1999 and currently operate a four-satellite imaging constellation, providing us with over two decades and approximately 137 petabytes of imagery over our history (referred to as our \u201cImage Library\u201d) of the highest-resolution, commercially available imagery. Our imagery solutions provide customers with timely, accurate and mission-critical information about our changing planet and support a wide variety of government and enterprise applications, including mission planning, mapping and analysis, environmental monitoring, disaster management, crop management, oil and gas exploration and infrastructure management. We continue to innovate as demands for new satellite technology and advanced analytic tools increase. We are a leader in commercial satellite imagery, and our commitment to accuracy, clarity and recency of foundational mapping enables us to provide the highest quality imagery basemaps for our customers. The high-quality satellite also enables us to provide advanced 3D modeling for augmented reality (\u201cAR\u201d), virtual reality (\u201cVR\u201d) and interactive engagement through our Precision3D Suite of tools. The U.S. government is the largest customer of our Earth Intelligence segment through the EnhancedView Contract, G-EGD and OWT programs and various classified and unclassified contract vehicles. In the commercial satellite Earth observation industry, we are a leader across U.S. government agencies, international government agencies and enterprise customer verticals.\n\u200b\nWe also provide geospatial services that combine imagery, analytic expertise and innovative technology to deliver intelligence solutions to customers. Our approximately 1,700 cleared personnel support analytic solutions that accurately document change and enable geospatial modeling and analysis that help predict where events will occur. Our primary customer of geospatial services is the U.S. government, but we also support intelligence requirements for other U.S. allied governments, global development organizations and enterprise customers.\n\u200b\nSpace Infrastructure\n\u200b\nIn the Space Infrastructure segment, we provide solutions for communications, Earth observation, remote sensing, on-orbit servicing, robotic assembly and space exploration. We address a broad spectrum of needs for our customers, including mission systems engineering, product design, spacecraft manufacturing, assembly, integration and testing. Our principal customers in the Space Infrastructure segment are commercial satellite operators and government agencies worldwide. Our approach combines proven success gained over six decades in the industry with the nimbleness and agility of a smaller space company.\n\u200b\n45\n\n\nTable of Contents\nRESULTS OF

These increases were partially offset by a $6 million decrease in transaction and integration related expenses. \n\u200b\nSelling, general and administrative costs increased to $332 million from $325 million, or by $7 million, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. \nThe increase was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $23 million. Stock-based compensation expense increased primarily due to a higher stock price. The increase was also due to an increase in labor related expenses of $16 million driven primarily by an increase in headcount and employee compensation. These increases were partially offset by a $15 million decrease in restructuring expenses, a $9 million decrease in transaction and integration related expenses and a $7 million decrease in travel related expenses driven by our COVID-19 operating posture.\n47\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u200b\nDepreciation and amortization\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nYear Ended December 31,\n\u200b\n$ Change\n\u200b\n\u200b\n% Change\n\u200b\n$ Change\n\u200b\n\u200b\n% Change\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2021\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2020\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2019\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2020 to 2021\n\u200b\n2019 to 2020\n\u200b\n($ millions)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n \n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nProperty, plant and equipment\n\u00a0\n$\n 86\n\u00a0\n$\n 93\n\u200b\n$\n 107\n\u200b\n$\n (7)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (8)\n%\n$\n (14)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (13)\n%\nIntangible assets\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n 204\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n 255\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 269\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (51)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (20)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (14)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (5)\n\u200b\nDepreciation and amortization expense\n\u00a0\n$\n 290\n\u00a0\n$\n 348\n\u200b\n$\n 376\n\u200b\n$\n (58)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (17)\n%\n$\n (28)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (7)\n%\n\u200b\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased to $290 million from $348 million, or by $58 million, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. \nThe decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in amortization expense for backlog acquired as part of the acquisition of DigitalGlobe, Inc. on October 5, 2017.

The decrease was also driven by a decrease in depreciation expense related to the extension of the useful lives of two satellites in the fourth quarter of 2020 and three satellites in the fourth quarter of 2021. These decreases were partially offset by the inclusion of a full year of depreciation and amortization expense from property, plant and equipment and intangible assets acquired as part of the Vricon Acquisition on July 1, 2020, compared to two quarters of expense in 2020.\n\u200b\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased to $348 million from $376 million, or by $28 million, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019.

We recognized a full year of amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to approximately nine months for the year ended December 31, 2020, as all of the U.S. government acquired backlog was fully amortized in October 2020. The decrease was also driven by a decrease in depreciation expense related to asset retirements made in the second half of 2019 and in the first quarter of 2020, the extension of the useful life of one satellite in the fourth quarter of 2019 and two satellites in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the sale of our owned properties in Palo Alto in December 2019.

The effect of imputing interest on these advanced payments was to increase contract liabilities with an offsetting charge to interest expense. As capacity was provided to the customer, revenue was recognized and the contract liabilities balance decreased. The remaining revenue was fully recognized as of \nAugust 31, 2020.\nInterest expense, net decreased to $151 million from $175 million, or by $24 million, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a $47 million decrease in interest on long-term debt primarily driven by lower principal balances on the 2023 Notes and Term Loan B (as defined below) due to a repurchase of a portion of the 2023 Notes in the second quarter of 2020, a partial redemption of the 2023 Notes in the first quarter of 2021 and a repayment made on Term Loan B in the second quarter of 2020. These decreases in interest on long-term debt were partially offset by an increase in interest expense following our issuance of the 2027 Notes (as defined below). There was also an increase in capitalized interest of $7 million related to the building of our \nWorldView Legion satellites\n. These decreases were partially offset by a $41 million loss on debt extinguishment from the partial redemption of our 2023 Notes using proceeds from the Offering for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a $7 million loss on debt extinguishment for 2020.\n\u200b\nInterest expense, net decreased to $175 million from $219 million, or by $44 million, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. \nThe decrease was primarily due to a $15 million increase in the loss on debt extinguishment for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2020, an increase in capitalized interest of $14 million related to the building of our WorldView Legion satellites and a $12 million decrease in interest on advance payments from customers. \nOther income, net\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nYear Ended December\u00a031,\u00a0\n\u200b\n$ Change\n\u200b\n\u200b\n% Change\n\u200b\n$ Change\n\u200b\n\u200b\n% Change\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2021\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2020\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2019\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2020 to 2021\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2019 to 2020\n\u200b\n($ millions)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n \n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nOther income, net\n\u00a0\n$\n (8)\n\u00a0\n$\n (104)\n\u200b\n$\n (1)\n\u200b\n$\n 96\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (92)\n%\n$\n (103)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n*\n%\n*\nNot meaningful.\n\u200b\nOther income, net decreased to $8 million from $104 million, or by $96 million, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020.\n The decrease was primarily driven by a gain of $85 million recorded as a result of the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in Vricon due to the Vricon Acquisition for the year ended December 31, 2020 which did not recur in 2021.

The increase was primarily driven by \na\n $48 \nmillion increase in revenue from international defense and intelligence customers, a $36 million increase in new and expanded commercial programs and a $7 million increase in revenue from new contracts with the U.S. government. These increases were \n52\n\n\nTable of Contents\npartially offset by an $80 million decrease in the recognition of deferred revenue related to the EnhancedView Contract. We recognized $80 million of deferred revenue from the EnhancedView Contract for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to none for the year ended December 31, 2021, as it was fully recognized as of August 31, 2020.\n\u200b\nRevenues from the Earth Intelligence segment revenues decreased to $1,081 million from $1,085 million, or by $4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by a $40 million decrease in the recognition of deferred revenue related to the EnhancedView Contract. We recognized $120 million of deferred revenue from the EnhancedView Contract for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $80 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as it was fully recognized as of August 31, 2020. These decreases were partially offset by a $15 million increase in revenue from new contracts with the U.S. government, an $11 million increase in revenue from international defense and intelligence customers and a $10 million increase in revenue driven by the inclusion of Vricon\u2019s revenue for two quarters in 2020 compared to none in 2019 as it was accounted for as an equity method investment. Revenue from international defense and intelligence customers increased primarily due to the usage of new direct access facilities which became operational and contracts that signed in the second half of 2019. \n\u200b\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased to $492 million from $513 million, or by $21 million, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in the recognition of deferred revenue related to the EnhancedView Contract as mentioned above. The decrease was also driven by an increase in selling, general and administrative costs due to an increase in labor related expenses driven by an increase in headcount, employee compensation and fringe benefits for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020. These decreases were partially offset by the expansion of contracts with existing commercial and international defense and intelligence customers contributing to positive program margin growth.\n\u200b\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased to $513 million from $548 million, or by $35 million, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by a $40 million decrease in the recognition of revenue related to the EnhancedView Contract and a $10 million decrease related to equity in income from our Vricon joint venture which was acquired and consolidated in our results in 2020. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenue from new contracts with the U.S. government.\n\u200b\nSpace Infrastructure\nThe following table provides selected financial information for the Space Infrastructure segment.\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nYear Ended December\u00a031,\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n$ Change\n\u200b\n% Change\n\u200b\n\u200b\n$ Change\n\u200b\n% Change\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2021\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2020\n\u200b\n2019\n\u200b\n2020 to 2021\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2019 to 2020\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n($ millions)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nTotal revenues\n\u200b\n$\n 740\n\u200b\n$\n 721\n\u200b\n$\n 706\n\u200b\n$\n 19\n\u00a0\n 3\n%\n$\n 15\n\u00a0\n 2\n%\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\u200b\n$\n 46\n\u200b\n$\n (3)\n\u200b\n$\n (17)\n\u200b\n$\n 49\n\u200b\n*\n\u200b\n$\n 14\n\u200b\n (82)\n%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n(as a % of total revenues)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 6.2\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n (0.4)\n%\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n (2.4)\n%\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n*\nNot meaningful.\n\u200b\nChanges in revenues from year to year are influenced by the size, timing and number of satellite contracts awarded in the current and preceding years and the length of the construction period for satellite contracts awarded. Revenues on satellite contracts are recognized using the cost-to-cost method to determine the percentage of completion over the construction period, which typically ranges between 20 to 36 months, and up to 48 months in certain situations. Adjusted EBITDA margins can vary from quarter to quarter due to the mix of our revenues and changes in our estimated total costs at completion (\u201cEAC\u201d) as our risks are retired and as our EACs are increased or decreased based on contract performance. Adjusted EBITDA margins are also impacted by estimated contractual consideration.\n\u200b\nRevenues from the Space Infrastructure segment increased to $740\u00a0million from $721\u00a0million, or by $19\u00a0million, for the year ended\u00a0December\u00a031, 2021, compared to 2020.\u00a0Revenues increased primarily as a result of an increase in revenues from commercial programs of $87 million due to higher volumes and lower EAC growth primarily due to no COVID-19 \n53\n\n\nTable of Contents\nprogram impacts for the year ended December 31, 2021. Revenues were negatively impacted by a $19 million decrease year over year related to our contract with Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (\u201cSirius XM\u201d). The year ended December 31, 2021, included a $30 million cumulative adjustment to revenue primarily related to the loss of final milestone and expected orbital payments from Sirius XM due to the non-performance of the SXM-7 satellite and other adjustments that were recorded in 2021. After exhausting efforts to fully recover the SXM-7 satellite and further discussions with Sirius XM, in April 2021, we made the determination to record the cumulative adjustment to revenue.\u00a0In addition, there were $3 million of costs incurred in the first quarter of 2021 related to attempts to repair and fully recover the SXM-7 satellite. The aggregate impact for the year ended December 30, 2021, was $33 million. The $33 million decrease was partially offset by the non-reoccurrence of a $14 million adjustment to revenue due to the identification of a design anomaly on the commercial satellite program, which was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, the total increase in revenues from the Space Infrastructure segment was partially offset by a $49 million decrease in revenues from U.S. government contracts.\n\u200b\nRevenues from the Space Infrastructure segment increased to $721 million from $706 million, or by $15 million, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared 2019. Revenues increased primarily as a result of an increase in volume related to U.S. government contracts of $137 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. This increase in revenue was partially offset by the impact of reduced volumes on commercial programs of $\n122\n million including a $9 million impact due to increases in estimated costs and an associated change in the EAC profit margin of a commercial satellite program due to the identification of a design anomaly in the final stage of a testing process. Revenues were also negatively impacted by $27 million of estimated COVID-19 related EAC growth during the period and are included in the above-mentioned results. The increases in the EACs are due to increases in estimated program costs associated with the COVID-19 operating posture and the estimated impact of certain items such as supplier delays and increased labor hours. These costs are considered incremental and separable from normal operations.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased to $46 million from a loss of $3 million, or by $49 million, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020. \nThe increase in the Space Infrastructure segment was primarily related to a $92 million increase driven by increased volumes on commercial programs which resulted in increased margins and fewer negative EAC impacts during the year as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, which included negative EAC impacts due to COVID-19. The increase in commercial program margins has been driven by a change in program mix related to the completion of less profitable programs offset by new, more profitable programs. These increases were partially offset by the $19 million reduction in revenue related to the above-mentioned SXM-7 satellite impacts and a $19 million increase in indirect costs and selling, general and administrative costs which was primarily driven by an $11 million increase in research and development expenses.\n\u200b\nAdjusted EBITDA was a loss of $3 million compared to a loss of $17 million, or an increase of $14 million, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019. The increase in the Space Infrastructure segment is primarily related to higher margins and favorable EACs outside of the estimated COVID-19 impacts discussed below, on commercial programs of $68 million. This has been driven by a change in program mix related to the completion of less profitable programs offset by new, more profitable programs along with $8 million less of program losses on a developmental program for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. The increase in commercial programs are partially offset by an estimated $27 million negative impact related to our COVID-19 operating posture. The increase is also partially offset by a $16 million increase in costs due to a change in the compensation structure from retention payments to bonuses which were not included in segment Adjusted EBITDA in 2019, a $9 million negative impact on the above-mentioned commercial satellite program with a design anomaly and a recovery of a previously reserved amount of $7 million in 2019 which did not reoccur in 2020. \nThe remainder of the change was related to a decrease in cost of product and services and selling, general and administrative expenses.\nCorporate and other expenses\n\u200b\nCorporate and other expenses include items such as corporate office costs, regulatory costs, executive and director compensation, foreign exchange gains and losses, retention costs and fees for legal and consulting services. \n54\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCorporate and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased to $89 million from $61 million, or by $28 million, compared to 2020. \nThe increase was primarily driven by a $14 million increase in selling, general and administrative costs primarily due to an increase in labor related expenses \ndriven by an increase in employee compensation and fringe benefits. There was also an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $5 million primarily due to a higher fair market value of equity awards granted. The increase was also driven by a $3 million foreign exchange loss for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a $5 million foreign exchange gain for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nCorporate and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased to $61 million from $86 million, or by $25 million, compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by a $24 million decrease in retention costs related to a 2019 program within the Space Infrastructure segment. The decrease was also driven by a $5 million foreign exchange gain for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a $2 million foreign exchange loss for the year ended December 31, 2019. These decreases were partially offset by a $13 million increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily driven by a higher stock price.\nIntersegment eliminations\nIntersegment eliminations are related to projects between our segments, primarily WorldView Legion. Intersegment eliminations decreased for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020, primarily related to a decrease in satellite construction activity. \nIntersegment eliminations decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019, primarily related to a decrease in satellite construction activity. \nBACKLOG\nOur backlog by segment from continuing operations is as follows:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nDecember\u00a031,\u00a0\n\u200b\nDecember\u00a031,\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n2021\n\u200b\n2020\n($ millions)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nEarth Intelligence\n\u200b\n$\n 1,028\n\u200b\n$\n 880\nSpace Infrastructure\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 865\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 1,024\nTotal backlog\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 1,893\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 1,904\nUnfunded contract options\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 650\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 856\nTotal\n\u200b\n$\n 2,543\n\u200b\n$\n 2,760\n\u200b\nOrder backlog, representing the estimated dollar value of firm contracts for which work has not yet been performed (also known as the remaining performance obligations on a contract), was $1,893 million as of December 31, 2021 compared to $1,904 million as of December 31, 2020. Order backlog generally does not include unexercised contract options and potential orders under indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts. Approximately 66% of the total $1,893 million backlog as of December 31, 2021 is expected to be converted into revenue in 2022.\n\u200b\nBacklog in the Space Infrastructure segment is primarily comprised of multi-year awards, such as satellite builds. Fluctuations in backlog are driven primarily by the timing of large program wins. Backlog in the Earth Intelligence segment consists of both multi-year and annual contracts, which renew at various times throughout the year. As a result, the timing of when contracts are awarded and when option years are exercised may cause backlog to fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nAlthough backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm, terminations, amendments or cancellations may occur, which could result in a reduction in our total backlog.\n\u200b\nOur unfunded contract options totaled $650 million and $856 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Unfunded contract options represent estimated amounts of revenue to be earned in the future from negotiated contracts \n55\n\n\nTable of Contents\nwith unexercised contract options and indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts. Unfunded contract options as of December 31, 2021 were primarily comprised of the option year in the EnhancedView Contract (September 1, 2022 through July 12, 2023) and other U.S. government and commercial customer contracts. In November 2021, the National Reconnaissance Office (\u201cNRO\u201d) announced the release of the Electro-Optical Commercial Layer (\u201cEOCL\u201d) contract Request for Proposal (\u201cRFP\u201d) which is expected to replace the existing EnhancedView Contract. In December 2021, we submitted our response to the EOCL RFP and anticipate the NRO to award EOCL contracts prior to the expiration of the EnhancedView Contract, including remaining option years. \n\u200b\nLIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur sources of liquidity include cash provided by operations, access to existing credit facilities, collection or securitization of orbital receivables and, when available and efficient, access to the capital markets. We generally maintain limited cash on hand and use available cash to pay down borrowings on our Syndicated Credit Facility (as defined below). Our primary short-term cash requirements are to fund working capital, including requirements on long-term construction contracts (including our geostationary satellite contracts), fixed overhead costs and to fund increased capital expenditures, including the construction of our WorldView Legion satellites. Working capital requirements can vary significantly from period to period, particularly as a result of the timing of receipts and disbursements related to long-term construction contracts. \nOur medium-term to long-term cash requirements are to service and repay debt and make investments, including in facilities, equipment, technologies and research and development for growth initiatives. These capital investments include investments to replace the capability or capacity of satellites which have or will go out of service in the future. Over the near-term to medium-term, it is also possible that our customers may fully or partially fund the construction of additional Legion satellites. Cash is also used to pay dividends and finance other long-term strategic business initiatives. \nOur first maturity of long-term debt is in the fourth quarter of 2023 and relates to the 2023 Notes and Revolving Credit Facility. We had a significant partial debt redemption of the 2023 Notes in the first quarter of 2021 using proceeds from our Offering. On March 26, 2021, we redeemed $350 million aggregate principal amount of our 2023 Notes using a portion of the net proceeds from the Offering. \n\u200b\nWe have significant purchase obligations in the normal course of business for goods and services, under agreements with defined terms as to quantity, price and timing of delivery. \nPurchase obligations represent open purchase orders and other commitments \nfor the purchase or construction of property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, operational commitments related to remote ground terminals, or with subcontractors on long-term construction contracts that we have with customers in the normal course of business. As of the year ended December 31, 2021, we had total short-term purchase obligations of $324 million and total long-term purchase obligations of $127 million. \nThese amounts are based on volumes consistent with anticipated requirements to fulfill purchase orders or contracts for product deliveries received, or expected to be received, from customers.\n\u200b\nWe also have short and long-term requirements to fund our pension plans within the Space Infrastructure segment. Funding requirements under applicable laws and regulations are a major consideration in making contributions to our pension plans. Failure to satisfy the minimum funding thresholds with respect to appropriate laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to amend the plans or make benefit payments. With respect to our qualified pension plan, we intend to contribute annually not less than the required minimum funding thresholds. In December 2020, we prefunded $16 million related to our qualified pension plan. Due to the December 2020 prefunding, there were no required cont\nributions for our qualified pension plan for the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 includes provisions for pension funding relief in future periods. We have elected to take advantage of these provisions and anticipate lower required contributions for our qualified pension plan in the upcoming  years. \nThe Company has no further required cont\nributions on its qualified pension plan for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nOur ability to fund our cash needs will depend, in part, on our ability to generate cash in the future, which depends on our future financial results. Our future results are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and \n56\n\n\nTable of Contents\nregulatory factors that may be outside of our control. Our future access to, and the availability of credit on acceptable terms and conditions is impacted by many factors, including capital market liquidity and overall economic conditions.\nWe believe that our cash from operating activities generated from continuing operations, together with available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, will be adequate for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future to meet our anticipated uses of cash flow, including working capital, capital expenditure, debt service costs, dividend and other commitments. While we intend to reduce debt over time using cash provided by operations, we may also seek to meet long-term debt obligations, if necessary, and fund future capital investments by obtaining capital from a variety of additional sources or by refinancing existing obligations. These sources include public or private capital markets, bank financings, proceeds from dispositions or other third-party sources.\n\u200b\nSummary of cash flows\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nYear Ended December\u00a031,\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2021\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2020\n\u200b\n2019\n($ millions)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nCash provided by operating activities - continuing operations\n\u00a0\n$\n 294\n\u00a0\n$\n 243\n\u200b\n$\n 258\nCash (used in) provided by operating activities - discontinued operations\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (13)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (54)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 59\nCash provided by operating activities\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 281\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 189\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 317\nCash used in investing activities - continuing operations\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n (234)\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n (406)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (6)\nCash provided by (used in) investing activities - discontinued operations\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 723\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (7)\nCash (used in) provided by investing activities\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (234)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 317\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (13)\nCash used in financing activities - continuing operations\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n (31)\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n (555)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (208)\nCash used in financing activities - discontinued operations\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (24)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (30)\nCash used in financing activities\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (31)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (579)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (238)\nEffect of foreign exchange on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (5)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \u2014\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, beginning of\u00a0year\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n 31\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n 109\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 43\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, end of\u00a0period\n\u00a0\n$\n 47\n\u00a0\n$\n 31\n\u200b\n$\n 109\n\u200b\nOperating activities\nCash flows from operating activities can vary significantly from period to period as a result of our working capital requirements, given our portfolio of large construction programs and the timing of milestone receipts and payments with customers and suppliers in the ordinary course of business. Investment in working capital is also necessary to build our business and manage lead times in construction activities. We expect working capital account balances to continue to vary from period to period. We efficiently fund our working capital requirements with the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below).\nCash provided by operating activities related to continuing operations increased to $294 million from $243 million, or by $51 million, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020.

The primary investing activities included expenditures on property, plant and equipment of $221 million and $257 million, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and investments in software of $87 million and $57 million, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Property, plant and equipment expenditures in 2020 and 2019 primarily related to the build of our WorldView Legion satellites. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we also used cash of $120 million, net of cash received, to acquire the remaining interest in Vricon. In 2019, these expenditures were partially offset by net proceeds of $280 million from the sale and subsequent leaseback of our properties in Palo Alto, California. California. Cash used in investing activities was also partially offset by a return of capital from discontinued operations of $20 million and $28 million, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nFinancing activities\nCash used in financing activities related to continuing operations decreased to $31 million from $555 million, or by $524 million, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020.

As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we had $28 million and $31 million, respectively, of issued and undrawn letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nSenior Secured Notes due 2023\nIn December 2019, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 2023 Notes in a private placement to institutional buyers. The 2023 Notes were issued at a price of 98% and are recorded as long-term debt in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The 2023 Notes bear interest at the rate of 9.75% per year, payable semi-annually in cash in arrears, for which interest payments commenced in June 2020. The 2023 Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each of the Company\u2019s existing and future subsidiaries that guarantee the Syndicated Credit Facility.\nSenior Secured Notes due 2027\nIn June 2020, we issued $150 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.54% Senior Secured Notes due 2027 (\u201c2027 Notes\u201d) in a private placement to institutional buyers. The 2027 Notes were issued at a price of 98.25% and are recorded as long-term debt in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

The 2027 Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each of the Company\u2019s existing and future subsidiaries that guarantee the Syndicated Credit Facility and the 2023 Notes. \nLeaseback Deferred Financing\nIn December 2019, we completed the sale and subsequent leaseback of our owned properties in Palo Alto, California for proceeds of $291 million. We determined that the leaseback terms were off-market. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 842 \u2013 Leases, we accounted for the excess of the leaseback payments over the present value of market rental payments as additional financing, separate from the lease liability. This resulted in recognition of a deferred financing liability of $33 million which is repayable over the 10-year leaseback term.\nSee Note 12, \u201cLong-term debt and interest expense, net\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, \n\u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d \nfor further details on our long-term debt.\nSecuritization liability\nWe have in place a revolving securitization facility agreement with an international financial institution. Under the terms of the Syndicated Credit Facility, we may offer to sell eligible orbital receivables from time to time with terms of seven years or less, discounted to face value using prevailing market rates. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we did not sell or repurchase any orbital receivables. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we did not sell any eligible receivables and repurchased $24 million of specifically identified orbital receivables. The orbital receivables were repurchased as a result of our customer transferring the obligation to another entity which did not meet the credit criteria of our lenders. \nThe orbital receivables that were securitized remain on our balance sheet as the accounting criteria for surrendering control of the orbital receivables were not met. The net proceeds received have been recognized as a securitization liability that has been subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. The securitized orbital receivables and the securitization liabilities are being drawn down as payments are received from customers and passed on to the international financial institution. We continue to recognize orbital revenue on the orbital receivables that are subject to the securitization transactions and recognize interest expense to accrete the securitization liability.\n59\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had no outstanding foreign exchange sales contracts. As of December 31, 2021, we had certain letters of credit of $28 million guaranteed by the Syndicated Credit Facility, while indemnified by us. Such arrangements are not expected to have a material effect on our liquidity or capital resources, financial position or results of operations.\nWe use, from time to time, derivative financial instruments to manage existing foreign currency exposures. We consider the management of financial risks to be an important part of our overall corporate risk management policy. Foreign exchange forward contracts are used to hedge our exposure to currency risk on sales, purchases, cash, net investments and loans denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of our domestic and foreign operations.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Note\u00a02, \u201cSummary of significant accounting policies\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, \n\u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d. \n\u200b\nWe consider the following accounting policies to be critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because these policies require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments on the part of management in their application. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\u200b\nRevenue recognition\n\u200b\nThe recognition and measurement of revenue requires the use of judgments and estimates. Specifically, judgment is used in interpreting complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions and determining when all criteria for revenue recognition have been met.\n\u200b\nSpace Infrastructure\n\u200b\nRevenue in the Space Infrastructure segment is primarily generated from long-term construction contracts. Due to the long-term nature of these contracts, we generally recognize revenue over time using the cost-to-cost method to measure progress. Under the cost-to-cost method, revenue is recognized based on the proportion of total costs incurred to EAC. Revenue recognition is also contingent on estimated contractual consideration. An EAC includes all direct costs and indirect costs directly attributable to a program or allocable based on program cost pooling arrangements. Estimates regarding the Company\u2019s cost associated with the design, manufacture and delivery of products and services are used in determining the EAC. Changes to an EAC or estimated contractual consideration are recorded as a cumulative adjustment to revenue.\n\u200b\nOur cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge of our engineering, program management and financial professionals and draws on their significant experience and judgment. We prepare EACs for our contracts and calculate estimated revenues and costs over the life of our contracts. Since our contracts typically span a period of several years, estimation of revenue, cost and progress toward completion requires the use of judgment. Judgments and estimates are re-assessed at least quarterly with most estimates being updated on a monthly basis. Adjustments in estimates could have a material impact on revenue recognition based on the significance of the adjustments. Factors considered in these estimates include our historical performance, the availability, productivity and cost of labor, the nature and complexity of work to be performed, availability and cost of materials, components and subcontracts, the risk and impact of delayed performance and the level of indirect cost allocations.\n\u200b\n60\n\n\nTable of Contents\nEarth Intelligence\n\u200b\nRevenue in the Earth Intelligence segment is generated from imagery and geospatial intelligence service contracts. Revenue from imagery service contracts is recognized based on satellite capacity made available to the customer in a particular period, when imagery is delivered to the customer, or ratably over the subscription period. Many of our imagery service contracts relate to the transfer of a series of distinct goods or services over time for which management has determined are a single performance obligation. Revenue from our geospatial intelligence service contracts is recognized from the rendering of services that compensate us at a cost-plus-fixed-fee, firm fixed price, or on a time and materials basis.\n\u200b\nSome of our contracts contain multiple performance obligations, which requires us to estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation in order to allocate consideration transferred from the customer. We have not historically been able to use third-party evidence for determining standalone selling price due to the unique nature of our products and services and lack of visibility into competitor pricing. Standalone selling prices are determined based on management estimates that involve significant judgment. Multiple factors are considered based on the nature of the deliverables included within the contract, which include market conditions, competitive landscape, geographic or regional specific factors, internal costs, profit margin objectives and pricing practices used by us.\n\u200b\nIncome Taxes \n\u200b\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States, Sweden and other foreign jurisdictions. We compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the currently enacted tax rates that are expected to apply in years in which they are expected to be paid for or realized. All deferred income taxes are classified as non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Significant judgments are required in order to determine the realizability of tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence, including historical operating results, estimates of future sources of taxable income, carry-forward periods available, the existence of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and other relevant factors. \n\u200b\nFor further information regarding our deferred tax assets and liabilities see Note 2, \u201cSummary of significant accounting policies\u201d and Note 21, \u201cIncome taxes\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, \n\u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d \n\u200b\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee Note 3, \u201cNew standards and interpretations not yet adopted\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, \n\u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d\n for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. \nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nIn addition to results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental indicators of our financial and operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures include EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin.\n\u200b\nWe define EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for certain items affecting the comparability of our ongoing operating results as specified in the calculation and Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Certain items affecting the comparability of our ongoing operating results between periods include restructuring, impairments, insurance recoveries, gain (loss) on sale of assets, CEO severance, (gain) loss on orbital receivables allowance and transaction and integration related expense. Transaction and integration related expense includes costs associated with de-leveraging activities, acquisitions and dispositions and the integration of acquisitions. Management believes that exclusion of these items assists in providing a more complete understanding of our underlying results and trends, and management uses these measures along with the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures to manage our business, evaluate our performance compared to prior \n61\n\n\nTable of Contents\nperiods and the marketplace, and to establish operational goals. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure being used as a key element of our incentive compensation plan. The Syndicated Credit Facility also uses Adjusted EBITDA in the determination of our debt leverage covenant ratio. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA in the Syndicated Credit Facility includes a more comprehensive set of adjustments that may result in a different calculation therein.\nWe believe that these non-GAAP measures, when read in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results, provide useful information to investors by facilitating the comparability of our ongoing operating results over the periods presented, the ability to identify trends in our underlying business, and the comparison of our operating results against analyst financial models and operating results of other public companies.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not recognized terms under U.S. GAAP and may not be defined similarly by other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered alternatives to net (loss) income as indications of financial performance or as alternate to cash flows from operations as measures of liquidity. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under U.S. GAAP.\nThe table below reconciles our net income (loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nYear Ended December\u00a031,\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2021\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2020\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2019\n\u200b\n($ millions)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nNet income\n\u200b\n$\n 46\n\u200b\n$\n 303\n\u200b\n$\n 109\n\u200b\nIncome tax (benefit) expense\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (13)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (22)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 5\n\u200b\nInterest expense, net\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 151\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 175\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 219\n\u200b\nInterest income\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (3)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (3)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (2)\n\u200b\nDepreciation and amortization\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 290\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 348\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 376\n\u200b\nEBITDA\n\u200b\n$\n 471\n\u200b\n$\n 801\n\u200b\n$\n 707\n\u200b\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (349)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (26)\n\u200b\nRestructuring\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 2\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 18\n\u200b\nTransaction and integration related expense\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 1\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 7\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 16\n\u200b\n(Gain) loss on orbital receivables allowance\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (49)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 14\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 14\n\u200b\nImpairment losses, including inventory\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 33\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 3\n\u200b\nInsurance recoveries\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (1)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (183)\n\u200b\nLoss (gain) on sale of assets\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 1\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (136)\n\u200b\nCEO severance\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 3\n\u200b\nGain on remeasurement of Vricon equity interest\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (85)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \u2014\n\u200b\nTotal Adjusted EBITDA\n\u200b\n$\n 424\n\u200b\n$\n 422\n\u200b\n$\n 416\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nAdjusted EBITDA:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nEarth Intelligence\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 492\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 513\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 548\n\u200b\nSpace Infrastructure\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 46\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (3)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (17)\n\u200b\nIntersegment eliminations\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (25)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (27)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (29)\n\u200b\nCorporate and other expenses\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (89)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (61)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (86)\n\u200b\nTotal Adjusted EBITDA\n\u200b\n$\n 424\n\u200b\n$\n 422\n\u200b\n$\n 416\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nNet income margin\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 2.6\n%\n\u200b\n 17.6\n%\n\u200b\n 6.5\n%\nTotal Adjusted EBITDA margin\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 24.0\n%\n\u200b\n 24.5\n%\n\u200b\n 25.0\n%\n\u200b\n\u200b\n62\n\n\nTable of Contents", "item7a": ">ITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest Rate Risk\n\u200b\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk on our variable-rate borrowings under our Syndicated Credit Facility, which is comprised of the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan B. We use interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with cash outflows from long-term debt. \n\u200b\nThere was $1.44 billion outstanding under our Syndicated Credit Facility as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Term Loan B bears interest equal to, at our option, either (i) U.S. dollar LIBOR plus 275 basis points per annum, or (ii) adjusted base rate, plus a margin of 175 basis points per annum. In April 2018, we entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to fix the base interest rate to be paid over an aggregate amount of $1 billion of our variable rate long-term debt, at an average rate of 2.56% (excluding the margin specified in the Syndicated Credit Facility). In April 2021, $500 million of these interest rate swaps matured and on June 15, 2021, we entered into new interest rate swap agreements at a notional value of $500 million. As of December 31, 2021, an aggregate amount of $1 billion of our variable rate long-term debt is fixed at an average rate of 1.43% plus the applicable margin described below.\n \n\u200b\nThe Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (i) U.S. dollar LIBOR, plus a margin of 120 - 425 basis points per annum, based on our total leverage ratio, or (ii) adjusted base rate, plus a margin of 20 - 325 basis points per annum, based on our total leverage ratio.\n\u200b\nBased upon the amounts outstanding under the Syndicated Credit Facility, net of the interest rate swaps and assuming the amounts were outstanding for a full calendar year, a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would increase interest expense under the Syndicated Credit Facility by approximately $2 million for both the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. We may decide in future periods to engage in hedging transactions to further mitigate the interest rate risk under our Syndicated Credit Facility.\nForeign Currency Risk\nAlthough the majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars, some of our transactions are denominated in foreign currencies. Certain contractual relationships with customers and vendors mitigate risks from currency exchange rate changes that arise from normal purchasing and normal sales activities. Our revenue and purchase contracts are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies may make payments in U.S. dollars, as provided for under our existing contracts, more difficult for foreign customers. In addition, fluctuations in foreign currencies could introduce volatility into our financial statements for contracts denominated in a foreign currency. \n\u200b\n63\n\n\nTable of Contents", "companyName": "MAXAR TE", "cusip": "57778K105"}
