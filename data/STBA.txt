A Message from Chris McComish
Chris McComish
Chief Executive OfficerI’m pleased to welcome you to 
S&T Bancorp’s first Corporate 
Responsibility Report. At S&T, we 
believe that organizations of any kind 
cannot thrive without the benefit 
of policies that guide the way they 
interact with customers, support 
their communities, and care for their 
employees. We are committed to 
conducting our business guided 
by policies and practices that:
• Promote strong and transparent 
corporate governance and a 
corporate culture that is driven 
by high ethical standards
• Foster a workplace that improves 
the lives of our employees by 
providing a safe, welcoming 
environment that promotes inclusivity, mutual respect, and 
competitive pay and benefits
• Build an organization that gives 
back to the community, through 
philanthropic programs, volunteer 
efforts, and business practices 
that support the empowerment 
and advancement of individual 
customers, families, businesses, 
and charitable organizations 
and targeted programs
• Minimize S&T’s consumption of 
energy and generation of waste 
to help protect our environment. 
Within our business relationships, 
we also work directly with 
our customers to support 
their own visions of a cleaner, 
more efficient environment
These practices are not only good for 
the environment, our communities 
and our employees, but they’re also 
good for business. They reduce risk 
and potential liability; they foster a 
more productive and stable workforce, 
and they promote good will and trust among our customers. Everybody 
benefits—our employees, our 
communities, and our shareholders. 
I am immensely proud of our people, 
our culture, and both the enduring 
long-term and new business 
relationships that we continue to build 
and support. And by no means are we 
finished—corporate responsibility is 
an ongoing endeavor, one that must 
adapt to new conditions, grow into 
new areas, and be ever-vigilant to 
the demands of a complex society. 
I want to thank our more than 
1,100 employees, our customers, 
and our shareholders for 
their faith and trust in us. 
Sincerely,
The vision of S&T is to become the 
financial services provider of choice 
in the markets we serve by delivering 
exceptional service, one customer 
at a time. Founded in 1902, S&T 
Bank provides a full range of financial 
services to families and businesses 
throughout Pennsylvania, Ohio, and 
New York. 
S&T Bank’s mission is to create

our communities, and our shareholders.
As a corporate citizen, S&T chooses 
to proactively live out the core 
value to support our communities 
by providing financial products and 
services in the markets we serve. 
S&T recognizes the significance of

banking laws, including the Equal 
Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), Fair 
Housing Act (FHA), Home Mortgage 
Disclosure Act (HMDA), and the 
Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). 
S&T also recognizes the importance 
of following the principle-based 
concepts under Unfair, Deceptive, or 
Abusive Acts or Practices (UDAAP). 
Social
Our community giveback program, 
formally developed over a decade ago, 
is a central component of the Bank's 
commitment to the local markets 
we have the privilege to serve. At 
S&T, giving back to the community 
is multi-faceted and includes our 
investment in people, programs, 
financial solutions, and donations 
of time and resources. We deliver a 
variety of financial products, services, 
targeted programs, and activities 
that contribute to the advancement 
of individual consumers, families, 
small and large business endeavors, government, non-profit and for-
profit agencies and organizations.
In 2021, S&T contributed to our 
communities through donations 
from our charitable foundation and 
through participation in federal and 
state tax credits for low-income 
housing, educational, and community 
improvement initiatives. Our 
employees volunteered time and 
contributed money through payroll 
deductions to nonprofits like the 
United Way and local food banks.

S&T Bank's Pam Price and Genevieve Oduor, presented  
a donation to Maggie Beldecos, chief operating officer 
of the Trade Institute of Pittsburgh. 
resources allocated elsewhere to 
assist the Bank and our customers. 
To further our commitment to health 
and safety, plexi-glass shields were 
installed at teller windows across all 
branch locations, masks were provided 
to all employees and customers, 
and a rigorous sanitation process 
was implemented in every office.
Our communications were amplified 
through the use of a human resources 
Coronavirus email inbox that was 
monitored 24/7 to provide an 
open line of communication and 
to ensure that needs were met 
across our entire footprint. 
Business lines were asked where 
their greatest needs were and 
as a result, employees willingly 
shifted to different roles based on 
those needs. Work locations were 
swiftly reconfigured, modified work 
schedules were developed, laptops 
were ordered, and communications 
were maintained through Microsoft 
Teams, Zoom, email, and our intranet. 
Employees worked with incredible 
flexibility and willingness to respond in 
a positive way to maintain the powerful 
culture that we have at S&T Bank. Covid-19 response 
Customer relief and paycheck 
protection program (PPP)
S&T Bank understood that the country 
faced an unprecedented challenge 
of financial uncertainty. As a result 
of the global pandemic, the Bank 
observed and understood that the 
needs of customers were evolving 
quickly and took action to address 
those needs. The Bank worked with 
customers to offer payment deferrals 
and temporary relief programs to 
assist customers with a wide variety 
of circumstances and unique needs. 
In addition to payment deferral 
and relief programs, S&T's 
dedicated bankers were prepared 
to assist businesses with the 
Paycheck Protection Program.
4Employee support
The message to our team at the 
onset of this pandemic was that S&T 
Bank would be open for business 
and that we would provide essential 
services to our customers and 
communities. It was emphasized 
that the work we do each day makes 
a difference to those we serve and 
support. Creativity and commitment 
from our employees to help both 
customers and our local communities 
did not go unnoticed. The selfless, 
unrelenting effort of our employees 
was met with deep appreciation by 
our leadership team during these 
uncertain and challenging times.
At the beginning of the pandemic,  
we assessed the childcare needs of  
employees as daycares and  
schools were closing and they were 
needing to rely on family members and 
friends. In 2020, the Bank implemented 
a childcare reimbursement program 
that provided up to $300 weekly for 
our employees' childcare expenses. 
As an ongoing means of support, 
we also offer a dedicated employee 
assistance program to provide 
confidential, no cost assistance to 
improve the mental well-being of 
all employees, spouses, dependent 
children, parents, and parents-in-law. 
In April 2020, S&T adjusted retail 
branch schedules to rotational 
shifts, allowing branch employees 
to work one week in branch and 
take one week off with no change 
to salaries or compensation. 
This scheduling adjustment was 
provisioned in an effort to create 
a safer working environment.
Additionally, applicable retail branches 
were shifted to drive-thru only 
during the height of the pandemic 
to continue to serve the needs of 
our customers while maximizing 
the safety of our employees and 
our customers. Branches without 
drive-thru only options hadS&T did not lay off or 
furlough employees 
during the pandemic.
$162,000+
was provided in 2020 
and 2021 to employees 
through the S& T childcare 
reimbursement program.S&T received over  
1,500 applications  
in the second round  
of the Paycheck  
Protection Program.

We were able to help  
more than 3,400 small 
businesses across our footprint 
throughout both rounds of the 
Paycheck Protection Program.

financial education through 
partnership with Junior Achievement 
of Western PA; and organizations 
such as the Indiana County Recovery 
Center and Penn Highlands 
Healthcare that support the health 
and well-being of our communities. Volunteer efforts
Supporting our communities is 
at the heart of our core values at 
S& T , and during Covid-19, the S& T 
team took swift action to meet a 
variety of community needs. As a 
result of the pandemic's impact, 
food banks saw a record number of 
Americans needing help. T o meet 
the increased need, 98 employees  
volunteered 445 hours  of time at 
39 community food banks  across 
our footprint. Additionally, S& T team 
members donated blood, walked to 
support cancer research, cleaned 
parks and trailways, placed wreaths 
on the graves of fallen soldiers 
during the holiday season, and 
participated in numerous fundraising 
activities. Bank team members 
supported local schools, churches, 
and community organizations, and 
provided love and care to our four-
legged friends through adoption 
activities and animal care services. 
In 2021, S&T employees volunteered 
through  1,420 service activities at  
274  organizations, totalling 5,250 
community service hours.
46 team members provided 
leadership support to  62 
organizations giving their time

communities and underrepresented 
populations by investing $17.7 
million  through Low Income Housing 
T ax Credit (LIHTC) projects, Small 
Business Investment Companies 
(SBICs), Keystone Innovation Zone T ax 
Credits (KIZ), Education Improvement 
T ax Credits (EITC), Neighborhood 
Assistance Program T ax Credits (NAP), 
and specialized investments like the 
Power of 32. These investments 
supported affordable housing, 
economic development, education 
programs, revitalized and stabilized 
underserved areas, and helped combat 
food insecurity.

Community development loans 
S&T's commitment to helping 
underserved low to moderate income 
communities continues through our 
financial support of organizations 
that develop affordable housing and 
advance economic development 
in communities in need. S&T also 
provided over $99 million  in 
community development loans across 
our footprint. These loans supported 
affordable housing, economic 
development needs, and served 
to revitalize or stabilize 
underserved areas. S&T loaned an additional $38.2 
million  to projects exclusively in 
support of affordable housing. These 
funds resulted in the creation of 374 
affordable housing units including:
• 24-unit apartment building in a 
low-income area where one-third 
of tenants are currently subsidized 
with Section 8 vouchers
• 86 units of income based 
independent living for seniors
• 72-unit multi-family apartment 
complex in a designated 
CRA development area
7to, low down payment requirements 
of 3%, an allowance to include income 
from all earners in a household, and a 
loan-to-value up to 97 percent. This 
flexible financing product can be used 
for both purchases and refinancing of 
existing properties. 
S&T supports workforce housing 
through its Community Champions 
loan program. This specialized 
mortgage product includes low 
down payment options, expanded 
loan-to-value ratios, no mortgage 
insurance requirements, and 
discounted origination fees. The 
Community Champions Loan Program 
offers financing for public or private 
chartered school teachers, registered 
nurses, EMTs, employees of a police 
force, and paid firefighters.
Through our Professional Mortgages 
loan program, we offer mortgage 
loans with low down payment options, 
expanded loan-to-value ratios, and 
no mortgage insurance requirements 
to medical doctors, attorneys, and 
doctorate degree-holders.
The Home4 Good program helps 
those who are homeless or at risk of 
homelessness by channeling dollars 
to local service organizations that 
know how to help. Funding is offered 
annually by FHLBank Pittsburgh and 
several other state housing agencies. 
This funding would not be possible without partners like S&T Bank. 
S&T continues to participate in the 
Home4 Good program in support 
of eliminating homelessness and 
combatting housing insecurity for 
those most in need. 
We are proud to partner with and 
help service members, Veterans, and 
eligible surviving spouses on their 
homeownership journey through 
our VA Loan program. As part of the 
Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) 
mission, they provide a home loan 
guaranty benefit and other housing-
related programs to Veterans where 
they can buy, build, repair, retain, or 
adapt a home for their own personal 
occupancy. Through this product, S&T 
is able to offer competitive interest 
rates, low or no down payment 
options, and no Private Mortgage 
Insurance (PMI) to eligible service 
members, Veterans, and in certain 
instances, a surviving spouse. 
Federal Housing Authority (FHA) 
Loans are another affordable housing 
product that S&T can provide to 
eligible first-time homebuyers. FHA 
home loans require lower minimum 
credit scores and down payments than 
many conventional loans, which makes 
them especially popular with first-time 
homebuyers. The FHA loan is designed 
to help low to moderate income 
families attain their own home. Homeownership loan products
S&T provides loan products that 
meet our customers where they are 
in the home buying process. The Bank 
participates in several loan programs 
to help our customers make the dream 
of homeownership a reality. We are 
dedicated to supporting affordable 
housing in our communities. In 2021, 
we assisted 187 customers with 
loans through the following programs: 
S&T Bank is a participating lender in 
FHLBank Pittsburgh’s First Front 
Door grant program. Through this 
partnership, S&T helps eligible first-
time home buyers access an effective 
down payment and closing cost 
assistance grant program. FHLBank 
Pittsburgh members like S&T provide 
first mortgage financing while First 
Front Door matches $3 for every  
$1 that borrowers contribute to  
down payment and closing costs,  
up to $5,000.
Helping individuals and families 
overcome financial hurdles to home 
ownership is at the heart of our core 
value of serving our customers. As 
part of our suite of mortgage loan 
products, S&T is proud to offer Home 
Ready Loans. Home Ready Loans are a 
Fannie Mae product designed to serve 
credit-worthy, low- and moderate-
income borrowers. Benefits to the 
borrower include, but are not limited 

Customer relations/
community needs
S&T Bank offers funding for college 
age customers through funds donated 
to the Bank’s Smart Start Banking 
customers. Annually, five $2,500 
scholarships  are awarded.
Educating customers has become 
an enhanced focus of S&T in recent 
years as we strive to serve our 
customers, support our communities, 
communicate, and build long-standing 
trust as our mission calls us to do. 
We recognize that customer needs 
and expectations are ever evolving 
and our role includes providing 
guidance, financial education, 
professional advice, and transparent 
communication regarding account 
level details. As a result, in 2021 
we added a new digital onboarding 
experience for new checking account 
customers and additional online 
resources to help customers choose 
accounts and programs that are best 
suited for them. Additionally, we have 
invited our customers to seminars 
related to information security, 
investment strategies, and retirement 
planning. S&T believes in assisting our 
customers to be safe, prepared, and 
well-informed at all stages of life.
Financial education
Financial education is a key building 
block to financial independence 
and advancement. Early education 
can lead to enhanced savings, 
achieving financial goals, and a 
healthy relationship with money. 
S&T supports financial education 
through partnerships with Junior 
Achievement, local school districts, 
colleges, and universities. S&T 
employees provided 24 hours of 
financial education to three  schools, 
over nine days  in May 2021.
S&T supports our customers' needs 
to save for college, plan for home 
ownership, prepare for retirement, 
and be ready for any financial goal they 
want to achieve. S&T’s commitment 
to financial education includes online 
resources at stbank.com/learn. These 
online resources include budgeting 
insights, account management tools, 
first-time homebuyer tips, credit 
score basics, and much more. 8S&T Bank

Governance
Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors of S&T 
Bancorp, Inc. sets high standards 
for S&T's employees, officers, 
and directors. Implicit in this 
philosophy is the importance of 
sound corporate governance. It is 
the duty of the Board of Directors 
to serve as a prudent fiduciary for 
shareholders and to oversee the 
management of the company's 
business. The Bank's governance 
practices foster a commitment 
to following best practices and 
an effective risk management 
process to serve the interests of 
S&T , our customers, employees, 
partners, and shareholders. The 
board has developed and adopted 
corporate governance guidelines, 
which reflect S&T’s commitment 
to these governance practices. The 
guidelines are available at stbancorp.
com/corporate-governance. 
S&T maintains an efficient and 
effective operations and risk 
management team to provide a 
comprehensive level of protection 
necessary to ensure the safety of 
our customers and colleagues while 
continuing to achieve shareholder 
value. The board is composed 
of 12 members, with ten (83%) 
independent directors under the 
NASDAQ listing rules. The board is 
increasing in diversity, with two female 
directors and one African American 
director. The board is chaired by 
a woman. These independent and 
diverse directors bring a wealth of 
knowledge and business experience 
to S&T. For additional information 
about our directors’ experience 
and qualifications, visit stbancorp.

com/corporate-governance. Advisory boards
We take our commitment to and 
impact on the community very 
seriously. It’s important for us to 
understand the needs of our markets. 
Advisory boards help us do just 
that. The mission of S& T Bank’s 
advisory boards is to bring business 
and community leaders together 
to provide insight into industry 
trends and banking experiences as 
well as advice regarding products/
services, business development, and 
recruitment. It’s a partnership between 
the Bank and the communities that 
we serve. Members offer informed 
suggestions and opinions regarding 
S& T’s products and services in 
the market, an understanding of 
the local economy, and insight 
into the competitive outlook. 
10Risk management
S& T has an Enterprise Risk 
Management (ERM) program in place 
to identify, assess, measure, monitor , 
report, and mitigate excessive risk 
across our organization. While we 
recognize that risk is an inevitable 
part of doing business, we need to 
determine how much risk we are willing 
to bear. We make decisions within the 
context of our risk appetite statement. 
Our board oversees the management 
of our risk-appetite statement to 
optimize long-term shareholder value 
while supporting our employees, 
customers, and communities. 
The board’s risk committee is 
responsible for overseeing S&T’s 
risk management activities and the 
effectiveness of its ERM framework. 
An example is monitoring our 
compliance risk with respect to 
regulatory and legal matters and our 
cybersecurity program to protect our 
employees, clients, communities, and 
infrastructure. Our Enterprise Risk 
Management Committee (ERMC) is 
comprised of our executive leadership 
team, and is responsible for monitoring 
risk exposures of the enterprise 
and promoting risk management 
practices throughout S&T. Our ERM 
framework is overseen by our chief 
risk officer, who has a dual reporting 
relationship, directly accountable to 
both the board 's risk committee and 
our CEO. You can find a description 
of the principal risks overseen by board 
committees in our proxy statement.
In addition, management has 
established internal committees that 
provide oversight for various elements 
of our business that contribute to our 
risk management activities including:• Asset/liability management 
committee
• Enterprise risk management 
committee
• Compliance committee 
• CRA/fair lending committee 
• Information security committee
• Financial intelligence committee
• Data governance committee
• Disclosure control committee
• Business continuity committee
Data privacy and cybersecurity
The board’s risk committee oversees 
management’s programs and controls 
to maintain data privacy of customer 
records and cybersecurity. The risk 
committee reviews reports from and 
has discussions with S&T’s chief risk 
officer , chief security officer, chief 
compliance officer , and director of 
operations to ensure the adequacy of 
data security programs and controls.
Third-party risk management
S& T’s enterprise risk management 
practices extend to our supply chain. 
The risk committee oversees our 
third-party risk management program 
which is designed to identify, manage, 
and minimize third-party risk through 
a centralized approach aligned with 
regulatory guidance and industry best 
practices. We manage the program 
to optimize Bank performance and 
enhance customer experience. 
Executive compensation
S&T’s approach to goal setting, setting 
of targets with payouts at multiple 
levels of performance, and evaluation 
of performance results, assist in 
mitigating excessive risk taking that 
could harm our value or reward poor judgment by our executives. We 
believe that several features of our 
compensation policies and programs 
reflect sound risk management 
practices. This includes basing 
incentive awards on the achievement 
of a predetermined earnings per share 
(EPS) goal (an audited number) and 
granting restricted stock subject to 
a two or three year vesting period 
that serves the additional purposes 
of encouraging senior management 
to make decisions currently that 
promote long-term growth, promote 
retention of senior management, 
and encourage senior management 
to meet stock ownership guidelines. 
All awards granted under the 2021 
incentive plans were subject to 
compensation committee review 
and approval based upon corporate 
and/or individual performance. The 
incentive plan for senior management, 
as described in the compensation 
discussion and analysis section of 
the proxy statement, contains a 
minimum gateway requirement and a 
shareholder protection feature, which 
provides a guarantee that awards will 
not be made unless S&T achieves a 
Return on Average Equity of at least 
5% and maintains well capitalized 
capital ratio requirements, as 
established by applicable regulatory 
authorities. S&T believes that 
compensation among base salary and 
short and long-term compensation 
target opportunities does not 
encourage excessive risk-taking. 

Environment
S&T, as a financial institution, has 
policies that address how business is 
done with customers. Our objective 
is to reduce, as much as possible, the 
potential harm to the environment.
In our operations, with advice and 
oversight of S&T’s Board of Directors, 
we regularly seek to minimize 
our consumption of energy and 
utilize environmentally conscious 
operating strategies wherever 
possible. This is not only good for 
the environment, but also reduces 
our costs. Management has made 
and continues to make significant 
operating and capital expenditures in 
various technologies including cloud-
based solutions; comprehensive 
end-to-end loan origination systems 
that employ automated workflow 
and digital document management; 
digital banking including consumer 
and business online banking and 
mobile solutions for account opening, 
statements, bill pay, loan applications, 
and deposits; and eWorkflow 
integrated solutions to streamline 
document flow and retention efforts.
Digital tools
Our technology reduces paper usage 
and our reliance on paper-intensive 
processes. These initiatives lessen our 
carbon footprint while making it easier 
for clients to do business with us.
In 2021, we 
implemented 
DocuSign solutions 
in our treasury 
management and 
wealth management 
departments. 
Utilizing DocuSign has allowed us 
to process over 1,300 total files 
electronically. We have plans to 
expand our DocuSign usage to other 
areas throughout the Bank in order 
to continue transforming paper 
processes to a digital workflow. This is 
part of a robust road map focused on 
working toward greater environmental 
consciousness and providing 
convenient options for our customers.Encouraging customers and 
employees to go paperless
We encourage customers to use 
online and mobile banking and to 
opt-in for electronic 
statements, not 
only for greater 
convenience but 
also to help them 
reduce their own 
environmental 
impact. Bank-wide, eWorkflow and 
eSign initiatives have been initiated, 
reducing paper consumption. As 
a result, 34% less paper was used 
in 2021 compared to 2017.
Reducing waste
Recycling efforts have been 
established across our entire footprint, 
including buildings and branches where 
recycling is supported. Our water 
fountains in all Indiana, PA corporate 
offices have been retrofitted to 
fill reusable water bottles, helping 
to reduce plastic waste.
Reducing energy and resource usage
Automatic light sensors are being 
installed in all new construction and 
have been installed at Corporate 
Headquarters and in various offices 
throughout Indiana, PA. LED lights will 
be installed at all new construction 
and have been installed at Corporate, 
Indian Springs, Camp Hill, Centerville, 
Boothwyn, Ludwigs Corner, and 
Exton, with two additional branches 
scheduled in 2022. All exterior lighting 
has been updated to LED Bank-wide.
Environmental impact through 
loans and customer relationships
S&T has a long-standing commitment 
to the environment and works directly 
with our customers to support their 
visions of a cleaner, brighter future, 
free from contaminants and waste. 
S&T’s relationship with one customer 
over the past several decades has led 
to the cleaning and redevelopment of 
an area left decimated by the collapse 
of the steel industry. The revitalization 
of a former steel mill and brownfield site into an award winning and 
thriving industrial complex was made 
possible through this relationship.
Another customer providing 
professional planning, design, and 
engineering services to shape, define, 
utilize, conserve, and restore land 
and water resources, completed 
several successful outdoor projects 
in northeast Ohio such as giving a 
face lift to a popular lakefront beach 
as well as the construction of trails 
for biking and hiking activities. 
In addition, S&T has supported 
a customer who provides waste 
hauling, recycling, renewable energy, 
and environmental services. 
This customer employs nearly 600 
people and provides services to 24 
counties in western PA and eastern 
OH. Their recycling business helps 
find a new home for many of the 
materials that consumers throw 
away by diverting reusable resources 
from entering a landfill. They recycle 
millions of tons of materials each year. 
S&T knows that it not only makes 
good business sense to support 
these environmentally conscious 
customers - it is the right thing to do 
for the economy and the environment.

Employees
S&T strives to hire 
and retain talented 
people who are based 
in our communities 
and will provide 
premier financial 
products and services 
to our customers. 
We primarily employ 
full time employees, 
with less than ten 
percent of employees 
being part-time or 
temporary. The Bank 
offers all employees 
health care, dental, 
vision, and term life 
insurance benefits, as 
well as participation in the qualified 
defined contribution plan. 
Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I)
The S&T Bank mindset is to encourage, 
develop, and inspire all employees 
to achieve their best, motivated by 
their own personal development. Our 
commitment is to a diverse, equitable, 
and inclusive workplace where 
everyone utilizes their knowledge, 
skills, abilities, and unique interests to 
help each other find success and drive 
positive results. The compensation 
and benefits committee of the S&T 
Board annually measures the success 
of DE&I initiatives by reviewing our 
strategies and statistics from the S&T 
Human Capital Management System.
In 2021, S&T created the role of vice 
president, business development and 
diversity relationship officer to execute 
our DE&I strategy in our communities 
through our consumer bank to conduct 
business development and to build 
relationships with minorities and 
minority-owned organizations. This 
role partners with our vice president of 
talent acquisition and DE&I engagement 
in employee services, which facilitates 
S&T’s diversity initiatives to provide 
financial literacy to members of our

surrounding communities, and 
to identify meaningful programs 
to offer our employees. We have 
seen much success in building 
relationships with our customers in 
the Pittsburgh market for many years 
and look to expand this initiative 
throughout our entire footprint. 
A new program launching in 2022 is 
the S&T Bank Equality Scholarship. 
This scholarship has been designed 
to assist with the financial needs of 
minority high school students in their 
pursuit of post-secondary education 
as well as provide an opportunity to 
gain exposure to the financial services 
industry through a paid internship. The 
intention of this initiative is to provide 
opportunities for students who 
may not have previously considered 
a career in financial services 
through their career exploration. 
Employee resource groups (ERG)
The Bank has established four ERGs.
Community Cares T eam ERG
S&T Bank 
partnered 
with Comfort 
Cases 
providing 
backpacks 
full of 
essential items to children in foster 
care. Employees donated 700 full 
backpacks to Comfort Cases, which 
is the largest donation they have 
ever received. In addition, a check 
in the amount of $6,080 to assist 
foster children in western PA was 
contributed as an outcome of the 
generosity of our employees. 
Our community giveback program 
continues assisting with food banks 
in our market to help our neighbors 
in need. S&T employees also rose 
to the occasion and made masks 
from scratch, donating them to 
Indiana Regional Medical Center 
(IRMC). We also partnered with IRMC 
to volunteer at their COVID-19 
vaccination clinics to assist in 
preventing the spread of the virus.Embracing Abilities ERG
Through their 
commitment 
to embrace 
the abilities 
of others, 
this group 
has been able 
to focus on building relationships with 
organizations that provide services to 
individuals with disabilities. They have 
initiated partnerships with the Goodwill 
Family Foundation, Office of Vocational 
Rehabilitation, Miracle League, Arc of 
Indiana County, and many others. 
Leadership ERG
This ERG is 
focused on 
engagement 
and 
development 
of current 
and future 
leaders throughout the organization 
through webinars, discussions, 
and the introduction of the Brice 
Mentorship program in 2021.
Stars and Stripes ERG
The Stars and 
Stripes ERG 
has conducted 
a drive for 
donations in 
the Harrisburg 
area branches 
(Allentown Boulevard, Colonial Road, 
and New Cumberland) for our military 
troops stationed in Qatar. The group 
was able to send ten large boxes 
full of personal items and snacks 
for our troops this past Christmas. 
In January, an Air Force Sergeant 
returning from service, presented 
a flag in appreciation to the Stars 
and Stripes ERG for their efforts. 
They also sponsored a children’s 
patriotic coloring contest that was 
displayed in our employee newsletter , 
intranet, and in our branches. 

13Training and development
S&T Bank’s 2021 corporate 
training plan strives to enable all 
departments of the Bank with access 
to comprehensive training to enhance 
all job positions. The Bank considers 
this training plan and the core values 
described earlier to be intentional ways 
to promote diversity and inclusion; 
professional development; and safety, 
health, and wellness. The training plan 
also includes leadership development 
courses. More information about our 
employee practices can be found 
in our human capital management 
disclosure in Item 1 in Form 10-K for 
the year ended December 31, 2021. 
Employee relations and programs
Helping Hands program
S&T offers a Helping Hands 
program to employees that assists 
employees in difficult times. 
The program is fully funded by 
employees for employees. It allows 
employees to donate in two ways: 
1. Monetary contributions 
2. Donating unused paid time off (PTO)
Last year, employees donated more 
PTO time than ever before to our 
Helping Hands fund. As a result, 
we donated many gift cards, time 
off, and expense reimbursement 
to employees to assist with 
various unexpected costs.Brice Mentorship program
S&T provides paid training to our 
employees and offers a mentoring 
opportunity, the Brice Mentorship 
Program, established in 2021 in honor 
of now retired CEO, Todd Brice. The 
program pairs newer employees 
with more seasoned professionals 
in an effort to foster their career and 
experiences in the business world. 
Scholarships for employees' children
The Bank offers an annual 
scholarship program to the children 
of employees entering college as 
a freshman. Selected students 
receive a $1,000 scholarship for 
college related expenses.
Years of service
Employees are recognized for 
their years of service with service 
awards, cash gifts, and a breakfast 
(when safely able to schedule 
prior to the pandemic). 
Peak performer award
Employees are also rewarded for their 
teamwork and extra efforts through 
the Bank’s Peak Performer Award 
that spotlights an employee that is 
known to go above and beyond. 
Incredible customer experience 
awards (ICE) acknowledge 
exceptional customer service when 
a customer sends a note, email or 
card to an employee, and kudos (money awarded to the company 
store) provide a way for peers to 
recognize extra effort internally. 
For thirty years, the bank has held 
an annual All Employee Meeting 
(AEM), providing an opportunity for 
all employees to come together and 
hear first-hand from the executive 
leadership the goals and strategies 
outlined for the upcoming year. In 
2021, the meeting was pre-recorded 
and the recording was then shared 
with all employees. In 2022, the AEM 
was live-streamed to all employees. 
Health and wellness programs
Employees are provided the 
opportunity to participate in financial 
health and wellness education with 
access to programs such as the Dave 
Ramsey financial literacy program 
and lunch and learns on budgeting, 
retirement planning, elder care 
planning, and other financial topics. 
Employees have the option to 
participate in the Bank's health 
and wellness program. S&T 
health plan participants receive a 
bank contribution to their health 
savings account of up to $750 or 
$1,500 annually for individuals and 
families, respectively, for meeting 
the wellness requirements. In 
2021, the wellness requirements 
included a health risk assessment, 
a biometric screening, a flu shot, 
and health education seminars. 
We also sponsor a monthly 
walking at work program that 
encourages our team members 
to get outside and stay active.63,307In 2021, our
