OVERVIEW
KURT SIEVERS
President and CEO,  
NXP Semiconductors
continued on next pageLooking back at 2021, we faced many external challenges – from the ongoing COVID–19 pandemic, to the surge in semiconductor demand and associated supply shortage, to the historic snowstorm in Texas that forced us to idle our Austin wafer fabs under extreme conditions in an unprecedented manner.
Throughout this truly unparalleled 
time, the resilience, passion, and winning spirit of the NXP team ensured the consistency and continuity of the company. I am extremely proud of the actions taken across all our locations to protect our team members, meet customer commitments, and give back to the communities in which we live  and work as we continue to  advance our world.
We remain steadfast in our 
commitment to sustainability and making measurable year–on–year progress. I am deeply proud of what our team members achieved in the past 12 months.
2021 ACCOMPLISHMENTS
PRODUCTS
At NXP , we recognize we can be a powerful change agent as we continue to deliver innovative solutions that advance a 
more sustainable future. 
SMART TECHNOLOGY Launched our 
high-performance i.MX applications processor with dedicated hardware to 
accelerate machine learning applications in vision, voice and audio; in addition to launching the industry’s first-ever crossover microcontroller to run at 1Gigahertz. This enables smart devices to lower their energy footprint by analyzing the data at the edge, right where it is generated. Processing data at the edge reduces reliance on energy-consuming cloud communication, while also increasing data privacy. To complement our devices, NXP also released eIQ
®, an easy-to-use machine learning 
software development toolkit for manufacturers to easily add intelligence to smart home and industrial devices for enabling energy efficient productivity enhancement.
Introduced our innovative crossover 
microcontroller that enables fully charged wearables and smartwatches to last as long as 21 days in some cases  - three times longer than previously possible. Longer-lasting battery in wearables and smartwatches is not only a matter of convenience to users, but it is also a giant leap in reducing carbon footprint, especially with fast-growing use of wearables and smart watches.AUTOMOTIVE Achieved a number 
of important successes in automotive electrification, part of our strategic priority 
to create leading solutions for clean, sustainable, power-efficient electric vehicles (EVs) and EV infrastructure like charging stations. Our battery-management solutions are now used by two of the three largest EV makers in their high-voltage systems, and now power large eBus fleets in China, electric bikes in India, and energy-storage projects in the United States.
Provided solutions that save energy in vehicles 
by improving the onboard networks that manage power. We reduce the switching losses of electric motors and make it possible to turn off electronic units when not in use. What’s more, our CAN, LIN, FlexRay, and Ethernet solutions reduce the amount of wiring needed for the control network, thereby creating lighter, more energy-efficient vehicles.
GREEN INNOVATION BOND In May 
2021, to help finance our development of ever-smarter chips that reduce energy 
consumption and emissions, we launched our second Green Innovation Bond. We expect the proceeds from this USD $1 billion bond will be fully allocated at the end of 2022 and invested in projects such as increasing the energy efficiency of power adapters, extending smart mobility, preventing emissions through automated and connected traffic solutions, and reducing the amount of power consumed by smart buildings,  
the edge processors of cloud services, and  
5G cellular networks.A LETTER FROM OUR CEO

AN ESG MESSAGE FROM OUR CHIEF SUSTAINABILITY OFFICER
JENNIFER  
WUAMETT
Executive Vice President, 
General Counsel, Corporate Secretary and Chief Sustainability OfficerAt NXP , we are committed to improving people’s lives by enabling a better, safer, more secure, and sustainable world that is socially and environmentally advanced. To ensure progress and accountability to our environment, social and governance (ESG) mission, we are pleased to announce our mid– and long–term ESG goals, including goals regarding carbon neutrality and diversity.

Our ESG mission and strategy is 
dedicated to continuous improvement – from designing and manufacturing technology that positively impacts the planet and society, to achieving carbon neutrality in our operations, to increasing the number of women globally and under–represented minorities in the United States, as well as preventing human rights abuses throughout our supply chain.
Collaboration with stakeholders is key 
to the continuous improvement of our ESG program, and it’s been gratifying to watch our stakeholders become increasingly interested in the outcomes and impacts of our ESG initiatives. We aim to continue earning their trust by being transparent about our business, our practices, and our operations as they relate to ESG. In 2021, we increased our ESG focus in  a number of ways.
WHAT’S NEXT
We have now announced our mid– and long–term ESG goals, including goals regarding carbon neutrality and diversity. We will regularly review our progress towards these goals to ensure we are taking appropriate actions  as we focus on short–term objectives and pursue our longer–term strategies.   We are committed to our ESG journey and will continue to drive advancements. Our passion to enable a better, safer, more secure world is part of NXP’s DNA, and we are excited to help advance a more sustainable future!Internal Engagement 
and Governance
Recognizing that our ESG 
efforts require the support of teams and individuals across the company, we strengthened our ESG governance by expanding our ESG Management Board to include, in addition to myself and our Chief Financial Officer, our Chief Strategy Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Human Resources Officer, and EVP of Global Operations. ESG Transparency  
Transparency is another important element in our approach to ESG, and we were recognized in 2021 for our enhanced ESG reporting practices. Three ratings organizations – MSCI, ISS ESG, and Sustainalytics – placed us above average among our peers, and MSCI raised our rating from B+ to AA.Shareholder

RESPONDING TO COVID–19
NXP has always prioritized the health and safety of our team 
members. Throughout the pandemic, we have monitored developments, consulted external experts, and worked with NXP country and site leaders to establish and maintain stringent protocols to safeguard team members on a local, regional, and global level. 
 
SAFEGUARDING OUR HEALTH
Vaccinations are a crucial weapon in the fight against COVID–19. In the first half of 2021, as several countries launched their vaccination programs, case counts improved in several parts of the world but, sadly, worsened in others. In India, for example, record–high case numbers rapidly overwhelmed the medical system. To assist our India team members and their families, we acted quickly. We provided in–home medical and critical–care support, obtained much–needed oxygen concentrators, established a crisis command center to connect team members with health, logistics, and other experts, and set up a secure, safe location to expedite vaccinations.
Elsewhere, several thousand team members and their family 
have been inoculated through NXP–specific vaccination drives in Asia and Europe. The company also donated to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) in support of the COVID–19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) initiative, to help ensure global equitable access to COVID–19 vaccines. In all locations, NXP continues to encourage vaccination through local government and health resources.
 
SUPPORTING OUR COLLEAGUES
Local NXP team members have worked in several ways to support their colleagues, families, and communities during the pandemic. For example, India NXP team members initiated a fundraiser in support of colleagues who lost family members to COVID–19. Donations were matched by the company. Team members in NXP Bangkok donated 110 beds for use in field hospitals. They also donated oxygen concentrators, blankets, and bedsheets to support community members in quarantine, arranged for daily calls from a physician, and provided medicine, food, and personal protective equipment (PPE) to fellow team members diagnosed with COVID–19 and isolating at home while waiting for hospital treatment. Local NXP teams also donated masks and other PPE to nearby hospitals where there were shortages and gave laptops to local students to help ensure access to online learning.
Throughout the year, we also provided ongoing support for the 
physical, mental, and overall well–being of our team members. Every month we shared information, tips, and best practices focused on a specific theme of well–being. People managers also received training and access to related resources, and team members had opportunities to participate in virtual seminars and exercise classes, run/walk challenges, team–building activities, in–country celebrations, and other events.
 
RETURNING TO OFFICE
At the start of the pandemic, many team members transitioned to working from home, allowing us to better protect both our team members who were required to come to our sites for essential operations as well as our team members who could perform their job duties remotely. As conditions improved in our communities around the world, we began enacting plans to return all team members to our NXP sites. We continue to adjust those plans, along with our Health & Safety protocols, to account for developments such as the emergence  
of variants. 
Recognizing that the needs of our team members have shifted 
over the course of the last two years, we remain committed to flexible work arrangements, and will continue to offer the option to work a combination of on–site and remotely if the job allows once the pandemic ends. Hybrid working models give employees the benefit of in–person interactions with their colleagues while also enjoying the conveniences of working remotely. In 2022, we will continue to follow the advice of health organizations, doctors, and scientists as we plan for the balance of our workforce to return to the office.
2021 was a difficult year, particularly as we mourn the loss 
of colleagues, family, and friends to the virus. To the NXP team, we express our admiration for their resilience and for the care and concern they’ve shown for others throughout the pandemic. This compassion and sense of community are among the company’s greatest assets. 
IN ALL LOCATIONS, NXP 
CONTINUES TO ENCOURAGE VACCINATION THROUGH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND HEALTH RESOURCES.

Green Innovation Bond  TaxationEnterprise Risk ManagementBusiness ContinuityWe use innovation to 
enable a better, safer,  more secure, and sustainable world.
We are passionate about 
technology and believe it 
can be a powerful catalyst for change. We also recognize that advances in technology can bring with them new challenges for sustainability. For this reason, we make the principals of sustainability — such as energy efficiency, safety, and security — central to our work in product development.
In this section, we highlight recent innovations in the 
healthcare, automotive, industrial & IoT, mobile, and communication infrastructure markets. 
HEALTHCARE – SMART MONITORING 
AND DATA MANAGEMENT
As COVID–19 continues to disrupt lives and 
the global economy, technology companies such as NXP play a vital role in the battle against the pandemic. One of our healthcare 
solutions, used for Continuous Temperature Monitoring (CTM), offers a convenient way  to track COVID–19 symptoms. The solution is built using an NXP NHS3100 NTAG
®SmartSensor, 
an integrated circuit, optimized for temperature monitoring and logging, that includes an NFC interface and a direct connection to the battery. The high degree of integration yields a compact, energy–efficient solution that can be tailored for use in specific healthcare applications.AUTOMOTIVE – SMART SOLUTIONS 
FOR INCREASED PERFORMANCE
NXP is helping global automakers transition 
their vehicle fleets from internal combustion engines to electric ones. Our smart solutions help manage the batteries that power hybrid 
and electric vehicles, resulting in higher overall efficiency. Our battery–management solutions can boost performance and extend the vehicle range of e–vehicles by 28%
3, while our 
platooning technology has been shown to deliver net fuel savings of up to 8%
4 in hybrids. What’s more, our battery–
management systems are supplemented by motor–control solutions that can increase fuel economy by up to 20%
5. 
 
INTELLIGENT EDGE – 
OPTIMIZING ENERGY THROUGH MACHINE LEARNING
Devices in our edge–processing portfolio for 
automotive, industrial, and IoT offer excellent power efficiency and long–lasting battery 
life. They’re designed to handle data processing and machine learning at the edge of the network, reducing energy required to transmit data for processing in the cloud. Our smallest microcontrollers consume as little as one microwatt
6 in certain 
standby conditions, which means they can provide years  of battery life. 
Optimizing energy use at the chip level is becoming an 
increasingly crucial part of designing energy–efficient edge systems. NXP’s innovative Energy Flex architecture, designed to extend battery life and reduce energy waste in portable and plugged–in devices, makes our latest processors even more energy efficient, using a unique combination of techniques, including heterogeneous domain processing and 28nm FD–SOI process technology.

ADVANCED V2X APPLICATION SCENARIOS 
FOR COLLISION–FREE DRIVING
Every year, more than 1.3 million 
people are killed in road accidents across the world, and more than 50% of those fatalities are cyclists, pedestrians, and motorcyclists. Technologies such as “Vehicle–to–Everything” (V2X) 
communication and driver–assistance systems can help significantly reduce these numbers and are already in standard use in select passenger cars today.
V2X technology can reduce road fatalities even further 
when it’s built into smart electric bicycles. To help protect cyclists, NXP and Riese & Müller built a prototype e–bike that can transmit information about its position, speed, and direction of travel to other V2X–enabled vehicles in the vicinity. In just seconds, the V2X module can calculate distances between the bike and other vehicles, as well as any changes in position. In the event of a dangerous situation between a bike and a car, both the cyclist and the driver would receive a timely collision warning. For more information can be found here.NXP in Action

ENERGY MANAGEMENT
Changing how we manage energy in residential and commercial spaces 
represents one of the most important opportunities to curb energy consumption and emissions. For example, we can save significant amounts of energy with air conditioning, heating, lighting, and other interior functions by deploying smart control systems that use real–time data to lower total energy consumption and adapt to human presence, activity, and preferences. Artificial intelligence can make these systems self–learning and more 
autonomous, reducing energy consumption even further. Our components and solutions help bring these ‘smart’ capabilities into homes, cities, and the energy infrastructure.
CONNECTING OUR WORLD – REDUCING ENERGY TO GO MORE PLACES
Reducing energy consumption is an important goal for the telecom infrastructure. Base stations for wireless communication transmit huge amounts of data over long distances, because the power amplifiers and antennas that enable transmission and reception typically consume many kilowatts of electric power per station and radiate energy.
In 2021, NXP achieved a major industry milestone for 5G energy efficiency with the integration of Gallium Nitride (GaN) technology into our multi–chip module platform, making us the first to announce RF solutions for 5G massive MIMO that combine the high efficiency of GaN with the compactness of multi–chip modules. These compact modules reduce power consumption while supporting wideband performance. The result is a very energy–efficient way to deliver more data to more places, in the shortest amount of time. The new portfolio will reduce the size and weight of radio units, and help the operators of mobile networks lower the cost of deploying 5G on cellular towers and rooftops.

Green Innovation Bond  TaxationEnterprise Risk ManagementBusiness ContinuityTAXATION 
NXP is a socially responsible company in the tax field devoted 
to sustainability and transparency. Since the company’s establishment as a standalone entity in 2006, NXP has been committed to complying with tax laws, including the intention of the laws, of the jurisdictions where we operate. Transparency and accountability regarding the taxes paid to governments are foundational aspects of sustainability. As such, we appreciate the importance our stakeholders assign to how NXP approaches and manages its tax obligations, and its disclosures regarding tax policies.
We currently detail NXP’s quantitative tax effects in our annual 
published financial documents. The voluntary disclosure of country–specific tax information is also being considered, in light of the recently announced EU directive on public country–by–country reporting. 
OUR APPROACH TO TAX
NXP follows a tax strategy that is sustainable, transparent, and fully aligned with well–known recognized international tax principles. The NXP Code of Conduct serves as an ethical framework for taxes, and is effectively embedded within the tax strategy and across the tax organization.
Our tax strategy — that is, the way we approach, manage, 
and assess the risk of taxation — is grounded in the corporate objective to act as a socially responsible company. We consider the purpose of tax regulation in a given jurisdiction and maintain strict adherence with applicable tax laws.
NXP aims to support stable, transparent, and predictable tax 
systems that incentivize long–term investment and economic growth. NXP’s tax structures are based on global standards and frameworks supported by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). We believe that operating within this framework creates a constant contribution to the advancement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations.
NXP’s taxation strategy is aligned with the businesses in 
each of the respective legal entities through which the company operates. We invest in research and development, manufacturing, and go–to–market activities using a cross–functional model, leveraged by multiple organizations globally. The resulting product development and extended supply chain form the basis for NXP’s transfer–pricing structure.
Considering our product–development framework, NXP 
leverages the available tax incentives and tax regulations in the various jurisdictions where it operates. The most important tax incentives NXP is eligible for are the ones that drive and promote innovation and R&D activities. For example, as a Dutch multinational focused on research and development, NXP qualifies for the innovation box regime provided by Dutch tax law. The regime reduces the nominal tax rate for qualified income associated with R&D from 25% to 9%. The effective Dutch tax rate for NXP is well above 15%.
NXP’S APPROACH TO TRANSFER PRICING
As a multinational enterprise, NXP operates in many different tax jurisdictions and frequently deals with intergroup transfers that involve cross–border payments within the group. To avoid potential tax issues with these internal, cross–border transactions, internal transfers use the same pricing structure as transfers coming from independent parties. This policy of using the same price for intergroup and independent transfers, in what’s known as “arm’s length transfer pricing,” ensures that all parties get a fair remuneration for the services they render.
NXP is fully committed to the Action Plan promoted by the 
OECD to prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS). In this sense, NXP does not have presence in black–listed jurisdictions as defined by the European Union and does not use artificial structures to achieve tax advantages or minimize tax liabilities. Moreover, NXP ensures its alignment with the arm’s length principle and other international tax principles by frequently benchmarking and comparing the transfer prices used intra–group with the prices set by independent parties in comparable situations. Lastly, to monitor current and emerging trends in the international tax field, regular meetings are held within the tax department to ensure we act appropriately  upon them.Compliant with all applicable

Green Innovation Bond  TaxationEnterprise Risk ManagementBusiness ContinuityTAX GOVERNANCE
Within NXP , the Tax department is led by a Senior Vice 
President (SVP), reporting directly to the Chief Financial Officer (CFO). The CFO is responsible for updating the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis, with support from the Tax department leadership. NXP reviews  and approves tax plans and targets annually, consistent  with industry–wide, best–in–class control and  governance frameworks.
The NXP Tax department is a centralized organization that 
manages both regional and functional requirements. The organization regularly engages with external tax advisors and/or local tax authorities to provide assurances that our tax obligations are properly, effectively, and correctly handled and also disclosed in the annual and quarterly reports. Furthermore, fact–based tax accounting and policy advice is available in a timely manner throughout NXP . 
RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION
NXP has a low appetite for tax risk. Nevertheless, NXP operates on a global basis, and is potentially exposed to numerous risks, including those related to taxation. When evaluating the acceptable risk limits for taxes, we apply critical and professional reasoning on an issue–by–issue basis. 
Within NXP’s global framework, we operate through regional 
and functional dimensions. This way of working ensures the identification and resolution of tax issues in a timely fashion. The tax team continuously monitors the processes for tax accounting, tax compliance, and reporting, so as to identify and manage potential risks. The team documents every stage of the process. In addition, NXP follows Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which are designed to support transparent financial reporting, and has implemented a robust, effective, and efficient tax–accounting control framework  that assures compliance with the US 2002  Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX). Potential violations of NXP’s tax policy can be confidentially reported using various reporting channels, such as management, an ethics liaison, the NXP Ethics Committee,   or can be submitted using the phone or web option of our SpeakUp line, a system hosted by an independent third party that facilitates anonymous reporting. A strict policy of non–retaliation is in force to protect any team member who reports potential violations.
ENGAGING WITH TAX AUTHORITIES 
AND STAKEHOLDERS
NXP is committed to open and transparent relationships with 
tax authorities. For all requests of information or audits, we provide the required documentation in a timely manner. NXP is also committed to fostering and maintaining long–term relationships, grounded on ethical integrity, collaboration, and mutual respect. One example of this is the fact that NXP participates in the Netherlands in a cooperative compliance program with the Dutch tax authorities.
In our willingness to engage with stakeholders and other 
entities, we participate in the annual Total Tax Contribution Project, a study of the largest companies in the EU, EFTA, and UK. We also provide feedback and insights to governments and international organizations, such as the OECD, from our perspective as a multinational corporation and a member of the semiconductor industry. 
LOOKING FORWARD 
In 2022, we are increasing our stakeholder engagement by joining the European Business Tax Forum. Our membership positions NXP to share our insight on responsible tax practices and transparency with a leading body of European businesses dedicated to raising the standards of the public tax debate.TAXATION

Green Innovation Bond  TaxationEnterprise Risk ManagementBusiness ContinuityENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT
Our management is directly responsible for executing our process for Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”), which helps us promptly identify, 
evaluate, prioritize, respond to, and manage material business risks impacting NXP’s strategic objectives. 
The objectives of our ERM process are to:  
•
  Enhance our understanding of risks acr

Key ERM activities include:RISK MANAGEMENT GOVERNANCE
The Board of Directors oversees NXP’s 
processes and procedures related to risk assessment and risk management, and reviews NXP’s top identified risks, while the NXP Management Team oversees, identifies, and manages the top risks NXP faces in executing its strategy, defines risk appetite, and manages risks accordingly. 
The ERM function enables NXP management 
to make risk management more efficient and effective by providing and maintaining a risk–management framework, a risk–monitoring mechanism and facilitating the execution of the ERM process. The framework includes a yearly risk assessment and  quarterly reviews.
MANAGING RISK ACCORDING TO 
OUR RISK APPETITE
We believe that our appetite for risk is 
consistent with that of our semiconductor peers, and a reflection of the semiconductor industry as a whole. Our risk appetite is different for the  identified risks and therefore the level of mitigation varies. For mitigation of the operational, financial disclosure, and compliance risk we rely on our framework of business controls, process, and authorizations. We also follow the Tone at the Top principle, which says that, when management upholds honesty, integrity, and ethics, team members are more likely to do the same. The top–down approach is especially relevant to the mitigation of more strategic risks.

NXP prepares and plans for interruptions affecting all or part of the organization so that  
we can minimize the effects of potential incidents and ensure the ability to continue  business operations.
Weathering the Austin Winter Storm Before, during, and after the unprecedented Winter Storm Uri, Corporate and Site teams met at least once a day to ensure worker and facility safety, coordinate with local government agencies, and achieve the fastest possible recovery of production. This helped reduce the overall impact of the storm and allowed NXP to restart full manufacturing operations in line with or faster than peer semiconductor companies.
Part of NXP’s Business Continuity Plan is to conduct regular system 
reviews and event debriefs, and share lessons learned with other locations, so that we can continuously improve. The events of 2021 prompted us to make changes in several areas, including winter–weather pre–planning, emergency power systems, internal communication processes, staffing models, response–equipment supplies, and documented procedures.All Hands–on Deck – COVID–19Corporate and Site Business Continuity Teams met weekly, or as situations dictated, to monitor developments and impacts related to COVID–19. They also coordinated assistance to NXP team members and monitored adherence to health and safety protocols, to assure worker protection and continuance of  
business operations. 
PLANS AND TEAMS
We conduct scenario planning to help minimize the potential effects of incidents that may impact all or part of the organization, and ensure NXP can continue operating safely and efficiently.
NXP’s Business Continuity Management Plan is inclusive of all NXP businesses, 
activities, and manufacturing  sites, and is modeled on the International Organization for Standardization’s ISO 22301 standard and the International Automotive Task Force’s IATF 16949 Section 6.1.2.3. For a detailed overview of NXP’s Business Continuity Plan, visit our website.
The Corporate and Site Business Continuity Teams consist of representatives from 
various business functions and organizations. Teams identify potential risks that can have a major impact on product availability, on supplies (such as wafers, chemicals and gases), on structures, manufacturing site tool–sets, facility systems, and utility infrastructure, as well as regional risks, including natural hazards. The teams are also responsible for strategic, tactical, and operational decisions while implementing their specific business–continuity plans. The Corporate team includes executive–level representatives who receive reports from individual Site teams with specific business–resumption activities. During an event, all groups interact with each other and, if necessary, issues are escalated to the Corporate team for additional assistance.

TRAINING AND TESTING 
Site teams conduct regular training and testing/drills. This builds awareness and spreads knowledge about how to handle disruptive events. Our manufacturing sites and  main design and office sites prepare for events using on–the–job training and/or site–developed trainings that cover key roles and how to handle site–specific scenarios.
Our sites conduct drills, at least annually, to test the 
effectiveness of the continuity plan for a wide range of potential disruptions. This includes interruptions caused by equipment failures, externally provided products, processes, and services, natural disasters, fires, utility interruptions, or labor shortages, and infrastructure disruptions, including IT issues and cyber–attacks. NOTIFICATION
Site–level and community–level emergency alerts notify us if there are chemical spills, fires, earthquakes, typhoons, floods, explosions, and other events so responses can begin quickly, at the site, local and/or regional level. We also have a geographic information system that includes the latitudes and longitudes of the manufacturing locations of our various suppliers. Teams receive emails whenever events happen, and this immediately triggers a due–diligence assessment and an action–planning process. We reach out to manufacturing sites and vendors in the proximity of an emergency, and if there may be an impact to our supply continuity, we take mitigation actions. Proactive and timely communication with our customers is part of  this response.BUSINESS CONTINUITY MANAGEMENT

Ethics Anti-Bribery and CorruptionPrivacyCybersecurityMost reported violation types included theft, conflict of  
interest and harassment.
NXP emphasizes making decisions which are ethical, never 
engaging in corruption, bribery, or insider trading, and avoiding conflicts of interest. We also aim to compete in an ethical and lawful manner, comply with international trade regulations, practice transparency, and maintain accurate business records. To protect our company’s reputation, we have policies related to these and many other topics, and we expect everyone who works for NXP to comply with these guidelines.
CODE OF CONDUCT
NXP’s Code of Conduct (the Code) sets out the principles that guide us as we work to fulfill our ambitions as a responsible and ethical company. It serves as a framework and details the behavior expected from every team member, director, contractor, or anyone else who works on behalf of NXP . The Code is available in 12 languages and can be found on www.NXP .com or the NXP intranet.ETHICS 
The Code addresses business and personal integrity, use of company assets, employment at NXP , external activities, and provides guidance on reporting potential violations. Updates to the Code in 2021 focused on data protection, trade compliance, and added artificial intelligence. The updated Code was communicated to all team members through an email, an introduction video, and an article on our company intranet. Team members were required to acknowledge receipt and understood the Code. To incorporate the Code into our way of working, we train our team members on principles of the Code.
ETHICS TRAINING
In November 2021, the annual Code of Conduct training was rolled out to our team members. The training was offered in 12 languages and, focused on NXP values and expectations as set forth in our Code. The 2021 training addressed several topics, including anti–bribery and corruption, conflicts of interest, (sexual) harassment, and speaking up at NXP . Team members were required to acknowledge receipt and understanding of the Code. A test is part of the training and a 100% score is required for completion and certification.  
NXP’s goal is 100% completion by all enrolled individuals. At 
the time this report was prepared, we achieved a completion rate of 97.9%. Since the training window opened at the end of the year, we did not yet reach our 100% completion rate. In 2022, we will determine whether those who did not complete the training yet should be given an exemption, for instance because of long–term sick leave or maternity/paternity leave. We will continue to work towards a 100% completion rate.

Ethics Anti-Bribery and CorruptionPrivacyCybersecurityALLEGATIONS APPROACH AND MANAGEMENT
All reports are assessed and discussed by the NXP Ethics 
Committee. After the initial assessment of a report, an investigation team is appointed with the right expertise and skill set to conduct an in–depth investigation. Based on the findings of the investigation, a decision is made about whether the report can be substantiated. If so, we take appropriate follow–up actions. These actions can include education, organizational changes, counseling, reprimand, suspension, and/or termination, depending on the nature and severity of the finding and the party’s willingness and ability to rectify the issue. While it is difficult to set a fixed timetable for resolution, since complaints vary in scale and complexity, most can be dealt with in under two months. ETHICS COMMITTEE
The NXP Ethics Committee reviews reports and grievances and oversees investigations into alleged violations of the Code. The Ethics Committee consists of six senior leaders from Legal, Internal Audit, Human Resources, and Sustainability. Members are based in the Americas, Europe and Asia–Pacific regions. The Ethics Committee meets bi–weekly to discuss all reports received and to monitor the progress of ongoing investigations. The Ethics Committee reports quarterly to the General Counsel, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Human Resources Officer, and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors regarding allegations and investigations that are in progress or completed.

We are committed to promoting a culture of integrity, and encourage our team members, as well as external business partners and third parties, to express any concerns they have related to potential 
violations of the Code, NXP policies, or the law.  Concerns and grievances can be confidentially lodged using various reporting channels, such as management, ethics liaisons, or the NXP Ethics Committee. There are dedicated ethics liaisons regionally and in each country. Concerns and grievances can also be submitted using the phone or web option of SpeakUp, a system hosted by an independent third party that facilitates anonymous reporting. Team members are encouraged to report potential violations of our Code using any of our reporting channels. 
Our SpeakUp reporting channels are communicated to all 
team members through our Code, dedicated intranet web pages, trainings, our website, and various other means. SpeakUp can be used by any employee, contractor, business partner, stakeholder, or other third party.
All concerns raised are taken seriously. We apply the highest 
standards of confidentiality in the handling of all reports received. We have a strict non–retaliation policy to protect those who report concerns and grievances. Anyone who reports a concern in good faith are protected from retaliation in the form of harassment or adverse employment or career consequences.
In recent years, we have increased our communication about 
the importance of speaking up, and the available reporting channels. We have seen an increase in reports, indicating that our reporting channels are effective.0800–1693502

Ethics Anti-Bribery and CorruptionPrivacyCybersecurityAt NXP , we value integrity, transparency and professionalism when dealing with customers, 
suppliers, government officials, and other third parties. It is our policy to compete fairly and engage in business practices that comply with the anti–bribery and corruption laws and regulations that apply to NXP , such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) in the United States, and the Anti–Bribery Act 2010 in the United Kingdom (“UKBA”). 
We take a zero–tolerance approach to any form of bribery and corruption, regardless of 
the identity or position of the originator or recipient of the bribe. Bribes, other improper or unauthorized payments, and acts that create the appearance of promising, offering, giving or authorizing such payments are not tolerated. 
This applies to all of our team members, directors, officers and organizations, and third 
parties acting on behalf of NXP , and to all transactions in any country where we operate and do (or seek to do) business. Any violation is deemed a serious violation of our Code and will lead to disciplinary action. 
AN EFFECTIVE ANTI–BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION (ABC) POLICY 
In 2021, to measure the effectiveness of the ABC Policy, NXP worked with academic researchers to measure the effectiveness of three different versions of the NXP ABC Policy. 
Study participants included more than 1,500 team members from Sales, Procurement, 
Marketing, and Management, working in multiple jurisdictions. Participants were divided into four groups. Each group was given either a Long Policy, a Short–Law Policy, a Short–Designed Policy or, in the case of the control group, No Policy.  
The goal was to identify which version of the policy was most effective in regards to:
•
 Building knowledge in r
elation to anti–bribery and corrupt practices, 
•
 Per
cept ion of social norms relating to anti–bribery and corruption, 
•
  Behavioral situations in which bribery and corruption risks must be consider
ed according 
to our ABC Policy.
Results of the study will help NXP select the most effective version of the ABC Policy.

Ethics Anti-Bribery and CorruptionPrivacyCybersecurityKeeping track of private data is essential in today’s world. NXP recognizes the importance of 
protecting the personal data that we have in our possession. We respect the privacy of everyone involved in doing business for or with NXP , and take appropriate steps to protect personal data. We take principles such as data minimization and purpose limitation serious.
Data breaches are unfortunate, and can have a significant impact on individuals and 
corporations alike. Proper data management makes data breaches easier to detect, and helps with damage control. NXP’s policies require that we promptly record and respond to data breaches. Where required by law, we also reports data breaches to the relevant authorities.  
PRIVACY POLICIES
NXP has a Privacy Policy and a Privacy Statement. The Privacy Policy includes information on Privacy and Data Protection guidelines and regulations. The Privacy Statement describes our processing activities, individual’s rights, and how those rights can be exercised, and require that we promptly respond to inquiries relating to data, including requests to delete personal information. Other guidelines relating to privacy include our Data Breach and Data Retention policies. 
GOVERNANCE
We take measures to ensure that third parties who process personal data on our behalf do so in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. We conclude Data Processing Agreements and – in case of data transfers – put in place data transfer mechanisms, such as standard contractual clauses. To ensure these agreements are entered into correctly, we have a Privacy Focus Team, which consists of Commercial Legal Counsels and  Privacy Officers. MONITORING
To keep a record of processing activities, we use OneTrust, a tool that helps us map the data we process as a company. We also have Privacy Champions who ensure that the processing activities they identify are mapped into OneTrust. Located throughout the organization, Privacy Champions align with the Privacy Team on privacy matters that occur in their organization. 
TRAINING
Privacy Champions receive monthly training on general privacy topics and the use of the OneTrust tool. There is also a general privacy training available for all NXP team members. Departments that deal with aspects of Data Protection and Privacy in their day–to–day activities receive additional training from  the Privacy Team.
CYBERSECURITY
In 2021, we conducted a survey to evaluate potential risks that could affect our business, 
and cybersecurity was identified as a focus topic from an ESG perspective. In response to this feedback, we added cybersecurity to our Corporate Sustainability Report, replicating cybersecurity information provided in other external documentation.  
OUR APPROACH
As a leading technology company, we are committed to helping strengthen internet security,  and to implement measures that protect our company against illicit activities, including cyberattacks and malware. 
On a day–to–day basis, NXP identifies vulnerabilities, breach attempts, and possible criminal 
activity by third parties. These activities are covered by our process for cybersecurity risk management. To date, we have experienced no cybersecurity incidents that resulted in any material adverse effect to our business or operations.
GOVERNANCE
NXP’s Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of NXP’s governance and management of Information Technology (IT) risks, including those relating to business continuity, cybersecurity, malware, regulatory compliance, and data management. NXP senior leadership regularly briefs the Audit Committee on cybersecurity matters and briefs the full Board on these issues at least annually. 
NXP’s program for IT Risk Management is a component of NXP’s overall process for Enterprise 
Risk Management. NXP’s Chief Information Security Officer manages the cybersecurity risks identified in the Enterprise Risk Management process. This includes performing an initial risk assessment, prioritizing the most likely and impactful risk elements, and recommending appropriate measures to mitigate the risk. CERTIFICATIONS
NXP is certified and externally audited to ISO 27001 with certain additional certifications such as Common Criteria 6+, PCI DSSm and GSMA Security for focused functions. We also maintain insurance coverage for cybersecurity risk. 
TRAINING
We offer a number of training initiatives as part of our program for cybersecurity training and compliance. The NXP IT Service Desk, along with all NXP team members, are trained to identify cybersecurity issues and to escalate them to correct owners. We deploy simulated attacks and related trainings at least quarterly. We deliver a cybersecurity orientation to all of our new  team members, and maintain a library of cybersecurity learning sessions that is available  to all team members.
MONITORING
We use a multi–layer approach to identify and mitigate information security risks. On a tactical level, we maintain a 24x7 Security Operating Center that actively monitors for and identifies cybersecurity threats and initiates appropriate mitigation processes. The Security Operating Center reports to the Chief Information Security Officer. When handling high–severity security incidents, we create a Computer Security Incident Response Team. If a potential threat or risk is elevated, we establish a task force with representatives from Security, IT, Communications, Legal, and businesses to lead mitigation activities.

GoalsGovernance42 As a company focused on innovation, we are known for our ability to solve 
problems and address societal challenges, and we are proud of the progress we’ve made since our founding in 2006 regarding our environment, social and governance (ESG) performance. 
We recognize that stakeholder interest and expectations regarding our ESG 
efforts have evolved considerably over the last fifteen years. Employees, governments, shareholders, and other stakeholders have enthusiastically embraced ESG as a way of strengthening corporate accountability  and transparency.
Since our founding, NXP has experienced considerable growth and evolved 
dramatically as a company. At the same time, we have continued to advance the scope of our ESG efforts to align with new challenges and opportunities. Today, we are focused on integrating ESG into our business and leveraging our technology to enable a more sustainable world. 
We continue to build on our ESG accomplishments. For example, we are 
committed to ensuring a safe and healthy workplace for our team members, partners, and visitors, and in 2021, our injury rates remained among  the industry’s lowest.
Another way we address ESG is by focusing on our carbon footprint. We 
have achieved significant reductions in emissions for each year we’ve been in business, even as production has increased. For the past 11 years, we have also increased our consumption of renewable energy.
Since 2013, our Social Responsibility team has worked diligently to eliminate 
human–rights abuses at NXP and in our supply chain. The team was recognized in 2016 when the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the largest international multimedia news provider, awarded NXP with the Stop Slavery Award in the “Policy and Implementation” category. The award was the first global recognition for businesses that have excelled in efforts to limit the risk of forced labor from their supply chains.
In our view, the rapid pace of technological change is not without its 
challenges, but we look to the future with optimism. We believe in furthering our legacy of sustainable innovation, and will continue to apply our technologies in ways that help advance global sustainability. We embrace the opportunity to inspire people and shape the future while also positioning ourselves for sustained success.

DRIVING TEAM MEMBER ENGAGEMENT
Insights from our survey equip us to improve the team member experience and work on our 
policies and processes. We’ve converted some team member feedback into company and/or country–specific programs and made updates to our tools and resources. This includes focusing on the well–being of our team members and introducing global flexible work arrangements.
To ensure consistent support for the physical, mental and overall well–being of our team 
members, we introduced a focused initiative across the globe. Each month of the year was defined by a well–being theme that was further explained and demonstrated through internal communications, team–building activities, and in–country celebrations, among other things. Results from a mid–year well–being poll showed that most team members found NXP’s focus on well–being to be “just right”, and requested more coverage on topics like health/wellness and general work/life balance.
To help team member achieve greater work/life balance and offer support, we incorporated 
flexibility into our way of working, allowing qualified team members to work a combination of onsite and from home. To participate, team members follow a defined process for their respective country. This new way of working offers a positive benefit to team members,  while still supporting our collaborative style and allowing for constructive and meaningful  social interactions.
LOOKING FORWARD
In February 2022, we launched the 2022 Winning Culture Survey. The survey invites input from our indirect labor (IDL) population and introduces a new category focused on diversity, equality and inclusion to support our goal of creating a more inclusive environment and furthering a sense of belonging at NXP . We look forward to continued strong participation, as evidenced with our end of 2020 survey (where all–team member participation was 90%) and fall 2019 (where IDL participation was 83%).
After a thorough review of the 2022 results, the CEO, CHRO and members of the management 
team will determine the top priority focus area(s) for NXP . Each level of management in the organization will identify and act upon specific plans based on survey feedback and dialogue with their team members. Results and actions from the 2022 Winning Culture Survey will be discussed with the Board of Directors in June 2022.

We are committed to building thought leaders, which is 
evidenced by nearly 9,300 team members (representing 31% of our IDL workforce) who are specifically dedicated to R&D. Through broad exposure to job–based development activities, we have been able to advance 11% of these team members in 2021 through internal promotions. In addition, we hired 1,523 new R&D team members, named 26 technical directors, seven program directors and four new fellows. 
To enable in–depth analysis of the current R&D workforce 
baseline for our strategic R&D workforce planning, we updated our R&D job structure with more defined job descriptions and specific skill domains. R&D team members are being transitioned into the new job profiles, so we can better  assess and develop the skills and capabilities of these  team members across NXP .
To further develop the R&D community, we launched the NXP 
R&D Academy, offering a variety of learning opportunities. We have dedicated development programs in the areas of architecture, functional safety, design quality, crypto and security. In 2021, we had nearly 3,400 team members attend either the NXP Architecture and System Engineering (ASE) School or the NXP Safety Academy. 
The NXP Architecture and System Engineering (ASE) School 
was created to help nurture and develop top technical experts, architects and systems engineers to deliver top–rated hardware and software solutions per the current market demands. Ultimately, the ASE School offers exposure to the latest industry technology trends through enriching technical sessions and thought–provoking workshops led by internal experts and selected external partners. The desired result is a technical talent pool that is effective in their current role and future roles as Architectural or System Engineers.   
The NXP Safety Academy helps team members explore safety 
products and enablement collateral to simplify ISO 26262 compliance, understand safety deliverables and how they can help accelerate time to market. Four different on–demand learning paths have been defined to give team members the opportunity to gain expertise to more quickly design safety–critical automotive applications.  
In addition, we offer trainings and regular webinars, allowing 
our R&D community to grow their knowledge and stay up to date with the latest developments and innovations. For example:
•
 W
e hosted the 2XP , a session that allows NXP experts to 
share their work and latest insights with their peers. In 
2021, there were 32 sessions that brought together more than 3,600 attendees.   
•
 In India, we intr
oduced a dedicated program to grow 
Technical Leadership. In 2021, we had 81 team members participate, 31 of which were part of a mentoring program that paired them with technical leaders in the company.   
•
 The NXP R&D Academy will further expand in the coming
 
years with additional schools on artificial intelligence, SoC development and ideation. 
In addition, NXP created a dedicated R&D Project 
Management (PM) Academy, including PM leadership training and PM mentoring – collectively, these sessions had more than 45 participants in 2021. Looking ahead to 2022, we intend to introduce a PM masterclass and setup for certification. 
Our new product introduction (NPI) projects have become 
more and more complex, requiring large investment as well as successful, timely and efficient completion. Our PM talent is vital to our ability to drive these projects to completion, hence NXP has placed greater focus to further invest in skilled and capable project leaders. Our consistent focus on R&D and innovation resulted in NXP being awarded more than 1,150 individual patents during 2021.BUILDING THOUGHT LEADERSHIP

EMBRACING DIVERSITY, EQUALITY, AND INCLUSION
At NXP , we value diversity, equality and inclusion, and respect 
the unique talents, experiences, backgrounds, cultures and ideas of our team members. We invite everyone to be their authentic selves at work, without exception. This is what makes us who we are at NXP . As an ongoing demonstration of our commitment, we invest in initiatives and resources to drive cultural awareness across the company, spearheaded by our Head of Diversity, Equality and Inclusion (DE&I).      
NXP made significant progress on our DE&I journey in 2021. 
We started the year with increased transparency of our team member demographics by communicating our global gender and United States race and ethnicity representation data in our 2020 Corporate Sustainability Report, and defined internal goals to increase representation over time. Additionally, our Head of DE&I met with each member of our Management Team, as well as the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors to discuss the 2021 DE&I strategy and plans. Our progress toward our representation goals was regularly reviewed with these leaders throughout the year.
To help define our aspirational and interim representation 
goals, we developed a tool to analyze our representation results in comparison to our hiring and attrition trends, and developed internal dashboards to help track progress  towards our goals.
When it comes to hiring, we began requiring diverse candidate 
slates for management roles and increased our Employee Referral Program award amounts when qualified women or, in the United States, under–represented minorities, are hired via  a referral for positions in specific countries.To gain a better understanding of what’s contributing to the attrition of women globally and minority team members within the United States, we implemented an exit interview process where team members at specified job levels are given the opportunity to provide direct feedback to the Head of DE&I prior to exiting the company. 
Additionally, we participated in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for the first time to demonstrate our commitment to promoting gender equality, and an inclusive workplace,  to help establish a comparable data set within our industry.  
We also announced our global Diversity, Equality and Inclusion Policy to the company, and increased our DE&I communications and programming, including the launch of Inclusion Insights – a new practice of starting our formal meetings with a brief discussion focused on inclusion, regular contributions to our weekly company–wide newsletter, and through our Inclusive Language Project and Employee Resource Group (ERG) engagement activities.
We increased our ERG footprint by establishing a new chapter 
of Equal – our LGBTQ ERG in Europe and created two new ERGs: No eXtra Planet (which focuses on environmental sustainability) and Interconnection (which supports team members in Europe from multicultural backgrounds).

EMBRACING DIVERSITY, EQUALITY, AND INCLUSION
In a competitive hiring market, our overall team member population grew by nearly 8% 
compared to 2020. Of this increased population, with the exception of the representation of women in executive positions, we saw a 1% increase for each of the goals in 2021 when compared to 2020. While we present gender representation headcount (HC) data by men and women, we acknowledge this is not fully encompassing of all gender identities.  
GENDER REPRESENTATION 
At NXP , women represent 37% of our global workforce (up 1% year over year), and we continue to strive for noticeable improvements in hiring women across all global sites. Additionally, we are committed to increasing, developing, and promoting more women into technical and leadership positions within our organizations.  
To that end, we monitor gender statistics globally, across all roles, and look for continuous 
improvements, which include an evaluation of the practices at the country level. Each country leadership team focuses on how to ensure we are making improvements, where needed. 0%25%50%75%100%

RACE AND ETHNICITY REPRESENTATION
In the United States, we monitor race and ethnicity representation to ensure we are attracting, 
retaining and developing diverse team members, acknowledging the unique nature of the United States workforce dynamics.  
A breakdown of NXP’s United States population, as of December 31, 2021: 
Race and Ethnicity (United States Only) Representation
White (Not Hispanic or Latino) 51%
Asian (Not Hispanic or Latino) 20%
Hispanic or Latino 15%
Undeclared 7%
Black or African American (Not Hispanic or Latino) 5%
Two or More Races (Not Hispanic or Latino) 1%
Native American or Alaska Native (Not Hispanic or Latino) 0.6%
Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (Not Hispanic or Latino) 0.2%POLICY 
In 2021, NXP announced our global Diversity, Equality and Inclusion Policy , which 
outlines our key belief that every team member should be treated with respect. We 
do not tolerate discrimination based on race, national origin, social origin, color, gender, religion, age, pregnancy, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability, or political affiliation, among other things. Nor do tolerate physical, verbal, sexual or psychological harassment, bullying, abuse, or threats of any kind.  
We are committed to providing an inclusive working environment for our team 
members, and we recruit, hire, and promote solely based on suitability for the job, and objective and non–discriminatory criteria. By working to foster a diverse, equal, and inclusive environment where everyone feels welcomed, valued, and accepted as they are, we increase collaboration, advance innovation, and enable our team members to unlock their full potential. 
ENGAGING OUR TEAMS THROUGH INCLUSION INSIGHTS 
Culture change happens over time, and it requires intent and observed behavioral changes. As NXP looks to foster a more inclusive culture within the company on a global scale, inclusion must be a demonstrated part of our day–to–day activities. 
As such, NXP launched Inclusion Insights to embed inclusive practices throughout our 
company every day. An inclusion insight is a one–to–five–minute exchange about a specific inclusion topic at the beginning of a meeting. They are intended to serve as regular reminders to each of us about the importance of being inclusive at work, at home and in all aspects of our lives. 
Expected outcomes include better engagement, increased collaboration, high 
performance and innovation. Inclusion creates an environment in which all team members feel welcomed, valued, accepted, respected and included, and enables everyone to perform at their best.

The center of our diversity, equality and inclusion approach is to give team members a voice and engage them to help drive our focus in this important space.    
NXP’s Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) enable our culture and inclusive work environment, as we work to ensure diversity throughout our company, and bring unique perspectives and skills to 
help those in our communities.  
In 2021 we increased our ERG footprint by establishing a new chapter of Equal - our LGBTQ ERG - in Europe and created two new ERGs: No eXtra Planet (which focuses on environmental 
sustainability) and Interconnection (which supports team members in Europe from multicultural backgrounds). We now have eight primary ERGs, with representation in Asia, Europe, Mexico and the United States.

our LGBTQ ERG
Membership and participation in ERGs are open to all NXP team members, and global 
engagement is encouraged. Each ERG has defined mission/vision statements, goals, and executive oversight and sponsorship. To track the progress of our growing ERGs, we measure membership, team member engagement and programming for each group. In 2021, the ERGs collectively hosted more than 160 events, including professional development workshops, networking sessions and cultural awareness activities.
In addition to planning events and organizing efforts within the countries and regions in which 
they operate, NXP ERGs identify ways to partner across geographic sites and teams. An example of this collaborative effort is the company’s annual observation of International Women’s Day (IWD), which celebrates the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women. In 2021, thousands of NXP team members around the world participated in more than 50 virtual and on–site IWD events. Additional annual observances celebrated by our ERGs include Black History Month, Pride Month and Hispanic Heritage Month.
When possible, our ERGs also partner with external organizations committed to advancing STEM 
education, community wellness and sustainable environmental practices. For example, in 2021 our ERGs partnered with: To promote recruiting from diverse talent pipelines, our ERGs collaborate with our internal  Talent Acquisition team. For example, NXP’s Black Achievement Leadership Team developed  a career exploration workshop to provide guidance, support and early access to tools, tips  and NXP resources to National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) chapters at target  colleges and universities. 
Throughout 2021, our ERGs supported recruiting efforts with:
 
 
DEVELOPING OUR DIVERSE WORKFORCE 
Through our ERGs, NXP regularly facilitates training on diversity, equality and inclusion topics. As 
an example, Women in NXP and EQUAL ERGs collaborated on a LGBTQ allyship workshop for team members in India. These ERG–led sessions give our global team members the opportunity to engage in open discussions and create awareness of inclusive behaviors. 
Furthermore, our ERGs host events aimed at promoting career development and building 
leadership skills. For instance, YOUNG! NXP the Netherlands, hosted a meet and greet with NXP President and CEO Kurt Sievers, where they discussed authentic leadership and career growth. Also in 2021, our ERGs welcomed more than 30 external speakers and organizations for professional development and networking events.
In addition, NXP engages in professional development conferences that enables the continued 
growth of our diverse workforce. Over the last nine years, NXP team members have participated in the Texas Conference for Women, the Watermark Conference for Women, the Arizona Women’s Conference, and the Global Semiconductor Alliance’s Women’s Leadership Initiative.
We also created an internal resource hub to provide resources on topics such as diversity, 
inclusion, intercultural collaboration, microaggressions, bias, and allyship. 
To further foster an equal and inclusive culture, in 2022, we are integrating unconscious bias 
training into our team member development process. EMBRACING DIVERSITY, EQUALITY, AND INCLUSION

PROVIDING COMPETITIVE AND FAIR COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS
NXP’s competitive compensation and benefits programs are designed to attract the best 
talent, and drive the best performance across all areas of our diverse workforce.
 
COMPENSATION
NXP provides team members with total reward packages consisting of base salary, short– term incentives, and equity–based long–term incentives for some team members, as well  as competitive benefits aimed at supporting team members’ financial, physical, and  mental well–being.
Rewarding performance is a critical foundation for our overall program. NXP is committed 
to managing all reward–based compensation programs, including merit increases, annual incentive program (AIP) payouts, and long–term incentive awards, to deliver on our pay–for–performance philosophy. 
NXP has policies and procedures in place to promote pay equity, and diligent reviews are 
performed twice a year alongside the rewards processes. We also developed a proactive process to evaluate each reward–based compensation program in real–time, and provide leaders with feedback to ensure fair and equitable compensation. We continue to use analytical tools, to assess potential compensation recommendations that need further review prior to these recommendations becoming effective, in order to make appropriate adjustments and promote pay equity. We use this process globally to evaluate compensation–related decisions based on a variety of factors, including gender and, in the United States,  race and ethnicity. 
NXP relies on third–party data to establish fair, equitable and competitive compensation 
and benefits programs. We then empower leaders to recognize both individual and team accomplishments through a variety of compensation programs. Reward decisions are linked to a team member’s performance evaluation. A formal assessment of both specific achievements, and the individual’s demonstrated behaviors – consistent with our values – to deliver those achievements, is performed annually.

In some countries, we also support part–time 
work schedules, helping to support the overall well–being, and greater work–life balance for our team members. 
NXP believes our team members are the most 
important resource we have and supporting team members with our total rewards program is one of the reasons we remain successful against our competitors.

Certain sites also offer on–site health centers and designated areas for sporting activities and religious practices. NXP supports cultural events with gifts and time off for Diwali, Dragon Boat Festival and Chinese New Year.
NXP has a long history of empowering our team members to develop their skill sets and expand their capabilities.  
We have a strong commitment to continuous learning, and we understand that development happens when multiple learning 
approaches come together. By utilizing the 70/20/10 model, learning can achieve new levels through experience,  collaboration, and education.
OUR APPROACH  
ENABLING TALENT DEVELOPMENT & GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES 
Learning through on–the–job experience (70%) – begins on day one with orientation, and continues throughout 
employment with regular and ongoing programs for the growth and development of our talent, offered at both the local and global level. We work to create developmental opportunities for our team members through stretch assignments, project roles, cross–functional interactions, cross–geography engagements, and both temporary and longer–term job rotations. All of which are used to stimulate core skill and leadership competency development, provide on–the–job learning experience, and fuel the career growth of our team members.  
70%
Learning through others (20%) – we believe some of the best career learnings are gained by working with others and through on–the–job work experience. Learning new skill sets from the industry’s best is both a foundational learning strategy, and an opportunity we use at NXP to develop talent. There are many programs our team members can use to build relationships with peers and mentors and enhance team member development.
20%
Learning through education (10%) – is a vital tool blending internally designed and externally sourced courses and learning resources to provide learning opportunities to our team members, in support of key business processes, requirements and initiatives. We also provide a complete library of on–demand skills development and micro learning resources to all team members. We support continuing educational endeavors by providing tuition assistance programs in various countries – like China, India, the United Kingdom, and the United States, among others – where we cover a portion of the costs for team members to pursue degrees and/or certifications in approved fields of study.

CODE OF CONDUCT
NXP is committed to being an ethical company and a responsible business partner and 
employer. Therefore, it is important that everyone who works for NXP understands and adheres to the values and principles reflected in the Code of Conduct (the Code), and incorporates them in our day–to–day activities.   In 2021, we revamped our Code to reflect the changing circumstances of the dynamic industry in which we operate. In addition to making the Code more accessible, we have also increased the focus on relevant topics, including trade compliance, data compliance and added artificial intelligence to the Code. We also share information on how team members can report  potential violations, anonymously if so desired, via NXP’s SpeakUp line, hosted by an independent third–party.   All reported cases are taken seriously and are brought to the attention of the NXP Ethics Committee, which is comprised of senior leaders from Legal, Internal Audit, Human Resources and Sustainability. Members are based in the Americas, Europe and Asia–Pacific, who are independent from the people/business involved in any reported cases. Investigations are carried out in a confidential manner and communication is limited to those with a need to know.   The investigation team shares its findings with the NXP Ethics Committee, and subsequently, the Ethics Committee works together with the relevant business owners on follow–up actions, if any. Each quarter the Ethics Committee reports to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on all reports and investigations.LEARNING & DEVELOPMENT NEWSLETTER

NXP also partners in some countries with external institutions 
and entities to professionally develop our team members. For example, in France, we engage 500 – 600 team members in external training each year, equating to 10,000 to 12,000 training hours. The type of training varies from extensive training for team members engaged in an apprenticeship  with our company, to highly technical content training, to  soft skills content.
Our customers are key to what we do, and we value 
collaborating externally as a way of sharing our expertise with our customers and design partners, but also as a development opportunity for our own team members. We host and engage regularly in external training, conferences and other industry events that help us stay connected with the growth of the industry, and ensure our talent maintains cutting–edge and competitive knowledge and skills. In 2021, we engaged with more than 65,000 customers in 394 unique sessions across the globe, totaling 430 hours of training. 
LOOKING FORWARD
As we look ahead to 2022, we aim to continue increasing the professional growth and development opportunities for team members through the Manager Effectiveness Program. This program creates a consistent management culture at NXP through expected leadership behaviors that are designed to champion a safe, engaging and inclusive environment that provides our teams with a focused purpose and prioritized outcomes. Through this program, we aim to increase manager effectiveness by using the established enterprise development resources, and country best practices.

UNIVERSITY PARTNERSHIPS AND ENGAGEMENT
Through our partnerships with universities across the world, we fund and support advanced research programs and projects that demonstrate our commitment to investing in the future of not only 
technology, but also the students’ knowledge and skills. Quite often, these partnerships translate into new and exciting solutions for our customers.
  
  
To drive deeper awareness and engagement with our university partnerships, NXP created a University Relations Council, whose goal is to drive a coherent and aligned approach towards university partnerships by linking recruitment, global sales and marketing, and R&D programs.
Our 2021 university funding and support was diverse, and allowed us to support advanced research programs and sponsorships, including the following:  
~80 university projects: in countries across the globe, including Austria, 
Belgium, Czechia, France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, among others, led by NXP , with support from most business lines and functions.  
EcoCar: a US Department of Energy program, allowed NXP to work 
with 12 universities across the United States to develop more economic, environmentally friendly, and connected vehicles. NXP looks forward to the final’s ceremony and the selection of winners in 2022. 
2021 NXP Cup: invites participants to an autonomous robotics and 
automotive challenge. Participants design and build a car, design the software program, and race a pro–level autonomous car against other teams while aiming for the fastest time and precise maneuvering. The  2021 virtual event engaged more than 100 university teams in Europe.  The virtual and live finals event drew more than 3,000 views on YouTube. +70 projects with the Semiconductor Research Consortium (SRC): projects engaged NXP liaisons in Canada and the United States with university professors and students on advanced silicon design, production, and manufacturing processes. In addition, these programs provided students with a path for technology transfer and expertise for the industry.
2021 NXP Hover Games 2 Challenge: incorporate NXP technology in drones to help others during an emergency. We engaged more than 630 participants, 30% were students, with strong participation from India and the United States.
2021 NXP Smart Car Race Design Challenge: the Indian engineering student community focused two days on artificial intelligence in mobility, where students were invited to showcase and race their driverless car prototypes on a virtual racetrack, using skills in the areas of coding, AI algorithms, sign recognition, sensor, motion detection camera vision, image processing and more. More than 620 registered for the event from more than 24 states and 87 universities. Seventeen teams of 57 students were short–listed for the two–day grand finale of live races, with an in–depth evaluation from external judges. INVESTING IN FUTURE TALENT

UNIVERSITY AMBASSADOR PROGRAM
As we’ve engaged virtually with universities throughout the 
pandemic, we’ve learned that students seek connections within our company that go beyond the recruiting team. 
To facilitate these interactions, NXP created the NXP University 
Ambassador Program, inviting all team members to help raise awareness at universities to inspire and encourage young professionals to join NXP . As a University Ambassador, team members can connect with potential student hires in a variety of ways, such as speaking at job fairs, hosting guest lectures at universities, and engaging with students who are interested in getting hands–on experience through our internship program. In addition, students can reach out directly to our University Ambassadors through campaigns organized by NXP . There is a direct benefit to those participating, and we have found both students and ambassadors to be enriched. NEW–IN–CAREER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
At NXP , we believe that the success of our team members who are new in their career significantly drives the future success of our company. The first months of a new job can seem daunting. With this in mind, we developed a global, self–paced program focused on supporting emerging professionals in their transition to the professional world.
The aim of the New–in–Career Development Program is to 
provide our team members who are new in their career with the necessary knowledge and tools to understand more about NXP , our strategy, culture, and values. In addition, team members receive guidance on developing the professional skills they will need to successfully drive their development and reach their career goals.CUSTOMIZED COUNTRY–SPECIFIC PROGRAMS  
FOR FUTURE TALENT
NXP empowers our leaders and teams to create and launch 
programs that target the individual and specific needs of future talent in a specific country or region. Our Campus Connect Program in India allows NXP to reach out to university faculty and students to share a technical overview of current topics of interest in the semiconductor, electronics, and embedded system design sector (hardware/software). The program aims to provide opportunities for academia, through multiple focused tracks of technical webinars, hackathons, and proof–of–concept solutions, to solve current problems, and create a partnership between the brightest talents at college and experienced industry experts. Ultimately, the program helps pave the way forward for a seamless transition  into their career.

In 2021, workplaces across the globe were met with the challenge of team member turnover, 
with terms like “The Great Resignation” and/or “The Big Quit” to describe the economic trend that showed itself via mass voluntary resignations.
While it’s true that NXP saw a year–over–year increase in team member turnover, we also saw 
voluntary turnover stabilize in March, and have remained relatively flat, and since down over the second half of 2021 versus the first half of 2021. To address our concerns, we launched several initiatives centered around retention actions for strategic roles and top–performing talent, as well as programs targeting all team members, including the following:
•
 Global flexible 
work arrangements: Taking lessons from COVID–19, the company 
incorporated flexibility into our work style, allowing qualified team members to work a 
combination of onsite and from home. Participating team members follow a defined process for their respective country. This new way of working offers a positive benefit to team members, while still supporting our collaborative style, and allowing for constructive and meaningful social interactions.
•
 Continuous focus on well–being: 
To ensure consistent support for the physical, mental, 
and overall well–being of our team members, we introduced a focused initiative across the globe. Each month of the year was defined by a well–being theme that was further explained and demonstrated through internal communications, team–building activities, and in–country celebrations, among other things. Results from a mid–year well–being poll showed that most team members found NXP’s focus on well–being to be “just right” and requested more coverage on topics like health/wellness and general work/life balance. 
•
 Consistent communications and business updates: 
quarterly town hall meetings, small 
group sessions between NXP team members and leaders, and regular well–being check–ins led by NXP managers to ensure team members were doing well.
•
 Expanded 
our hiring practices: to ensure that when we identified qualified internal or 
external talent for a role, based on their capabilities, even if they were not located in a country or market where we originally planned for the role. FOCUSING ON TEAM MEMBER RETENTION

FOCUSING ON TEAM MEMBER RETENTION
• Focused attention on our global manufacturing team  
members: which consists of a workforce that is required to 
operate high–end, expensive equipment, we ensure that these team members are well paid (above entry–level pay in the market in which they operate), incented to perform with periodic bonus programs, invited to special events to build community, and support with employee development programs (tool certifications and personal development). We also have strong onboarding programs to orient the new team members to NXP and train them for their jobs. So, while these roles might be entry–level within the NXP job hierarchy, the individuals who perform them are skilled, and run complex processes on tools every day.      We spend significant time to build and maintain good relationships with our direct labor (DL) team members. In some countries, there is presence of official employee representatives, like Works Councils (EMEA) and/or unions. Where applicable, NXP is continuously in conversation  
with these employee representatives to ensure that any issues raised are addressed and solved in collaboration  
with these groups.      Examples of the many initiatives/efforts ongoing to maintain our relationships with these team  
members include: 
 –Participating in the NXP W
inning Culture Survey every 
other year, which provides DL team members an opportunity to share their thoughts and provide feedback on their work environment, development opportunities, management, among other things. The leadership team then takes the top 1–3 issues for the DL population and implements action plans to address the issues. One example is the reinstatement of the Engineering Review Board (ERB) in the United States. An individual can apply to the ERB and have their experience reviewed, and ultimately qualify to be a candidate for an engineering position (higher job grade). This initiative was very  
positively received.   –NXP has opportunities to participate in our annual  
incentive program as our focus throughout the organization allows equitable AIP participation and payout opportunities across job levels and employee types, including our DL population.
 –Pr
oactive requests for information and feedback through 
suggestion boxes, regular roundtable discussions, allows us to hear directly from team members about what’s working well and/or opportunities for improvement, outside of the bi–annual Winning Culture Survey. 
 –Incr
eased the size of our DL workforce across all of our 
factories to reduce overtime, and provide sufficient resources to keep production at appropriate levels.
 –In our Asia factories, we pr
ovided direct access to  
COVID–19 vaccinations in 2021, and are now working towards providing them boosters. The focus on Asia was due to limited availability of the vaccination in those countries.  By NXP providing our team members (and many of their family members) access to the vaccines, we were able to keep them healthy and safe. 
 –As we continue to focus on r
etention, we will examine  
the many aspects required to offer a positive and inclusive environment to our team members. NXP has  
not experienced any material strikes or labor disputes, and we consider our team member relations to be  
strong and stable.

LABOR AND HUMAN RIGHTS COMMITMENTS
NXP collaborates closely with our business partners to proactively and transparently identify and address potential human–rights allegations and prevent or address credible  human–rights abuses. The scope of this commitment includes, but is not limited to, the transportation, harboring, recruitment, transfer, or receipt of persons by means of threat, force, coercion, abduction, fraud, or payments to any person having control over another person for exploitation.

In our operations and our supply chain, we use indirect 
labor, direct labor, temporary workers, and agency workers (including foreign migrant workers). We engage with all relevant functions and businesses across NXP and our supply chain, to identify practices that may lead to non–compliance with our policies and standards.
The Social Responsibility and Procurement teams identify 
salient human–rights risks using our own risk analysis, our collaboration with key stakeholders — including industry associations, expert groups, and NGOs — and the results from our supplier assessments and audits.

SALIENT HUMAN–RIGHTS ISSUES: 2021 RESULTS
Our Operations Our Supply Chain
No Fees Workers did not pay fees 33% of suppliers audited charged hiring fees. All but one supplier refunded 
these fees. Dialogue to close the one nonconformances is ongoing
Retention of Documents Personal documents are retained by workers Of six suppliers, one has yet to return personal documents to workers
Fair Treatment of Vulnerable  
Workers During a PandemicNXP hired 16 migrant workers from Nepal at our site in Malaysia. These 
workers were recruited from an employer whose factory was closed due to the pandemic. The workers paid recruitment–related fees to the original employer. After attempts to contact the former employer to repay the fees failed, NXP reimbursed the workers directlyThe resumption of more supplier audits enabled NXP to interview workers to understand their well–being during the pandemic. While no serious issues were reported, workers have been provided with the NXP anonymous phone line to report any concerns or impacts to their rights
Working Hours and Rest Days At one site, the 60–hour working limit was exceeded for approximately 180 workers, or 6% of the site's direct–labor workforce for a period of 14 weeks. This was due to the labor shortage, challenges in hiring foreign–migrant workers, and border closures83% of suppliers audited did not monitor working hours and rest days.  One supplier has not closed this nonconformance
Young Workers No child labor. All young workers are in accordance with relevant laws  and regulationsNo child labor. All young workers are in accordance with relevant laws  and regulations
Accurate Contracts Accurate contracts in native language issued to all workers 50% of suppliers audited had inaccurate contracts. All suppliers have closed this nonconformance
Fair Wages No discrepancies in wages or benefits 83% of suppliers audited had discrepancies in wages and benefits.  All suppliers have closed this nonconformance
HUMAN RIGHTS ACHIEVEMENTS 
NXP’s Social Responsibility program was again recognized in 2021 for its work in addressing 
modern–day slavery issues within NXP operations and our supply chain. 
For the fourth consecutive year, the Annual UN Forum on Business and Human Rights invited 
NXP to be a featured panelist in a session about lessons learned from the pandemic. We described our work in the supply chain and our efforts to help foreign migrant workers, who are some of the most vulnerable to human–rights abuses during a crisis like the COVID–19 pandemic. We also shared out thoughts on how businesses can collaborate with governments and civil–society organizations to address human rights.The secretariat of the Bali Process, an official international forum concerned with issues relating to human smuggling, trafficking, and related transnational crimes, invited NXP to a special session, attended by representatives of Bali Process member states, where we discussed in  more detail the insights we shared at the State of Play of Forced Labor in the Electronics  Sector conference.HUMAN RIGHTS

GOVERNANCE
The governance of Health & Safety lies within the Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) 
Management Board, which consists of executives and senior leaders who define the development, approval, purpose, value, strategies, policies, goals, and metrics for  improvement plans.
Corporate EHS and the EHS Standards Committee establish risk–mitigation strategies and  
also develop and deploy standards, programs, and procedures to reduce risks to health  and safety worldwide.
In addition, each manufacturing site’s EHS Team collaborates closely with the manufacturing 
teams to review safety metrics and scrutinize every incident and conduct a root–cause analysis. The corrective actions taken are communicated to our global sites for continuous improvement.
Each Safety Committee/Worker Council includes designated team members who are 
encouraged to consult and participate in the Management System process. These committees perform periodic walkthroughs to evaluate safety and potential areas of risk to continuously improve and demonstrate our commitment to safety. The committees meet regularly to assist with hazard identification and risk assessments, investigate incidents, implement EHS policies, identify opportunities for continuous improvement of the EHS Management Systems, and take an active role in safety awareness and training.CERTIFICATION
We ensure the health and safety of our team members by using advanced management systems and certifications that enable adoption and consistent implementation at a global scale. All manufacturing sites, as well as  corporate headquarters, are certified to the ISO 45001 standard for Occupational Health and Safety, and are audited both externally and internally for third–party certification. 
Our non–manufacturing sites follow our internal procedures related to Health & Safety and are also periodically audited. These audits help us control our risks and improve performance while protecting the well–being of our team members. 
The benefits of ISO 45001 include a greater emphasis on worker participation and consultation, 
ensuring workers are able to participate in all parts of the Management System process, including risk and hazard identification, incident investigation, and awareness programs.  As a result, all team members are empowered to help create a safer work environment.HEALTH & SAFETY

EVALUATION
RISK ASSESSMENTS
We conduct annual risk assessments to evaluate the in–place 
management system and identify any potential risks or safety hazards. Each year we consider the likelihood of a given occurrence and proactively mitigate risks and hazards through programs, procedures, and engineering controls. 
SELF–ASSESSMENTS
During annual EHS self–assessments, each site completes a checklist that evaluates the Management System elements of the ISO 45001 standard. To address issues, each site creates a corrective action plan and closes out the nonconformances accordingly. As part of our membership in the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), each manufacturing site also completes an annual RBA Self–Assessment questionnaire that, among others, addressees health and safety as well as management systems.
AUDITS
The EHS and Social Responsibility teams use external audit firms to conduct internal audits. These selected firms are experts in the standards for EHS Management Systems and NXP Social Responsibility Standards. As part of these audits, NXP’s manufacturing sites are required to demonstrate compliance with the Health and Safety section of the NXP Auditable Standards on Social Responsibility . 
Due to COVID–19 restrictions in 2021, EHS and Social Responsibility audits were either conducted remotely or postponed, depending on the local effects of the pandemic. Internal audits are typically conducted every 30 months and audit nonconformances are categorized according to severity. 
Our registrar, Lloyd’s Registrar Quality Assurance (LRQA), 
conducts third–party audits each year to evaluate corporate EHS and, on average, two sites per year. LRQA determines which sites are audited each year. In 2021, a sampling of compliance and management systems were audited via remote auditing. A formal report was issued, and corrective actions are being tracked until LRQA indicates that they have been satisfactorily closed.TRAINING 
Company–wide, NXP trains our team members to ensure they are equipped with the skills and knowledge to perform their functions safely. This includes job–specific and site–specific training, on–the–job training, and specialized training that includes chemical handling, chemical management and  safety, emergency response, ergonomics, and other  safety–related topics. 
VALIDATION
The Sustainability Office validates the information entered in the Health & Safety database. Validation consists of the following steps:
•
 Check for completeness of data (sites and parameters)
•
 Compar
e data from the reporting period with data from 
previous periods
•
 Deter
mine whether changes in data are significant
•
 Seek explanations for significant data changes
•
 Compar
e related data (e.g. number of illnesses and injuries 
versus lost workdays)
•
 Investigate notable events
The EHS teams at each manufacturing site meet weekly with 
the senior management to r
eview performance, the progress  
of improvement projects, and expectations for each  project milestone.
To ensure reliable and accurate reporting, we conduct internal 
audits of our manufacturing sites, large offices, and R&D sites, checking for proper reporting procedures and data trails.HEALTH & SAFETY

RESULTS
In 2021 there were no incidents that resulted in fines or sanctions in connection with 
noncompliance of health and safety laws or regulations. There were no fatal work–related accidents for our workers or contractors. 
INJURY RATE
We maintained our historic low injury rate (TCIR) of 0.08 in 2021, and remains well below the semiconductor–industry averages published by the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA)  and the European Semiconductor Industry Association (ESIA), which ranges from 0.35 to 0.89. NXP’s low injury rate is attributed to the robust Health & Safety programs we have in place at  all our manufacturing sites.
The Total Case Incident Rate (TCIR), a measure used by the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA) in the United States, to monitor industry safety, is defined as the number of work–related recordable injuries per hundred full–time workers during a one–year period. Tracking TCIR allows our EHS teams to identify patterns across different manufacturing and  non–manufacturing sites.OCCUPATIONAL ILLNESSES AND INJURIES
Each year, the number of occupational illnesses and injuries and the number of hours worked varies. We have experienced a decrease in the number of occupational illness and injuries since 2015 that we attribute to our ongoing focus on preventative measures.HEALTH & SAFETY

SEVERITY RATE
The severity rate indicates the seriousness of injuries. It is a calculation that describes the number 
of lost days compared to the number of incidents experienced. The severity rate can increase due to a work–related injury of a single incident, since it may require more time off. In addition, as the absolute number of injuries decreases, the types of injuries and the severity rate will vary. 
Our severity rate went down again in 2021, resulting in a continuous decrease. Our successful 
efforts to share and communicate issues and root causes across all sites are reflected in our ability to remain below the industry average for severity rate, which ranges from 6 to 8. We continue to emphasize the importance of providing a safe workplace by not only measuring our injury rate but also identifying trends, conducting year–on–year analyses, and categorizing injury types to help identify corrective action.

CERTIFICATION
In accordance with criteria from the 
International Organization of Standardization (ISO), our environmental management system is certified to ISO 14001 at all our manufacturing sites.
GOVERNANCE
Our Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) Management Board is responsible for environmental management, including strategy, approval, and resourcing, chaired by the EVP of Operations, and supported by senior leaders in business lines and  staff functions.  
NXP’s Sustainability and EHS teams manage annual strategies, 
policies, goals, and metrics, and reviews progress monthly. Corporate EHS and the EHS Standards Committee establish risk–mitigation strategies and also develop and deploy standards, programs, and procedures to reduce  environmental risks.
Our EHS team performs monthly formal reviews with all 
manufacturing sites to examine data, discuss the progress of improvement projects, and set expectations for the  next period.
RISK ASSESSMENTS, SELF–ASSESSMENTS,  
AND AUDITS
RISK ASSESSMENTS
All NXP manufacturing sites conduct internal environmental risk 
assessments annually. To meet the requirements of ISO 14001, we evaluate potential risks associated with our manufacturing processes, including materials handling as well as energy, water and waste management, to proactively identify, mitigate, and manage potential environmental hazards using programs, procedures, and engineering controls.SELF–ASSESSMENTS
As part of our membership in the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), each of our eight manufacturing sites are required to complete an annual RBA Self–Assessment that covers environmental systems and management systems. Conducting self–assessments helps us evaluate potentially significant social and environmental risks at our manufacturing sites and apply appropriate mitigation and controls as needed.
AUDITS
The EHS and Social Responsibility teams use external audit firms to conduct internal audits. As part of these audits, NXP’s manufacturing sites are required to demonstrate compliance with the Environment section of the NXP Auditable Standards on Social Responsibility . 
Due to COVID–19 restrictions in 2021, EHS and Social Responsibility audits were conducted remotely or postponed depending on the local effects of the pandemic. Internal audits are typically conducted every 30 months and audit nonconformances are categorized according to severity. 
Our registrar, Lloyd’s Registrar Quality Assurance (LRQA), also 
conducts third–party audits each year to evaluate corporate EHS, and an average of two manufacturing sites per year. LRQA selects which manufacturing sites are audited each year. Corrective actions are tracked until LRQA indicates that our corrective actions are satisfactorily closed. In 2021, a sampling of compliance and management systems were audited remotely. A formal report was issued, identifying a few  minor nonconformances around document updates  and business continuity. 
Larger offices and R&D sites conduct annual self–assessments 
and are audited by a third party approximately every five years.
NXP received four Notices of Violation (NOVs) in 2021, 
primarily related to minor  administrative deficiencies. These violations were quickly corrected, and preventive methods were put in place to minimize any chance of reoccurrence. TRAINING
We offer company–wide training to ensure our global workforce is equipped with the skills and knowledge to perform their functions safely and with zero harm to the environment. This includes job–specific and site–specific training, on–the–job training, and specialized training that includes the prevention of stormwater pollution, management of hazardous waste and wastewater, handling of chemicals, shipping of hazardous materials, and other topics related to the environment. Training and awareness includes  engaging our team members in incident investigations, to identify potential improvements, and to assist in the implementation and ongoing improvement of management systems.
VALIDATION
NXP’s data–management system tracks and calculates our environmental performance per manufacturing site. On a monthly basis, the Sustainability Office validates the reported data for every site that a) we own, rent, lease, or manage, b) has 50 or more team members, and c) is included in our financial reporting.
Validation consists of the following steps:
•
 Check for completeness of data (sites and parameters)
•
 Compar

Overview 
ManagementEmissionsEnergyWaterWaste  PackagingHazardous Materials
As semiconductor technology evolves, manufacturing 
processes are becoming more complex. Smaller, faster semiconductors require more process steps to produce, which means production consumes more energy and requires more processing chemicals. That, in turn, translates to an increase in Scope 1 & 2 absolute emissions. We work to offset this by continually optimizing our processes and increasing our abatement of process emissions.
Our manufacturing sites generate Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 
2 (indirect) Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. The three main contributors to our carbon footprint are emissions from purchased electricity and from the use of PerFluoroCarbons (PFCs) and Heat–Transfer Fluids (HTFs). 
 
Electricity, PFCs, and HTFs are essential to semiconductor manufacturing. We have set reduction goals for both Scope 1 & 2, since it’s not currently feasible to eliminate these sources of emissions from our production processes.EMISSIONS

GOALS
Our goal to be carbon neutral by 2035 presents multiple layers of complexity when considering 
our use of electricity derived from fossil fuels, PFCs, and HTFs. The picture becomes even more complex when we consider annual increases in semiconductor production which, in turn, increase our three main GHG contributors. To keep ourselves accountable, we have committed to Science Based Targets initiative
10 (SBTi) in 2022 and have identified the following  
mid–term goals.
By 2027, our mid–term goal is to reduce Scope 1 & 2 emissions by 35% from a 2021 baseline. 
To reach our mid–term goal, we will address Scope 1 reduction by focusing on designing and/or installing equipment to reduce emissions, substituting chemicals, and optimizing manufacturing processes. Since electricity is our largest GHG contributor, our mid–term  goal is to increase our renewable energy use to 50% and thereby decrease our Scope 2 emissions. To help achieve our 2027 goal, we created a task force to identify opportunities  for additional emissions reduction. EMISSIONS

CARBON FOOTPRINT
In 2021, the demand for our products increased 22% compared to 2020. That meant our 
electricity, PFC11, and HTF consumption increased as well. As a result, our absolute Scope 1 & 
2 emissions increased 8% compared to 2020. However, our normalized Scope 1 & 2 emissions decreased by 11% from 2020. While a 22% production increase is significant, it was our efforts in 2021 to conserve electricity, optimize our processes, upgrade tools, and install abatement equipment, that resulted in only an 8% increase for absolute Scope 1 & 2 emissions. 
A decade of collective effort has significantly reduced our Scope 1 & 2 emissions. Since 2011,

SCOPE 1 EMISSIONS
The GHG Protocol defines Scope 1 emissions as direct emissions from company–owned and 
controlled resources, including process emissions (from onsite manufacturing) and stationary combustion (fuels, heating sources, etc.).
Our Scope 1 emissions include PFCs, HTFs, emissions from the consumption of fossil fuels,  
and emissions of so–called Kyoto gases, including Nitrous Oxide (N
2O) and  
Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF6).
In 2021, the demand for our products increased by 22% compared to 2020. As a result,  we used larger amounts of processing chemicals that are classified as Scope 1 emissions.  While our absolute Scope 1 emissions increased by 18%, our normalized Scope 1 emissions decreased by 3% from 2020.  
Since 2011, our efforts to optimize our processes, upgrade tools, and install abatement 
equipment have lowered our absolute Scope 1 emissions by 34% and our normalized  Scope 1 emissions by 43%.EMISSIONS

PFCs are critical to semiconductor manufacturing. At present, there are no viable alternatives 
for the PFCs used in the manufacturing process to etch integrated circuitry onto silicon wafers and to clean the internal chambers of deposition equipment. We use a variety of controls to minimize the impact of PFCs on the environment. 
NXP is a signatory to the Memorandum of Understanding in the United States, and the 
Memorandum of Agreement in Europe, which both seek voluntary reductions in PFC emissions. We also support the Global Semiconductor Industry PFC voluntary agreement supported by all members of the World Semiconductor Council (WSC).

Our PFC usage today is significantly higher than it was ten years ago, because we produce 
increasingly complex products that involve more processing steps compared to 2011, and  the added processing steps mean we use more PFCs, too. The demand for our products in 2021 increased by 22% versus 2020 and, as a result, our PFC usage increased, resulting in  an increase of our absolute PFC emissions by 23%, and our normalized PFC emissions by  1% compared to 2020.
Our ongoing efforts to optimize our processes, upgrade tools, and install abatement 
equipment, resulted in a continuous decrease of PFC emissions, regardless of the increased PFC usage in our more complex manufacturing processes. Since 2011, our absolute PFC emissions have decreased by 54% and our normalized PFC emissions have decreased by 61%.  EMISSIONS

Since the majority of HTFs are used in the manufacturing and testing processes of our RF 
products, when demand for RF products rose by 96% compared to 2020, our use of HTF  also increased. With the increased consumption of HTF, our absolute HTF emissions rose  by 15% in 2021, but our normalized HTF emissions decreased by 5% from 2020, despite  the increase in production. 
To address HTF emissions, our talented team members have designed and implemented new 
tools to collect emissions from vapor–diffusive loss and fluid drag–out, by designing a semi–automated, closed–loop system. Since 2013, absolute HTF emissions have gone down by 14% and normalized emissions by 17%.

BUSINESS TRAVEL
In 2019, our team members were already traveling less than in previous years, but the 
COVID–19 pandemic essentially stopped all travel for 2020 and 2021. For comparison, in 2019, our business travel emissions totaled 13,008 tons of CO
2e, which at the time was our lowest 
recorded over eight years. In 2021, however, our business travel totaled just 555 tons of CO2e, 
approximately a 96% decrease from 2019. PRODUCT TRANSPORTATION
Emissions from product transportation include transporting semi–finished products between manufacturing sites, and transporting fully finished products to warehouses and customers. In 2021, our CO
2 emissions from product transportation were estimated at 11,561 tons CO2e 
(based on kilograms per kilometer), but with a 22% production increase in 2021, we expect an increase when the data becomes available in mid–2022. 2021 emissions data for transportation will be updated in the 2022 Corporate Sustainability Report.EMISSIONS

NON–GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS NOX, SOX, AND VOCS
Our Non–Greenhouse Gas Emissions, which include nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx) 
and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), mostly come from our manufacturing processes, including the use of chemical solvents in the photolithography process, but also from our boilers and emergency generators. 
Since 2011, we had seen a significant reduction in non–greenhouse gas emissions, but in 2021, 
several events significantly increased these emissions. 
During the unprecedented winter storm in Austin, Texas, we lost all, or most of the electricity 
supplied to our two manufacturing sites for six days. This forced us to depend on diesel fuel to power our emergency generators and run critical safety systems. As a result, our global consumption of diesel fuel went up by 171% for the year, and we increased our emission of NOx, SOx and VOC combustion by–products. The normal total NOx, SOx and VOC emissions from our two Austin factories had been ~46,000 kilograms in 2020, compared to ~77,000 kilograms in 2021 – a 66% increase of all three combined.
In 2021, our production increased by 22% compared to 2020, and we expanded our Systems 
on Silicon Manufacturing Company (SSMC) wafer fab in Singapore. Expanding the SSMC facility had the largest impact on our increased VOCs as those production areas ramped up. EMISSIONS

ELECTRICITY ENERGY SOURCES
Electricity is generated from a variety of energy resources in the grid, and these resources vary 
depending on location and country. Currently, we use a mix of energy sources because of its availability, stability, and reliability. However, our goal is to transition to 100% renewable energy. RENEWABLE ENERGY
Since 2015, we have steadily increased our use of electricity that comes from renewable sources. In 2021, 31% of our overall electricity use was from renewable energy sources, and our Nijmegen wafer fab, in the Netherlands, runs on 100% renewable energy. We continue to look for new ways to increase our use of renewable energy sources through power purchase agreements.
Our total electricity consumption increased by 5% compared to 2020. However,  renewable 
energy as a portion of the electricity from the grid decreased by 1 percentage point. Our manufacturing sites located in the Asia–Pacific region contain a lower percentage of renewable energy and, at the same time, the electricity consumption at these sites also increased by 12% compared to 2020. The Asia–Pacific combination of higher electricity consumption and lower percentage of renewable energy reduced our total percentage of renewable energy. 
Over the last year, some utility company’s reports have been revised and is now publishing a 
higher percentage of renewable energy than what was previously published. We have since updated our percent of renewable energy in this year’s report to reflect these changes, and thus percentages reported in this 2021 report are higher than what was reported in the 2020 report. We anticipate needing to update the previous year’s renewable energy percentage again in future, since utility companies tend to issue their reports several months after we publish our annual Corporate Sustainability Report.

In case of power interruptions, we have diesel–driven emergency generators that support essential safety systems. Our consumption of diesel fuel fluctuates depending on how often we test or need to use these emergency safety systems. In 2021, our total use of diesel increased significantly because of the unprecedented winter storm in Austin, Texas. The two manufacturing sites in Austin lost their supplies of power and natural gas for extended periods of time. As a result, boilers had to switch from natural gas to diesel, and safety and emergency support functions had to run on backup power provided by emergency generators using diesel.ENERGY

Semiconductor manufacturing, especially wafer fabrication, is a water–intensive 
process. It also creates wastewater that is discharged from our manufacturing sites. Our global water strategy includes a focus on conservation, recycling, and high  standards for wastewater treatment and discharge. 
We understand that, in addition to impacting our manufacturing sites, water availability also 
impacts other industrial, agricultural, and residential users in the communities where we operate. By using less water, we can help increase the supply for others in our communities.
Since drastically reducing the amount of water used within our manufacturing processes is 
not currently feasible, we anticipate that our demand for water will increase in line with our increases in production. To reduce the amount of incoming water we consume, we focus on a mid–term goal of increasing our water recycling rate to 60% by 2027.
Many of our manufacturing and testing sites are located in semi–arid regions that may become 
increasingly vulnerable to  prolonged droughts associated with evolving changes to the climate, which may lead to resource scarcity. Each manufacturing site is addressing the impacts of water scarcity based on their location, and are identifying best practices associated with water recycling and conservation in order to reach our mid–term goal.WATER

NXP GLOBAL WATER STRESS SCORES
The Water Stress Index (WSI) evaluation tool is used by the United Nations and other 
organizations to study the relationship between water use and water availability. The WSI is published by the data analysis company Verisk Maplecroft. It quantifies baseline water stress where water naturally collects, at the catchment level, while also identifying localized variations within the catchment boundaries. A risk category is assigned to each catchment based on the ratio of water use to renewable supply, so it’s easier to visualize the inherent water stress in the area. Within catchments, the map reflects different levels of combined demand for domestic, industrial, and agricultural water.WATER

WSI scores are divided into four risk categories: extreme (0.0–2.5), high (>2.5–5.0), medium (>5.0–7.5), and low (>7.5–10.0). The index is based on mean annual water stress, and therefore the seasonality of water stress is not captured. Countries are assigned a rank according to their relative position in each index. 
According to the WSI evaluation tool, many of our manufacturing and testing sites are located 
in semi–arid regions with some identified as extreme and high risk. These manufacturing sites may become increasingly vulnerable to water scarcity.

Semiconductor wafer fabrication represents 66% of our total water consumption.
At our manufacturing sites, water mostly comes from nearby municipal facilities. The Nijmegen facility is our only manufacturing site that extracts well water, representing 6% of our total 
water consumption.
In 2021, we are close to using the same amount of recycled water as non–recycled water. We have identified water recycling rate as a mid–term goal, in which we aspire to recycle 60% of our 
water by 2027, because increasing the amount of water we recycle will generate positive results for NXP and our communities.

WATER CONSUMPTION
The manufacturing processes used to produce semiconductors are becoming more complex. 
Smaller, faster semiconductors require more processing steps to produce, which in turn increases the amount of water used for cleaning, ensure product quality and process safety. In 2021, the demand for our products increased 22% compared to 2020. As a result of this demand, our absolute water consumption increased by 9% compared to 2020. However, our normalized water consumption decreased by 11% from 2020. Our decade–long focus on water conservation, which emphasized the use of more efficient tools, taking advantage of opportunities to increase water recycling, and finding ways to optimize processes, kept our absolute water–consumption level low and helped us achieve a 14% decrease in normalized water consumption compared to 2011.

We are committed to returning water to the environment that is as clean, or cleaner than 
what we sourced. We employ onsite water-treatment facilities to treat wastewater outflows, and ensure any chemical constituents from our wastewater that could potentially impact  the environment are avoided. Our facility teams continuously monitor and test our water,  as required by local authorities, and perform better than  local wastewater discharge  permit requires. 
In late 2020, we included wastewater discharge in our data-management system,  
and we plan to include detailed measurements for water discharge and evaporation  in our future reports.

Semiconductor manufacturing generates hazardous and non–hazardous waste  
streams, including lithography–related solvents, metal plating waste, specialty cleaners,  spent sulfuric acid, ammonium sulfate, and calcium fluoride. Our operations also generate paper, plastic, metal, and kitchen waste, along with general office waste. We also have one–time waste from construction and/or other one–time manufacturing activities.
We understand that reducing or eliminating waste streams not only contributes to greater 
operational efficiencies but also contributes to a more sustainable circular economy.WASTE

NXP continues to actively evolve our approach to the sourcing, consumption, and disposal  of materials critical to the manufacturing and testing of our products. We have set a mid–term goal of recycling 90% of our waste by keeping products and materials in use via reuse, resale, repurposing, and recycling.
Our long–term ambition is to collaborate with our supply chain to develop better, more 
sustainable products. We know we can add value by looking at our entire supply chain and asking, at each point in the chain, if any or all waste can be an input back into the system. 
We will continue to work with our supply chain to purchase goods and services locally, and find 
alternate uses for materials we have as by–products. We believe we play a crucial role in being a driver and an enabler to our supply chain in their adoption of circular–economy principles. Going forward, we plan to conduct additional product lifecycle analyses with the aim of identifying additional opportunities to reduce environmental impacts, unlock potential value, and enable the setting of future performance goals.
APPROACH
We are committed to reducing the amount of waste we send to landfill, and work to recycle/reuse the waste we generate. We continue to collaborate with our supply chain to identify opportunities for waste reduction or alternative use, and look for ways to reduce manufacturing waste by improving yield, optimizing processes, and minimizing the waste of scrap material.

RESULTSWASTE
Our total waste generation includes regular ongoing waste generated by our manufacturing 
sites (including manufacturing, office and canteen waste), as well as one–time waste. We consider one–time waste to be those waste streams that are not generated as part of normal operations, but rather by unique, one–time projects. One–time waste accounted for less than 1% of total waste generation in 2020 and 2021; therefore, it is not included in our normal waste metrics and analysis, unless otherwise indicated.
In 2021, our production increased by 22% from 2020 and, as a result, our total waste 
generation increased by 18%. Since 2011, our total waste generation has increased by 12%.
We have waste–reduction management programs in place at our sites to handle hazardous 
and non–hazardous waste in an environmentally responsible manner.

Our recycling rate includes waste–to–energy activities, which include the conversion of non–recyclable waste materials into usable heat, electricity, or fuel through incineration. If we exclude waste–to–energy, the 2021 recycle rate is 69%. 
We have lost some of the gains we made in the last ten 
years, because some vendors stopped accepting certain waste streams, or, others either don’t support a given type of waste or lack sufficient demand to accept it. We continue to search for alternative recycling vendors to increase our recycling opportunities. Several new recycling streams were implemented in 2021, which helped increase our recycling rate, as described in the NXP In Action section.

The semiconductor industry as a whole uses a wide variety of chemicals and materials in wafer 
fabs, assembly and test facilities, and in the final products sold. Some of these chemicals and materials are highly specific and vital to specific process technologies and/or products. At NXP , we have several programs in place to regulate our use of hazardous chemicals and materials, and we follow some of the most rigorous standards in the industry for protecting our team members, customers, and the environment.
We focus on select chemicals to minimize and/or phase–out based on regulatory or other 
potential risks. Specific near–term challenges for the semiconductor industry include addressing concerns related to per–and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), Phthalates, and die–bond epoxies. HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS AND MATERIALS

PhthalatesProtecting our team members’ health and safety, as well as the environment,  is of utmost importance. NXP takes a multi–tiered approach when working with  chemicals. That includes finding safer and/or alternative materials, providing engineering controls to separate team members from potential emissions, providing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), creating standard operating procedures that take into consideration operational risks, providing training and awareness to enhance personal safety, and routine monitoring of manufacturing work areas to ensure hygiene monitoring, which includes monitoring the ambient air and team members’ health to ensure all controls are functioning and effective.
Our mid–term goal for 2027 is to recycle 90% of all waste, including hazardous waste. Much of 
the waste NXP currently generates, while considered hazardous, is often clean enough for use as “virgin” raw materials in other industries. NXP works with vendors to redirect these waste streams, as applicable to other companies, while increasing our recycling percentage. 
NXP must always comply with all relevant legislation, and aims to stay ahead of new chemical 
legislation and customer requirements. Our chemical–management programs have two primary goals. First, we must control the risks posed by chemicals used in our production processes, in terms of  team members health and safety, as well as environmental effects, such as pollution, climate change, and ozone depletion. Second, we must ensure that any products and shipping materials we supply pose no or negligible risk, due to the presence of hazardous chemicals, to our customers or the environment.
OZONE–DEPLETING SUBSTANCES (ODS)
As of 2007, we phased out the use of all ODS in our manufacturing processes and these substances are now prohibited at our manufacturing sites. When an air–conditioning system that uses ODS refrigerants is scheduled for replacement, we replace it with a new system that doesn’t use ODS. The majority of air conditioners that use ODS refrigerants have either been replaced, or, are in the process of being replaced wherever possible and practical.

NXP is committed to the safe handling of all substances of concern. We continually search for 
alternative substances, and aim to discontinue using all substances of concern except those that don’t have a safe, proven manufacturing alternative.
GOVERNANCE
An internal Chemical Management committee meets regularly to review current and pending regulations, such as the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS), as well as the requirements of various governmental organizations, including the European Union and, in the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The goal is to not only remain compliant, but also, where possible, exceed legal and safety requirements. The Chemical Management committee consists of cross–functional team members from Sustainability, Environment, Health and Safety, and Environmental Product Compliance. Working collaboratively, the committee has succeeded in implementing global processes and procedures that serve to keep our team members safe, and minimize our environmental impact. The Chemical Management committee reports progress to the Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) Management Board.
PFOS/PFOA COMMITMENT
NXP complies with the World Semiconductor Council’s (WSC’s) Voluntary Agreement for PerFluoroOctyl Sulfonates (PFOS). In 2017, we eliminated all manufacturing uses of PFOS. In 2020, we made great progress in also eliminating all manufacturing use of PerFluoroOctanoic Acid (PFOA), with the exception of a small amount (less than 1 kg annually) that is being phased out of the Oak Hill manufacturing site over the next two years.PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES
NXP Corporate Chemical Control Standard – Provides direction regarding chemical controls, approval of chemicals, transport of chemicals, reporting, and other requirements to or by Corporate EHS. 
Approval Requirements for New Chemicals – Before any new chemicals are purchased or 
brought onsite, EHS approval is required across multiple systems. During the chemical review, the local industrial hygienist and safety expert conduct a dedicated risk assessment, where all EHS aspects, such as exposure to humans, environment and/or safety is reviewed. The EHS teams also review environmental regulations to ensure that new chemicals are not in violation of governmental requirements.
Prohibited and Restricted Chemicals Standard – Corporate EHS maintains a list of chemicals 
that are either prohibited in manufacturing, or restricted, meaning their use is limited to specific applications and accompanied by detailed risk–mitigation measures. This list is reviewed and approved by managers via an electronic waiver system. The list is based on current and future regulations (e.g. RoHS, REACH) and also reflects customer requests. Onsite teams review and evaluate local restrictions and regulations regarding such chemicals.
SDS Management – Safety Data Sheets are managed in a corporate system that allows for 
global NXP reporting. Site team members are able to view all site–applicable data sheets as needed for their job functions.
Environmental Product Centralized Database – We use databases to register and classify 
more than 500 substances used in roughly 2,500 process chemicals and preparations, along with more than 20,000 product–related materials used by our manufacturing processes. We update the database frequently to ensure they reflect the latest information. Our product–compliance system calculates and tracks substance amounts in our materials against the latest legislative and customer restrictions.SUBSTANCES OF CONCERN

Supplier Code of ConductSupply Chain Management

NXP is committed to ensuring that working conditions in our supply chain are safe, that 
workers are treated with respect and dignity, and that our products and processes are environmentally responsible. 
NXP has business relationships with more than 10,000 suppliers globally. Our suppliers range 
from external manufacturing partners, direct materials suppliers, labor agents, tool and machine manufacturers, logistics providers, packaging services, and onsite service providers for both NXP facilities and suppliers’ facilities. 
Observing applicable rules of law; respect for ethical business, environmental, and human- 
right practices; and continuous improvement, we take a collaborative approach to supplier  and contractor relationships, where we focus on continuous improvement in our supply  chain, by conducting annual risk assessments, and audit those suppliers identified through  our risk assessment.
LOOKING FORWARD
Our goal is to continue working closely with suppliers who have had audit nonconformance or priority violations, to ensure they fully understand our standards and are equipped with the skills and knowledge to avoid recurrence. The results of these efforts help determine the effectiveness of our standards within the supply chain. Work in 2022 will also focus on a launching a vendor collaboration portal to increase two-way communication between NXP and our supply chain such as changes to NXP’s Supplier Code of Conduct and other policies.SUPPLIER ENGAGEMENT OVERVIEW

Supplier Code of ConductSupply Chain ManagementIn 2021, we engaged in capacity building and other activities that strengthened our supply-chain partnerships, and provided opportunities for our customers to participate. One such capacity building activity was a collaboration with a customer on a webinar focused on Managing Labor and Human Rights Risks in the Supply Chain. A total of 35 participated, representing nine supply chain partners in the interactive webinar session. NXP in Action
We hold our suppliers accountable for responsible conduct and 
performance by requiring them to comply with applicable laws and regulations and the NXP Supplier Code of Conduct.
The NXP Supplier Code of Conduct is owned by the Sustainability 
Office, approved by the ESG Management Board, and is based on the NXP Code of Conduct, the Responsible Business Alliance’s (RBA) Code of Conduct version 7.0, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), UN Guiding Principles, International Labour Organization (ILO) standards, Social Accountability International (SAI), the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI). The NXP Supplier Code of Conduct also includes elements, modifications, and clarifications from audits conducted internally and externally, as well as the NXP Auditable Standards on Social Responsibility .
The Supplier Code of Conduct is reviewed annually, and updated in 2021, in response to regulatory updates, customer requirements or expectations, industry best practices, and inputs from internal and supplier audits. 
Suppliers must adopt or establish a management system that is related 
to the content of the NXP Supplier Code of Conduct. The suppliers’ management system must be designed to ensure (a) compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and customer requirements related to the supplier’s operations and products; (b) conform to the NXP Supplier Code of Conduct; (c) identify and mitigate operational risks related to the NXP Supplier Code of Conduct; and (d) communicate the requirements to their own suppliers.NXP SUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT

SUPPLY CHAIN DUE DILIGENCE
Our suppliers submit a signed conformance letter stating that they abide by the NXP Supplier 
Code of Conduct, and are promptly notified with updates to our requirements.
Suppliers undergo an annual supplier risk assessment, in which 225 suppliers scored greater 
than 49% in their risk assessment score in 2021. These suppliers may be required to complete an NXP Self-Assessment Questionnaire and/or participate in an audit. 
NXP works with suppliers to help them achieve and maintain our standards and expectations. 
Our preference is to work with suppliers to address potential deficiencies, develop, and implement a corrective action plan. 
In 2021, our due-diligence supplier audits identified 160 nonconformances, in which we closed 
143, resulting in an 89% closure rate. We did not terminate business with any suppliers due to their cooperation and collaboration in taking the necessary steps towards closing their corrective and preventative action plans. We engaged actively with our suppliers to understand how the pandemic impacted their businesses, and the well-being of their employees. Using data obtained from the supply-chain pulse survey in 2020, NXP continued to engage through our due-diligence audit program, with those suppliers whose survey answers suggested business impact from the pandemic. SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
Scrutiny of goods produced using forced labor continued, as the United States and other jurisdictions banned their importation. The concerns for the semiconductor industry extended to potential risk of forced labor relating to poly-silicon and silica-based materials, a critical ingredient in the production of semiconductor wafers. In light of this new concern, NXP extended the due-diligence survey to include our poly-silicon and silica-based materials supply chain. The initial results showed no risk of forced labor. NXP will continue to evaluate and evolve our due-diligence practices to ensure that our supply chain remains free from forced labor.NXP in ActionASSESSMENTS AND AUDITS
RISK ASSESSMENT
Our supplier risk assessment, developed jointly with our procurement and sustainability teams, 
are reviewed, and updated to reflect the evolving environment, labor, and human rights landscape. Our supplier risk assessment considers three risk criteria: country, product, and spend. Each criterion has a scale of 1 (lowest risk) to 10 (highest risk). The overall supplier risk score is the product of the three individual scores, expressed as a percentage, which higher percentages implies a higher risk exposure.
Risk Score = [(Country Risk) x (Product or Service) x (Spend)] x 100

COUNTRY RISK
The geographical location of a supplier is a key factor in determining risk level, as suppliers 
in countries with weak regulations, inadequate enforcement of labor rights, and/or ineffective business ethics and environmental laws tend to have high risk exposure. Our Country Risk scores include specific indices from Maplecroft, a third-party partner, which correlates to the NXP Supplier Code of Conduct, and provides an overall weighted Country Risk score.  SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
Use of migrant workers is also a critical element when it comes to labor risk. To account for this, the calculated Country Risk score may be increased by one level after a review by the Sustainability team.

SPEND RISK
To assess business criticality risk, we group suppliers into three categories based on annual 
spend (USD): high risk (above $500,000), medium risk ($100,000 to $500,000), and low risk (under $100,000). 
As part of our annual risk-assessment analysis, we endeavor to assess all 10,000 of our suppliers. 
Yearly risk assessments enable NXP to identify and monitor trends and developments, relating to human rights, forced/bonded labor, the migrant worker index, fair wages, humane treatment, child labor, and/or health and safety, and highlight topics that may require a new or  different approach. 
Given the scale of this annual effort, NXP deploys two advisory firms, Verisk Maplecroft and 
Verité Cumulus, to identify potential issues relevant to our supply chains. Verisk Maplecroft’s database provides input that we use to screen our supply chain for inherent risk, and uses predictive models to evaluate areas such as forced labor, child labor, and working conditions. Verité Cumulus provides NXP with online technology to identify forced-labor and human-trafficking risks with our labor agents. Verité Cumulus also maps and assesses our labor  agents, in both the receiving and sending countries, and their recruitment practices.

NXP’s Social Responsibility Audit program is a collaborative and consultative process aimed at guiding suppliers and ensuring they meet the NXP Supplier Code of Conduct as well as the requirements of the NXP Auditable Standards on Social Responsibility. The scope of the audit covers labor and human rights, environment, health and safety, business ethics, management systems, and compliance with the NXP Supplier Code of Conduct. These audits are conducted so suppliers can improve their processes and procedures in these areas. The audits are not intended to pass or fail a supplier, but rather to guide the supplier in a collaborative approach. The NXP Supplier Code of Conduct and the Auditable Standards apply to all NXP suppliers, contractors, onsite service providers, labor agents, and external manufacturers. 
NXP supplier audits analyze three main aspects of social responsibility: documentation reviews, 
management and private worker interviews, and physical inspection of all facilities, including any dormitories (onsite audit only). Audits also include interviews with labor agents and onsite service providers, such as janitorial, canteen, security, and other services. The NXP Social Responsibility Audit program is conducted in accordance with a defined process flow:

SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
RISK ASSESSMENT 
The process starts with an annual NXP Supplier Risk Assessment to evaluate which suppliers 
have a high priority to be audited by NXP . 
TRAINING 
Once a supplier is selected for an audit, NXP consults with selected suppliers to determine if additional training is needed. 
SELF-ASSESSMENT 
The supplier then completes the NXP Supplier Self-Assessment and sends it back to NXP , including any applicable policies and documentation. 
ONSITE/REMOTE AUDIT 
The audit is led by a team of auditors from a third-party audit firm qualified by NXP and accompanied by an RBA-trained NXP auditor. Depending on the size and complexity of  the supplier’s operations, a typical audit requires two or three full days (onsite audit), and  ~18 days (remote audit). 
CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN 
If the audit yields a nonconformance, the supplier must submit a corrective action plan within two weeks of issuance of the final audit report. An effective corrective action plan includes remediation plans that fix the nonconformance, and create a management system to prevent  the issue from reoccurring.  Audits use classifications for corrective action plans: priority violation, major and minor nonconformance. 
•
 Priority violation – The supplier is given the opportunity to impr
ove performance, but the 
response and resolution of the violation is non-negotiable. If there is immediate risk of life, 
the supplier has 24 hours to complete the corrective action. Otherwise, the supplier has seven days to submit a corrective action plan and 30 days to complete the plan. Unresolved priority violations may result in the withdrawal or termination of business.
•
 Major and/or minor nonconfor
mances – All corrective actions must be approved by NXP 
and, unless otherwise negotiated or approved, must be fully closed within 90 days. Within that 90-day period, the supplier must update NXP every 30 days. 
FOLLOW-UP 
NXP may conduct verification audits to assess whether a supplier has fully addressed all 
corrective and preventive actions. These audits are scheduled after corrective actions are submitted by the supplier and approved by NXP . ANNUAL REVIEW 
Upon completion of the annual audit cycle, NXP conducts a review to determine if any suppliers that were audited in the preceding year will be required to be re-audited, based on the severity of the previous audit results. 
This video has more about our Social Responsibility Audit.
REMOTE AUDITS
Before COVID-19, we typically conducted up to an average of 20 onsite audits per year. We  
are pleased that in 2021 we managed to conduct eight audits using a combination of onsite, RBA VAP and/or remote audit formats. We worked with our third-party auditing firm, Verité,  to develop a new protocol for remote audits, so we could continue our due-diligence  work with suppliers.
Under normal circumstances, a typical onsite audit takes only two or three days to complete. 
Remote audits, however, are significantly more complex, and usually spread over an 18-day period that includes pre-assessment meetings, technical rehearsals, and the audit proper. Most of that time is spent on pre-audit preparations and desktop document reviews.

Overview
Supplier Code of ConductSupply Chain Management
SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
During the pre-assessment period, the audit team and the 
supplier hold videoconference calls to validate collected information, agree on a timeline, discuss confidentiality, and address data-privacy concerns. Technical rehearsals serve to confirm that the supplier has access to the videoconferencing platform selected for the audit, and that interview sessions, held with randomly selected workers, will take place in a location with adequate privacy. During the audit proper, the audit team conducts the actual interviews with supplier management and workers, and reviews documents and data, such as employee personnel files and pay slips, that can’t be shared in advance.
LIMITATIONS OF REMOTE AUDITS
Remote audits have given us a way to perform due diligence during the COVID-19 pandemic, but they are only a temporary solution, not suited for long-term replacement of onsite audits for several reasons. To begin with, remote audits are limited in scope, focusing primarily on labor, human rights, and ethics. They leave out the assessment of environment, and health and safety, since extensive facility inspections aren’t feasible with a remote process. Also, certain documents cannot be shared in advance, and screen sharing makes it difficult to review data and records effectively. What’s more, it’s easier, during an in-person interview, to keep people engaged, ask follow-up questions, and observe body language and facial expressions. 
We do see remote audits as a useful tool for follow-up or 
verification audits with suppliers who performed well in  their initial audit, and as a good alternative for suppliers  who already have a mature and strong social-responsibility program in place.  ONSITE AUDITS
Onsite audits of our suppliers can be announced or unannounced, conducted by an approved third-party audit firm, and accompanied, at a minimum, by an NXP-certified RBA Lead Auditor. It is NXP’s principle to understand the issues that arise during an audit, verify that the audit is conducted per the NXP Auditable Standards, and provide consultation if the supplier has challenges. 
RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS ALLIANCE VALIDATED 
ASSESSMENT PROGRAM (VAP) AUDITS
As a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), NXP 
has at its disposal, tools and programs initiated by the RBA, including the Validated Assessment Program (VAP). The VAP is similar to NXP’s onsite audit protocol, but with the RBA Code of Conduct as the audit criteria. VAP audits evaluate social, ethical, health and safety, and environmental performance  of RBA members and their supply chain as measured  against their audit criteria. 
In 2021, we extended our audit program by incorporating two 
RBA VAP audits at two of our suppliers who have demonstrated maturity in their social-responsibility performance. Moving forward, NXP will look to employ RBA VAP audits at more of our mature suppliers. More details of the RBA VAP protocols can be found here. 
The goal of the VAP is to help streamline a process that has 
frequently resulted in audit fatigue for suppliers subjected to multiple, similar audits by industry members. A VAP audit may be initiated by any RBA member, and audit results are available to any other member company working with that supplier. Report sharing is predicated on a Trading Relationship in the RBA-Online system
12 between the member company 
and the audited supplier. It is the responsibility of the member company initiating the VAP audit to review, approve, and verify corrective actions from the audit. TRAINING
Training focuses on our suppliers and their onsite service providers. The mode of training can be a one-to-one consultation training, a two-hour classroom training, or a webinar session conducted by the NXP Social Responsibility team with support from site subject-matter experts. The training is the full requirement of the NXP Supplier Code of Conduct. Supplier training is done: 
•
 Befor
e a supplier’s upcoming NXP Social 
Responsibility Audit
•
 During the supplier’
s corrective action plan closure timeline
•
 When a supplier r
equests training 
Coaching the supplier on best practices and providing RBA’s 
e-learning academy are also a part of our supplier trainings. 
VALIDATION
Each year we report publicly on our supplier’s annual top audit nonconformances, and each month we report key performance indicators to the Sustainability Office on topics such as violations and nonconformances from our supplier audits, signed conformance  letters, closure rate for corrective action plans, and quarter-on-quarter risk indicators within our supply chain. NXP monitors improvement by measuring the number of priority violations, repeat audits, frequency of nonconformances, and the nonconformance closure rate. 
Reports are reviewed frequently throughout the year by the 
Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) Management Board, which is composed of NXP executive and non-executive leadership. The ESG Management Board discusses the progress that has been made, areas for improvement, and new targets. Quarterly reviews are conducted with the Ethics Committee, and monthly reviews are conducted with the Quality leadership team. Monthly and sometimes weekly meetings are held with procurement managers to discuss the results of a supplier audit, the corrective action plan, and the supplier’s progress toward closing out their nonconformances.

SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
WORKPLACE GRIEVANCE MECHANISMS 
Suppliers are required to have workplace grievance mechanisms in place that ensure the 
confidentiality, anonymity, and protection of whistleblowers who may report any complaints, issues, or concerns. The grievance mechanism must be available in the workers’ languages. Suppliers must train their workers on the grievance mechanism and communicate the process to them, so workers can raise concerns without fear of retaliation. Suppliers must state in a policy that they will not tolerate any retaliation by management or any other person or group, directly or indirectly, against anyone who, in good faith, makes an allegation of misconduct or wrongdoing, or who helps management or any other person or group investigate an allegation. The supplier’s grievance mechanism must also be made available to their own suppliers. 
We expect suppliers to investigate, respond and close out all complaints, issues and concerns 
reported through the grievance mechanism. During a supplier audit, the auditor tests the grievance mechanism thoroughly. During a private worker interview, questions regarding the ways to report a grievance are discussed. After the interview, the auditor provides the worker with the NXP third-party grievance card, which they can use at any time and for any reason to make an anonymous report in the local language. 
NXP acknowledges that we are putting the worker in a vulnerable situation with a private 
interview, where potential negative impacts could occur, such as retaliation or discrimination. NXP addresses this by providing the NXP grievance mechanism and an agreement with the supplier that retaliation or discrimination will not occur. Any cases of retaliation reported will initiate an investigation and, if substantiated, will prompt NXP to take appropriate measures, including possible termination of business with that supplier.  
RESOLVING ALLEGATIONS RAISED FROM OUR GRIEVANCE MECHANISMS 
We monitor and assess compliance and investigate every allegation. These investigations may involve the NXP Ethics Committee. If a problem is detected, we analyze the root cause and modify the relevant internal control system to prevent a possible recurrence. Acknowledgments are sent as soon as possible after receiving the complaint and investigation records are updated regularly. No allegations were received in 2021.RESULTS
HIGH-RISK SUPPLIERS  
We annually conduct a supplier risk assessment to determine our audit schedule for high-risk 
suppliers. Risk is calculated according to three scoring categories, country, product and spend risks, which assigns a risk factor as either > 50% (medium risk), 50% - 70% (high risk), or 71% - 100% (priority risk). In the 2021 risk assessment, 225 suppliers were assessed and identified 132 medium-risk suppliers, 77 high-risk suppliers, and 16 priority-risk suppliers.

SUPPLIER AUDIT OVERVIEW
We began our supplier audit program in 2013 and have since audited 156 suppliers.  
Verification audits began in 2014.
In 2021, we conducted three announced onsite audits and six remote audits for new suppliers, 
located in Malaysia, Mainland China, and Taiwan. Two of the three onsite audits, were conducted using the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Validated Audit Program (VAP), directly initiated by NXP . We conducted no verification audits in 2021. 
In addition to the eight audits directly initiated and managed by NXP , we also had access to and 
monitored nine supplier RBA VAP audits that were initiated by other RBA member companies that share the same supply base. 
During an audit, worker interviews are conducted in private and at random. To determine the 
number of worker interviews to be conducted, we take the square root of the worker population. In 2021, 285 random worker interviews were conducted, covering a 57% men and 43% women, with varying lengths of service and age range.0510152025

SUPPLIER AUDIT NONCONFORMANCE RESULTS
Audits conducted in 2021 addressed suppliers who have previously been audited to a social 
responsibility standard. We are seeing a maturity in social responsibility practices at suppliers we had previously audited and they have been able to improve on their previous performance. We will continue to work with our suppliers as they implement our standards into their business practices and management systems.  The number of audits naturally increases the overall total number of nonconformances. Our approach is to divide the number of nonconformances per number of audits, as well as the number of priority violations per number of audits. While the number of nonconformances increased compared to 2020, we saw a decrease in 2021 compared to 2020, for both ratios.

target the top five as illustrated below. Although 2021 included remote audits and did  not evaluate all five categories, Freely Chosen Employment is still the most frequently  reoccurring nonconformance.
The eight audits conducted in 2021 uncovered five priority violations.
In 2021, we found three priority violations on No Fees for foreign migrant workers, hired by 
subcontractors, at one of our suppliers in Malaysia. The workers paid recruitment fees, had their wages deducted to pay off the foreign worker levy, and had their passports withheld. The other priority violation was at a supplier in China, where the medical fees had to be paid by the  worker upon recruitment. SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
AUDIT CLOSURE RATE
In 2018, we set a goal to close 80% of our supplier nonconformances within the 90-day timeframe. In 2021, we set a new goal at an 85% closure rate. We chose this 5% increase after reviewing improvements in closure-rate performance from audits performed in 2019 and 2020. We continue to provide a 15% threshold since we understand that some corrective actions, such as monetary investments and pandemic-related labor shortages that impact working hours, typically require more than 90 days to close. 
In 2013, when we began auditing suppliers, our closure rate was around 40%. Through 
continuous collaboration with our suppliers, our closure rate has continued to increase  year over year. 
The closure rate for 2021 was 89%, compared to 97% in 2020. The 8% drop was primarily 
due to almost double the number of audits completed in 2021 compared to 2020. The lower closure rate is also attributed to the demand on the supply-chain during the ongoing pandemic and production ramp up to overcome the semiconductor shortage. These two trends created challenges in working hours and labor supply at our suppliers in 2021. 
While it is our goal to achieve the targeted closure rate, ultimately we aim for a 100% for all audit 
nonconformances within the calendar year. We continue to work with audited suppliers to fully close out the remaining open nonconformances in the subsequent year. In 2021, not only did we close 89% of 2021’s audit nonconformances, we also closed out the remaining 3% of 2020’s open nonconformances. At the end of 2021, we have one nonconformance that has remained open since 2019. We continue to address the nonconformity with the supplier.

PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP
MINIMIZING THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACT 
OF EACH PRODUCT WE DESIGN AND PRODUCE 
OUR APPROACH
As an innovative and responsible manufacturer, NXP aims 
to prevent use of hazardous substances in our products. In addition, we ensure responsible sourcing of minerals to prevent use of materials linked to human rights abuses.
NEW PRODUCT DESIGN
To address current and future requirements for compliance during the design phase, we established the Environmental Compliance Organization for Products (ECO-Products) as part of the management systems for introducing new product and technologies. Checklists of currently banned materials, as well as chemicals that may be problematic for particular markets, are considered early in the design phase. This translates  to products that are more resilient and more marketable  for our customers.
SUPPLIER REQUIREMENTS
We rely on our suppliers and their subcontractors to help us identify and verify potential substances present in the raw materials, parts, and products they supply to NXP , and to use appropriate methods, such as internal design controls, declarations, and analytical testing, to ensure accuracy and completeness, and attest that information is correct to the  best of their knowledge.
Suppliers must meet the requirements of the NXP ECO-
Products Substance Control for Products and Packaging specification. We require suppliers to provide material content declarations and annual analytical test reports that are performed by a third-party laboratory certified to the ISO/IEC 17025 standard. Also, all declarations and reports must be specific to the material’s homogeneous material level.
REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
Like other technology companies, NXP is subject to and complies with a host of product regulations across multiple global jurisdictions. We also go beyond what is required by local, regional, and global laws.NXP anticipates that sustained stakeholder interest in product responsibility issues may result in new or updated regulations and exemption lists. This, combined with the arrival of new chemical substances, means compliance remains a challenge. See below to learn more about NXP’s efforts.
SUBSTANCES OF CONCERN IN PRODUCTS (SCIP) 
SCIP established under the Waste Framework  Directive (WFD)In 2021, NXP became subject to a new European Union (EU) reporting requirement known as the “Substances of Concern in articles as such or In complex objects (Products)” or “SCIP” database reporting.The EU Directive 2008/98/EC on Waste,  commonly known as the Waste Framework  Directive (WFD), sets stringent requirements on  waste management, recycling, and recovery of products manufactured in, supplied to, or imported to the European Economic Area. A new amendment of the Waste Framework Directive (Directive 2018/851) requires companies to provide information on articles supplied to the EU market containing Substances of Very High Concern (SVHCs) above 0.1%. This sparked the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) to establish the SCIP database.
The EU aims to use the SCIP database in several ways.  
This includes: 
•
 Decr
easing the generation of waste-containing hazardous 
substances by supporting the substitution of substances of 
concern in articles placed on the EU market, 
•
 Making infor
mation publicly available to further improve 
waste-treatment operations, and 
•
 Enable authorities to monitor the use of substances of
 
concern in articles and initiate appropriate actions over the whole lifecycle of articles, even at the waste stage
The ECO-Products team collaborated with NXP colleagues 
in EHS, Legal, and Trade Compliance to determine NXP’s obligations regarding SCIP . Approximately 3,000 products (7% of our product portfolio) were identified and submitted to the SCIP database in the initial phase.
OTHER REGULATIONS
NXP also tracks and verifies compliance with other major legislation in the countries and regions where we operate. This includes China RoHS, California Proposition 65, EU Directive 94/62/EC for Packaging and Packaging Waste, EU POP , US TSCA, US Conflict Minerals, and Ozone-Depleting Substances in the Montreal Protocol.ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT COMPLIANCE

ROHS-COMPLIANT PRODUCTS
NXP’s RoHS-compliant semiconductor devices contain no more than 0.1% lead (Pb) by weight 
per homogeneous material, unless exempt by the RoHS Directive.
NXP’s lead-free initiative commits to the removal of lead from our entire product portfolio 
without impacting technical specifications or customer manufacturing processes. For many years, the majority of our DIP , SIL, and QFN packages have been lead-free. While most customers have shifted to lead-free products, we continue to manufacture some that contain lead for those who require it. Our customers who use NXP’s lead-containing products in their end products are responsible for declaring compliance status.HALOGEN-FREE PRODUCTS
Our goal is to maximize the number of products that are free of halogens, a chemical category that includes chlorine, bromine, and antimony. The threshold for halogen-free is set at 900 ppm at the homogeneous level
13.
LEAD-FREE AND HALOGEN-FREE PRODUCTS
We offer products that are lead-free and halogen-free because we believe it is important to develop eco-friendly products and integrate environmental safety aspects into the life-cycle  of product development.ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT COMPLIANCE

Responsible Minerals13  A product is deemed halogen-free if it contains less than 900 ppm of chlorine and bromine compounds 
combined by weight of homogeneous material. The halogens fluorine, iodine and astatine are not in scope.
EU REACH PRODUCTS
NXP products and packaging do not contain EU REACH Substances of Very High Concern 
(SVHCs) except where noted in the appendix of our EU REACH statement, which lists  the materials in our products and packaging that may contain substances in excess of  0.1% by weight. 
Together with our suppliers, we identified seven SVHCs substances in excess of 0.1% by 
weight that may be contained in some of the materials that are used in manufacturing. It was determined that the chemicals declared are in their original molecular form, are contained as a small residue within the materials, and cannot be released under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions. Nevertheless, we still declare these substances in excess of 0.1% by weight for 17.8% of our product and packaging materials
14.
WEEE-RELEVANT SUBSTANCES
The latest Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), Directive 2012/19/EU, applies to “producers” of certain electrical and electronic equipment.
We are primarily a component manufacturer, so our products are generally not considered within 
the scope of the WEEE directive until they are incorporated into a final product.
Some NXP products use plastic encapsulations that contain brominated flame retardants, which 
are considered a WEEE-relevant substance. NXP products that do not contain brominated flame retardants are easily identifiable by the Halogen-free logo on our packaging label.ELV-COMPLIANT PRODUCTS
NXP declares that our semiconductor products are designed to meet the requirements of the EU End-of-Life Vehicle (ELV) Directive 2000/53/EC and its amendments. NXP’s ELV-Compliant products do not contain cadmium, mercury, or hexavalent chromium above the allowable limits per homogeneous level. NXP’s ELV-Compliant products that contain lead meet the criteria per exemption.ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT COMPLIANCE

NXP’s responsible sourcing of minerals is an important part of our ongoing efforts to optimize 
resources and manage the environmental and social impacts of each product we design and produce. It is a priority that our products do not contain minerals derived from sources that may originate in Conflict-Affected or High-Risk Areas (CAHRAs).
The four commonly known ‘conflict minerals’ are Tin, Tungsten, Tantalum, and Gold (3T&G). 
While NXP does not generally use minerals in their raw form, nor purchase them directly from mining companies or smelters, we require our suppliers to report the smelters that source the minerals we purchase. We then validate supplier information against the list of “conflict-free” smelters, as designated by the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP). We encourage our suppliers to direct their smelters to participate in the RMAP . We monitor information from RESPONSIBLE MINERAL SOURCING

Declarationsthe Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), which records changes in smelter  status, and identifies those smelters who refuse to participate in audits, so we  can take appropriate action.
Since 2017, the systems and processes we have put in place have certified our supply-chain 
status as Conflict-Free
15. All suppliers, including contractors and external manufacturers, are 
required to comply with NXP’s Supplier Code of Conduct, which includes requirements relating to conflict minerals and responsible mineral sourcing. If a smelter becomes Non-Conformant, NXP works proactively to resolve the issue with the smelter or remove them from our supply chain. We are also looking into expanding our awareness and education within the  Global Procurement organization.
By working collaboratively with other stakeholders, we aim to create better social and economic 
conditions for mine workers and local mining communities. We also actively assist in supporting artisanal and small-scale miners on their journey to becoming responsible supply chain participants with greater access to the global market.
Obtaining data on conflict minerals requires ongoing vigilance. Our due-diligence activities  
are based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of  Minerals from CAHRAs. 
NXP continues to monitor global efforts to address and incorporate other minerals, including 
voluntary information collection and reporting processes. Our ECO-Products processes and Environment, Health and Safety Management database support our efforts to collect 100% substance information for all of our products. The database allows us to track new minerals against our portfolio of products.
NXP has chaired the World Semiconductor Council’s conflict-mineral teams since 2013 and has 
been a member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) since 2014.
As the 2021 chair of the European Partnership for Responsible Minerals (EPRM), NXP worked 
with various industries, members of government and institutions, supply chains and Civil Society Organizations (CSOs).

emissions (Scope 1), including the six Kyoto gasesTons CO
2-e 602,191 594,499 458,866 327,370 387,446

2-e 429,493 440,506 288,566 195,181 240,370
TC0201-02.04Discuss scope of reduction targets and what activities and investments are required to achieve plans, as well as any limiting factors that might affect achievement of the targets. Our stated goal for 2027 is to reduce our Scope 1 &  2 by 35% from a baseline year of 2021. Our reduction strategies differ according to the emission source, as each comes with its own unique opportunities for reduction. Limiting factors include an increase of our production space, product changes, the increase emissions that we, as a supplier, are required to adopt, or if demand changes and our emissions are directly related to an increase in volume produced.
TC0201-02.05Identify percentage of emissions within the scope of the reduction plan and the percentage reduction from base year. Identify absolute/intensity based. Identify activities that were completed during fiscal year and those that are ongoing. Discuss source of mechanism for achieving the target. Over the past decade, (baseline 2011), our normalized Scope 1 emissions decreased by 43%. PFCs are the largest contributor to our Scope 1 emissions and, since 2011, our normalized total PFC emissions have decreased by 61%, even though many of our products have become more complex, requiring additional processing steps and hence more PFCs. To achieve these results, we reduced consumption of PFC gasses, converted to lower global-warming potential gasses, and installed tools to reduce emissions.
TC0201-02.06Disclose if emissions have been recalculated or the target base year has been reset. Our new goals for 2027 have a target base year of 2021. Our calculation methods have remained the same following the methodology of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

TC0201-06.23Identify percentage of employees who are located offshore from the registrant’s country of domicile, by region.%At the end of 2021, the percentage of employees who are located offshore from NXP’s country of domicile is 18%of our workforce in the Americas, 14% in EMEA, and 61% in APAC.
NXP is a global company with operations in over 30 locations. Although headquartered in the Netherlands, NXP’s
business model is to have significant presence in the US, Europe, and Asia. This requires access to talent in thoseareas, but also allows us to be responsive and close to our customers in those markets. We view this as a strengthand not a risk.
TC0201-06.24Discuss risks, from recruiting foreign nationals or offshore employees, which may arise from immigration, naturalization, or visa regulations, loss of control,  threats to intellectual property, or cultural or political sensitivities. At NXP , we value diversity, equality and inclusion, and respect the unique experiences, backgrounds, diverse cultures and ideas of our fellow employees, business partners, and customers around the world. We understand that each employee brings something unique to the company – different viewpoints, histories, experiences, and paths of discovery. We invite every NXP employee to bring their whole self to work, without exception. NXP does not tolerate discrimination of any kind, including when making employment-related decisions. We uphold a code of business conduct and ethics and would not violate these commitments by rejecting a candidate based on citizenship or nationality. When recruiting foreign nationals in any jurisdiction, the greatest risks we face involve the uncertainties outside NXP’s control. This includes the inability or significant delay to secure export licenses from the US government; inability or significant delay to secure work authorization documents, including valid work permit and immigration status; increasing or unpredictable challenges and costs associated with obtaining necessary licenses, work authorizations, or visas; and unpredictable and shifting political positions affecting each stage in the recruitment, hiring, and retention of foreign nationals. However, these risks do not outweigh the value provided by NXP’s foreign-national employees.
TC0201-06.25Discuss Management’s approach to addressing the identified risks of recruiting foreign nationals, including efforts such as local talent pools, political lobbying for immigration reform, outsourcing of operations, or joining/forming industry partnerships. To address the risks identified in the above response, NXP does several things. We ensure that job postings include an overview of the position, including requirements and application instructions, to ensure applicants understand the position for which they are applying and the job requirements against which they will be assessed. We manage expectations around the hiring process when it comes to delays with securing work-authorization documents (such as visas). We provide, to the best of our ability, up-to-date information regarding the immigration landscape and the costs and potential risks for delays and loss of work authorization. In some countries, we also engage providers of immigration status to track initial needs for work permits, visas, and potential future renewals, and monitor for potential risk trends/developments that need to be accounted for. We engage internal and external resources to evaluate and prepare contingency plans in the event there are challenges or delays securing or maintaining work authorizations. From time to time, we participate in a variety of different initiatives and organizations, such as the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), to educate and advocate for sound policies in employment of foreign nationals and to safeguard our interests in this space.APPENDIX B – 2021 SASB DISCLOSURE

Employee Health & Safety
TC0201-07.27Discuss efforts to assess, monitor, and reduce 
exposure of employees to human health hazards. NXP assesses, monitors, and reduces exposure of our employees to human health hazards in our controls and procedures. These controls and procedures are detailed in our management system, which is certified to the ISO 45001 standard. As part of this management system, we reduce risk by conducting risk assessments. Each risk assessment we conduct generates a list of controls to limit risk. For example, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and extensive training for our employees is provided to effectively control risks identified through the risk assessment. Continuous monitoring of the documented controls is ongoing, to verify that the controls are indeed working appropriately and that the risk to employees is minimized. 
TC0201-07.28Discuss management approach in the context of short- and long-term risks. The management system described above, combined with our continuous monitoring of each in-place control, serves to minimize both the short- and long-term risks identified by our risk assessments.
TC0201-07.29Discuss risk assessments, participation in long-term health studies, ambient-air monitoring in clean rooms, implementation of technology to control worker exposure, worker use of personal protective equipment, automation of processes, and phasing out, substituting, or using alternative materials. We monitor the ambient air in clean rooms and have safety professionals, including an onsite industrial hygienist, at all our manufacturing sites. We provide PPE for our employees and continuously invest in automation processes to reduce risks to our employees.
TC0201-07.30Discuss Health & Safety measures in general and, in particular, measures taken to protect clean-room workers in fabrication plants. We emphasize Health & Safety in all areas of the company, including a focus on work/life balance and proper ergonomic tools and training.

TC0201-09.38Discuss approach to managing the use of any substances listed as declarable substance groups or declarable substances in IEC 62474, including specific operational processes which take these substances into account. The IEC 62474 list of declarable substances is mainly based on EU legislation (EU RoHS, EU REACH Annex XVII, EU REACH, Candidate list, and EU POP). NXP meets or exceeds all of these legislated guidelines.
The requirements for substance management are outlined in the ECO-Products Substance Control for Products 
and Packaging (NXPOMS-1719007347-1991) document. https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/supporting-information/ECO-Products-Substance-Control-Products-Packaging.pdf.
We require our suppliers to provide a full Material Content Declaration (“MCD”, in IPC-1752A format) 
for each component. Our internal system checks each supplier MCD and then calculates the compliance status of the components and products to the legal, industry, and NXP requirements described in the NXPOMS-1719007347-1991 document.
Nickel (a declarable IEC 62474 substance and skin sensitizer) is a common substance in lead frames and plating, 
which are items integrated into our products and not intended for direct skin contact.
Our products and materials are clearly identifiable by a unique, 12-digit numerical code (12NC) and managed via 
the NXP data-management system. This system segregates and prevents mixing of RoHS-compliant and non-compliant materials according to their usage in the final product. Traceability of non-compliant materials and parts is guaranteed via the NXPOMS-1719007347-2601 Traceability Requirement. The storage of materials is regulated by local organization. Specific information related to these materials, including the supplier, is maintained in the NXP Master Data Management system. In the SAP-BW system, NXP maintains the connection between the 12NC of the material and its supplier.
Lines are clearly marked as RoHS (lead-free) or leaded terminations. Products are certified as RoHS (lead-free) 
or leaded terminations. GENESIS Production flow papers also indicate which segregated line to follow and the components allowed for the build.

TC0201-12.54Define how we determine our suppliers and any third-party smelters to be conflict-free. We conform with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chain from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas, and we expect our suppliers to adhere to these same requirements. Suppliers must also adhere to NXP’s Supplier Code of Conduct and provide, upon request, the source and chain of custody of minerals as well as their due-diligence policies and measures. To verify compliance with these commitments, NXP conducts third-party audits. https://www.nxp.com/pip/CONFLICT-MINERALS
NXP is a member of the Responsible Mineral Initiative (RMI). We validate supplier information against the list 
of “conflict-free” smelters, as designated by the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP). The RMAP standards are developed to meet the requirements of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance, Regulation (EU) 2017/821 of the European Parliament, and the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. We encourage our suppliers to direct their smelters to participate in the RMAP . We monitor information from the RMI, which records changes in smelter status and identifies those smelters who refuse to participate in audits, so we can take appropriate action.APPENDIX B – 2021 SASB DISCLOSURE

TC0201-13.56Summarize our strategic approach to 
managing risks associated with the use of critical materials and conflict minerals in our products, including availability, access, price, and reputational risks. Our procurement organization has implemented escalation procedures for suppliers who (i) provide products that incorporate Covered Minerals from smelters or refiners who do not comply with a third-party audit program or (ii) have not provided details on the sourcing of Covered Minerals in their supply chain. Under these procedures, our procurement organization develops a list of corrective actions, including a timeline for compliance and a decision to continue or temporarily suspend trade with the supplier during the period of corrective action. Suppliers who do not make satisfactory progress addressing the identified corrective actions are reported to NXP’s Chief Procurement Officer. NXP’s due-diligence measures, with respect to identified smelters and refiners, are primarily based on multi-industry due-diligence initiatives. These measures evaluate the procurement practices of the smelters and refiners that process and provide Covered Minerals to our supply chain. 
TC0201-13.57Identify which materials and minerals present a risk to our operations, the type of risk they represent, and the strategies used to mitigate that risk. NXP’s supply chain is complex. In most cases, there are a number of third parties in the supply chain between NXP’s ultimate manufacture of the Covered Products and the original sources of Covered Minerals. We require our suppliers to identify the smelters and refiners of Covered Minerals in their supply chain. In most cases, our suppliers report this information using the broadly adopted Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT) developed by Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), a multi-industry initiative consisting of over 400 companies and industry associations. Due to the complexity of our supply chain, we rely on our suppliers for the accuracy and completeness of this information. In most cases, our suppliers submit a consolidated Smelter & Refiner report for all of their products and materials, not just those provided to NXP .
TC0201-13.58Discuss relevant strategies, including diversification of suppliers, stockpiling of materials, expenditures in R&D for alternative and substitute materials, and investments in recycling technology for critical materials. Procurement’s risk-mitigation strategy is to have multiple suppliers qualified for one part whenever possible. That way, if we permanently or temporarily suspend trade with a supplier, we can switch to an alternate source. In cases where this is not possible, we compensate for this with buffer inventory and other methods of stock management. In the case of onboarding new direct materials, suppliers must submit a Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT). If the supplier uses a nonconformant smelter, we do not qualify the supplier until the issue is resolved. This process is reviewed and monitored by the Material Sourcing Board.APPENDIX B – 2021 SASB DISCLOSURE

TC0201-13.59Discuss due-diligence practices, supply-chain 
auditing, supply-chain engagement, and partnerships with industry groups or non-governmental development organizations. We believe that engagement and active cooperation with other industry members with whom we share suppliers can help us identify risks in our supply chain. In particular, it helps us identify smelters and refiners and assess their due-diligence practices.
In 2014, NXP joined the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), formerly known as the Electronic Industry 
Citizenship Coalition (EICC). Among other important social-responsibility initiatives, the RBA promotes responsible sourcing of minerals. NXP currently holds a position on the RBA’s Board of Directors.
NXP is also a member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), so NXP representatives regularly collaborate 
with other industry members on complementary programs and initiatives. Over the years, NXP has been an active member of the RMI’s working groups and Steering Committee.
In 2016, NXP joined the European Partnership for Responsible Minerals (EPRM) as a strategic partner. The EPRM 
is a multi-stakeholder partnership in which governments, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), and the private sector work together to create better social and economic conditions for mine workers and local mining communities, by increasing the number of mines that adopt responsible mining practices in Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (CAHRA). Participation provides tools to map the minerals and verify that smelters and refiners source minerals ethically. Our engagement with EPRM not only includes due-diligence platforms and tools, but also provides support for “on the ground” projects at small-scale mining sites that have been identified as CAHRAs.
Since 2013, NXP has chaired the Conflict Minerals Team of the World Semiconductor Council (WSC).

APPENDIX C – 2021 TASK FORCE ON CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES (TCFD) 
If greenhouse-gas emissions continue at current rates, global warming will accelerate, and temperature gains above 2°C (relative to the pre-industrial period) would have catastrophic economic  
and social consequences. 
The growing demand for decision-useful, climate-related information from organizations across all sectors of the economy has given rise to several disclosure standards that support greater 
accountability and transparency. One such standard, established in 2015, is the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which defines a set of voluntary disclosures of climate-related financial risk. Using the TCFD format, companies can inform stakeholders of any risks relating to climate change that they face.
The TCFD structures their recommendations around four themes that represent core elements of how organizations operate: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.This is our first time including the TCFD’s recommendations in our Sustainability Report. While we discuss risks related to climate-related matters, we do not include all the risks that may ultimately 
affect NXP in this regard. We will conduct more in-depth scenario analysis and will include the results in future reports. Some risks that are as yet unknown, or are believed not to be material, could ultimately have a major impact on our businesses, objectives, revenues, income, assets, liquidity, and/or capital resources.

In addition to the Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) Management Board, NXP also has an Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) Management Board, which includes members of the Management Team and other senior leaders. The Nominating and Governance Committee is updated on these efforts on a quarterly basis by representatives of the ESG Management Board, and reports on these efforts in the plenary meetings of NXP’s Board of Directors.   The ESG and EHS Management Boards are responsible for setting the vision and strategy and for approving goals and resourcing. The efforts of the ESG and EHS Management Boards are supported by NXP’s Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Chief Technology and Operations Officer, and representatives from Investor Relations, Legal, Human Resources, the Sustainability Office, Facilities and EHS councils (which include senior managers from our worldwide sites), the Business Continuity Management Office, and the Insurance and Risk Management Department.  While the ESG and EHS Management Boards approve the strategy and targets, the Sustainability and EHS Office focuses on policies, goals, program development, and measurable improvement plans, all while monitoring and controlling operational functions.  The Sustainability and EHS Office meets regularly with the ESG and EHS Management Boards to discuss and review NXP’s performance.   The EHS corporate team sets targets, conducts annual self-assessments and third-party audits, ensures timely closure of corrective-action plans, monitors and controls working hours and rest days, and conducts internal capacity building.  The Site Steering Committee teams implement, measure, and validate policies, drive continuous improvement at their respective sites, and report progress to Site Management and the EHS corporate team.

Strategy
Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization’s businesses, strategy, and financial planning where such information is material.
a. 
 Describe the climate-
r
elated risks and 
opportunities the organization has identified over the short, medium, and long term.NXP has identified several climate-related risks and opportunities, which are generally described below. This is not a comprehensive list. NXP plans to further evaluate these risks and opportunities and the associated business impacts. As a result of our climate-related governance, risk management, and metrics and targets programs, NXP’s strategy for climate-related risks and opportunities is resilient and able to react to changing factors over time. The programs are inter-related and provide regular and ongoing feedback to one other, so NXP can continuously improve the reduction of risk and the realization of opportunity.  Semiconductor manufacturing is heavily dependent on electricity and water. Climate-related events may compromise the availability of electricity and/or water needed for manufacturing.  Regulation: NXP business operations and supply-chain partners have a risk from increased climate-related regulations which may increase operational costs and limit the use of chemicals key to the manufacture of semiconductors.  Reputation & Market Share: NXP has both risk (through inaction) and opportunity (through action) for climate-related reputation and market-share factors. NXP is proactively identifying and acting on goals to contribute to the global effort to reduce climate-related impact. This also provides an opportunity to make more stakeholders aware of NXP’s commitments and progress in this area. As more supply-chain partners, employees, potential employees, customers, investors, and members of the public become aware of our work in this area, there is the opportunity to contribute more positives to the company’s reputation and market share.  Operations & Financial: NXP has both risk and opportunity for climate-related operational factors. Through our goals to reduce our carbon footprint, by reducing electricity and water usage and increasing our rate of recycling/reusing waste, NXP may realize operational cost savings and efficiencies. NXP also has risks to operations as a result of more severe weather events and/or natural disasters, which can directly impact our factory operations, physical assets, and supply chain. The resulting impacts to our capital expenditures may or may not result in the desired climate-related improvements. These climate-related factors are taken as inputs into quarterly expense and capital financial planning.b.

We have begun to include climate-related risks within these assessments, and also within our Enterprise Risk Management program. We will expand on this during 2022. Risks are prioritized at the corporate and local levels for their scope and operational controls, and are reviewed annually. Updates are completed through risk-assessment reviews and with inputs from executive EHS board meetings, management reviews, functional staff meetings, and specialized councils. Existing and emerging regulatory requirements are taken as inputs to the risk assessments, as are benchmarks from other companies and other stakeholder input received from customers, investors, and the public.APPENDIX C – 2021 TASK FORCE ON CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES (TCFD)

b.  Disclose Scope 1, Scope 
2, and, if appr
opriate, 
Scope 3 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, and related risks.Semiconductor manufacturing is not considered a major contributor to global warming, but our operations do directly and indirectly emit Greenhouse Gases (GHGs). The three main contributors to our carbon footprint are emissions from purchased electricity, the emission of PerFluoroCarbons (PFCs), and emission of Heat-Transfer Fluids (HTFs). We set reduction targets on these three contributors as they are essential for NXP operations.  Scope 1 emissions includes an in-depth, ten-year analysis of our PFC, HTF, fossil-fuel, and N
2O emissions.  
 Scope 2 emissions includes a ten-year analysis for electricity from our manufacturing and non-manufacturing facilities.  Scope 3 emissions includes a ten-year analysis for business travel and product transportation. We are working to enhance our collection of data related to this metric, with the goal of better understanding our suppliers’ carbon impacts, starting with our key top-tier suppliers.  Our discussion of our three biggest contributors to emissions — electricity, PFCs, and HTFs — includes a detailed description of how NXP measures and manages identified risks and opportunities.   Emission calculations follow the methodology of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Scope 2 emissions are calculated using the market-based methodology.  We make all emission data available in our annual Corporate Sustainability Report or on our website.
c. Describe the targets used by the organization to manage climate-related risks and opportunities, and the organization’s performance against these targets.
The discussion of our three biggest contributors to emissions — electricity, PFCs, and HTFs — includes a detailed description of how NXP measures and manages identified risks and opportunities.   Key climate-related targets related to GHG emissions include the following:  Targets for Scope 1 reduction address PFC and HTF emissions. At present, our constraints consist of no viable alternatives for the PFCs or HTFs used to etch integrated circuitry onto silicon wafers, clean the internal chambers of deposition equipment, and test products during the manufacturing process.  Targets for Scope 2 reduction address electricity use and an increase in renewable energy. Our current constraint is that semiconductor manufacturing is an electricity-intensive process. Renewable energy is not always readily available at every site, so we use a mix of energy sources for flexibility and reliability. We are steadily increasing our use of electricity that comes from renewable sources, and we continue to look for new ways to increase our use of reliable renewable energy sources.   We work to reduce emissions through process elimination or chemical substitution (where feasible), through process optimization, and by increasing abatement.  We make our climate-related data available in our annual Corporate Sustainability Report or on our website.
Looking Forward
We recognize the importance of global ambitions to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and the increasing momentum in policy, technology, finance, and corporate commitments toward this goal. We have enhanced our transparency for the sustainability characteristics of our products and R&D investments and set carbon neutrality goals for our operations.

This document includes forward-looking statements which include statements regarding NXP’s 
business strategy, carbon emissions, energy consumption, water consumption, and other environmental targets, external ESG commitments, and workplace diversity goals as well as any other statements which are not historical facts. By their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to numerous factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to be materially different from those projected. These factors, risks and uncertainties include the following: the duration and spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume; market demand and semiconductor industry conditions; the ability to successfully introduce new technologies and products; the demand for the goods into which NXP’s products are incorporated; trade disputes between the U.S. and China, potential increase of barriers to international trade and resulting disruptions to NXP’s established supply chains; the ability to generate sufficient cash, raise sufficient capital or refinance corporate debt at or before maturity to meet both NXP’s debt service and research and development and capital investment requirements; the ability to accurately estimate demand and match manufacturing production capacity accordingly or obtain supplies from third-party producers; the potential impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 on NXP’s business, operations, results of operations, financial condition, workforce or the operations or decisions of customers, suppliers or business customers; the access to production capacity from third-party outsourcing partners and any events that might affect their business or NXP’s relationship with them including the outbreak of COVID-19 or the requirements to suspend activities with customers or suppliers because of changing import and export regulations; the ability to secure adequate and timely supply of equipment and materials from suppliers; the ability to avoid operational problems and product defects and, if such issues were to arise, to correct them quickly; the ability to form strategic partnerships and joint ventures and to successfully cooperate with alliance partners; the ability to win competitive bid selection processes; the ability to develop products for use in customers’ equipment and products; the ability to successfully hire and retain key management and senior product engineers; and, the ability to maintain good relationships with NXP’s suppliers. In addition, this document contains information concerning the semiconductor industry and NXP’s market and business segments generally, which is forward-looking in nature and is based on a variety of assumptions regarding the ways in which the semiconductor industry and NXP’s market and business segments may develop. NXP has based these assumptions on information currently available, if any one or more of these assumptions turn out to be incorrect, actual results may differ from those predicted. While NXP does not know what impact any such differences may have on its business, if there are such differences, its future results of operations and its financial condition could be materially adversely affected. There can be no assurances that a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of a contagious diseases, such as COVID-19, will not have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition in the future.

Except for any ongoing obligation to disclose material information as required by the United States federal securities laws, NXP does not have any intention or obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after we distribute this document, whether to reflect any future events or circumstances or otherwise.
