Caesars EntertainmentWELCOME FROM  
OUR LEADERS
At Caesars Entertainment, we are driven to Create the 
Extraordinary—in our business and in the communities in  which we operate. We believe that with a focus on service,  a willingness to forge new paths and a commitment to moving forward together, we can create incredible experiences, cultivate opportunity and make a difference for our guests,  Team Members and the world around us. 
As we reflect on a year driven by change, we are pleased 
to share our 202 1-2022 Corporate Social Responsibility Report. In it, you’ll learn about the reinvestments we are making in communities across the country. From renovations and expansions to rebranding and entirely new resorts, our hospitality destination lineup is only improving. We’ll give you insight into our growing digital presence following an incredible launch year for Caesars Sportsbook. As we catapult into a leadership position in mobile sports betting, we’re prioritizing living up to our legacy of putting responsible play front and center in the online gaming space. 
You’ll also see the strategic shifts we’ve made to clarify our 
approach to CSR. Buoyed by the momentum across our business, we took a fresh look at our CSR plans and goals, digging in to identify our critical stakeholders and what we  need to prioritize to continue to succeed in delivering on  those goals. After considerable examination, we’ve identified priority areas, both new and old, where what we do has the most impact on society and the environment and where we  can make the most difference. We’ve also spent some time thinking about our greatest potential Environmental, Social and Governance risks—the things we need to focus on to live up to our mission and protect the long-term stability of our business.  With this refreshed understanding of what’s most important,  we are newly energized to drive growth in our business responsibly and ethically. Our North Star in the CSR space remains our Code of Commitment which we developed more than 20 years ago, outlining our pledge to do business responsibly. We remain committed to our PEOPLE PLANET PLAY framework to align our priorities and as a lens through which to consider our actions.  Our Family-Style Service culture anchors our PEOPLE strategy creating a sense of belonging and ensuring a focus on supporting the wellbeing of our Team Members, guests and local communities. Under the PLANET umbrella, our commitment to caring for our world is bolstered by real-time, actionable goals around sustainability and environmental impact.  As North America’s largest gaming entertainment company, PLAY is our foundation. We constantly invest and innovate  to create extraordinary experiences for our guests and  provide resources to help them play responsibly. 
Whether contributing to climate change mitigation, advancing 
diversity, equity and inclusion, volunteering in our communities or creating best practices around Responsible Gaming, we are proud of our progress and excited about our future. We invite you to read about all of this and more in the pages of this  CSR Report. 
Thank you for your interest.

UPDATE FROM  
THE CSR COMMITTEE
Over the last year, Caesars Entertainment has continued to 
redefine its CSR strategy, emphasizing the evolution of its PEOPLE PLANET PLAY framework and the meaningful impact it can have on all stakeholders. As an integral part of the process, the CSR Committee of the Board of Directors is fully engaged and supportive of the Company’s leadership and its vision of building a comprehensive program that creates a better tomorrow for the business, our Team Members and the communities in which we operate. 
After years of change in our Company and business 
environment, the need to calibrate our CSR priorities and provide relevancy to today’s business landscape was clear. Our leadership did not view this as a simple analytical exercise—they engaged deeply to ensure that diverse internal and external voices across our properties and corporate functions were heard and valued. The CSR Committee feels very confident in both the process and the outcomes it delivered.  
First, an analysis of the stakeholder groups that are most 
significant to Caesars Entertainment was completed through an interactive process that involved the organization’s leadership at many levels. The focus was to understand how our business impacts different stakeholder groups as well as the way they influence our business. The resulting stakeholder map will help Caesars Entertainment target stakeholder interactions effectively and be more intentional about engagement. 
 Second, assessing our most material CSR topics, drawing from 
a broad scope of internal and external resources, enabled insightful discussion about the relative importance of a host of CSR-related issues. Although the resulting list of nearly two dozen CSR priority topics is a long one, we recognize this represents a full set of topics that must be at the heart of our PEOPLE PLANET PLAY deliverables. 
Third, an analysis of CSR topics from an ESG risk perspective 
helped focus on the CSR issues that are likely to be most meaningful to shareholders and investors, which must be managed effectively through our risk management processes.  
Finally, articulating a series of CSR-related policy positions 
further enhances our transparency as an organization, aligns our understanding of the current status and outlines expectations of future actions in several areas. 
With an appreciation for the significant investment by Caesars 
Entertainment’s leadership team, we believe the Company is in a solid position to continue the optimistic pace of CSR activities in a now very different world than just a few years ago. While primarily focused on our stakeholder assessment, our committee remains committed to reviewing the Company’s performance against our public CSR targets, primarily on diversity, equity and inclusion and climate change mitigation. We also spent significant time working with Caesars Entertainment’s External CSR Advisory Council to ensure we are abreast of current and emerging trends.Today, Caesars Entertainment remains anchored in its core values, guided by the Code of Commitment and motivated to create value for our Team Members, guests, communities and society in general. Our review of this 202 1-2022 CSR Report reminded us how many different dimensions of our activities touch so many people in so many positive ways. We are encouraged by the progress made, mindful of the many tasks ahead and grateful for the partnership of more than 50,000 Team Members whose dedication is always inspiring.
Sincerely, CSR Committee 
Jan Jones Blackhurst (Chair) Don Kornstein Courtney Mather

OUR  
GOVERNANCE
We aim to maintain a Board of Directors experienced in 
areas needed to guide our business effectively, as well as a representative of diverse groups. Key areas of Board expertise relevant to Caesars Entertainment include finance and accounting, knowledge of gaming, marketing and hospitality industries, risk,  
IT and cybersecurity, and familiarity with ESG risks and practices.  
Board Committees
The Board is served by four standing committees composed of independent directors: Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Corporate Governance and the CSR Committee. All Committee charters can be found on our website.  The CSR Committee 
supports the Board’s fulfillment of its responsibilities to help deliver our corporate mission, CSR strategy and CSR-related elements of corporate governance, such as board diversity, board education and more. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also closely supports board diversity efforts.
Board Engagement in CSR
Caesars Entertainment’s Board of Directors maintains a high level of engagement throughout the year on matters relating to CSR. As part of its ongoing education on ESG, the Board of Directors, through the leadership of its CSR Committee, continues to interact with and learn from internal and external experts on critical  
CSR topics. In particular, the Board frequently interacts with Caesars’ External CSR Advisory Council and other experts  
for updates and insights on new developments and trends.  
Further, the Board conducts an annual review of our performance against our CSR goals and target-setting for new goals.
In 202 1-2022, the Board was engaged in our strategic 
stakeholder engagement mapping, materiality analysis and ESG risk assessment. It approved all outcomes and materials for publication (see section: CSR Strategy: PEOPLE PLANET PLAY). The CSR Committee of the Board of Directors reviewed and approved this CSR Report and all related disclosures.New Public Policy Positions
In 2022, following our CSR materiality assessment (see section: CSR Material Topics), we decided to further enhance our transparency by publishing position statements on key CSR topics for the benefit of all stakeholders.

GOVERNANCE
Oversight of our PEOPLE PLANET PLAY CSR strategy 
rests with Heather Rapp, Senior Vice President of Corporate Social Responsibility. Rapp reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer, Tom Reeg and plays a key role with the CSR Committee. She is supported by a diverse team of CSR specialists.
Operational execution of PEOPLE PLANET PLAY is driven 
through a companywide network of property leaders, functional leads and CSR-related teams covering, for example, Responsible Gaming, CodeGreen (environmental action), HERO network (Team Member volunteering), diverse Business Impact Groups (BIGs) and philanthropy, including the Caesars Foundation.
ESG RISK MANAGEMENT
We take a proactive approach to risk prevention, deploy processes to anticipate high-risk exposure areas and take steps to mitigate identified risks. Our Internal Audit department defines an annual audit plan based on an examination of issues and other organizational priorities, which is reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Subsequent audit results are shared with the Audit Committee and action plans are established to address findings and mitigate relevant risks. 
In 2022, we completed a comprehensive ESG risk assessment, 
which informed our risk planning processes.
ESG Risk: An environmental, social or governance event or condition that, if it 
occurs, could cause an actual or a potential material negative impact on the value of the investment arising from an adverse sustainability impact.“From my first day  with the company 
25 years ago, I knew Caesars 
Entertainment took its commitment  to 
Corporate Social Responsibility seriously. 
Our passion  for bettering our business, 
Team Members and surrounding 
communities can be seen in all  
we do  at our 50 properties across the 
organization. In my new role as Senior 
Vice President of CSR, I’m working closely 
with our leadership team, Team Members, 
suppliers, partners and advisors to 
ensure Caesars Entertainment 
moves forward  in its commitment to 
building a more diverse company.”Heather Rapp

GOVERNANCE
Our ESG risk assessment determined the topics that have the 
potential to influence our ability to create value over time for  our shareholders and investors, by examining ESG material topics from a business and financial risk standpoint. The ESG risk assessment was completed following our stakeholder mapping and CSR materiality assessment (see section: CSR Strategy: PEOPLE PLANET PLAY). It assessed ESG risks using a set of considerations that included scale, scope, remediation possibilities, likelihood, current issues and assessment of existing risk protection mechanisms. We identified eight ESG risks that, if not effectively addressed, could potentially affect Caesars Entertainment’s financial value creation over time. These are (in alphabetical order):
1. Anti-Corruption

 Climate Change

significant time  talking to our top 
investors about ESG risk assessment and 
management and the value Caesars 
Entertainment holds  in these areas. 
Their questions about climate change, 
diversity, equity and inclusion 
targets and governance matters  
have shaped our review of ESG risks and 
how we will conduct business moving 
forward . Throughout this report, our 
investors will see our priority  ESG risks 
further reflect their interests. ”

“Companies that take a strategic  
approach  to addressing environmental, 
social and governance matters are better 
able to protect themselves from risk and 
deliver better outcomes for society.  
Having supported and advised Caesars  
Entertainment for the past several years, 
I see a clear long-term approach  
to CSR  that’s driven by values as well as 
business need. This combination has helped 
Caesars remain at the top  of the

STAKEHOLDER  
ENGAGEMENT
Caesars Entertainment aims to address the needs and 
expectations of stakeholders in a responsible, accountable and transparent manner. We believe that engaging with stakeholders is good for our business and improves our ability to deliver favorable results for them and for the broader needs of society and the environment in general. Our approach is based on defining our core stakeholder groups and establishing engagement strategies tailored to each group’s needs relative to their relationship with our business. We aim to engage with stakeholders in a targeted way regularly. 
In 202 1-2022, we identified the stakeholder groups relevant 
to Caesars Entertainment to reinforce and systematize our ongoing engagement. We distinguish between internal and external stakeholders:
INTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS
These are our Team Members, their families and Caesars Entertainment’s Board of Directors. They are the individuals who direct, lead and run our business every day and are critical to its functioning. They have a dual role: as stakeholders in their own right and as the conduit through which Caesars Entertainment engages and interacts with external stakeholders. For our internal stakeholders to perform this role effectively, their needs must be understood and respected in an attentive and meaningful way.
EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS
External stakeholders are as diverse as society itself and we  aim to be a positive force in the lives of all those we reach.  We identified nine primary external stakeholder groups that represent the diverse voices of influence on our business. Our nine external stakeholder groups are (in alphabetical order):
• Academia
•
 Bank
s, investors and analysts
•
 Business par
tners, suppliers and contractors
•
 Guests and customer
s 
•
 Hospitalit
y and gaming industry

CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT CSR MATERIAL TOPICS 2022
For details of our process, topic evaluations and definitions of all material topics, 
please see Caesars Entertainment’s 2022 ESG Materiality Assessment.
ADVANCING THE UNITED NATIONS  
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS)
In determining our material topics, we also assessed the global 2030 goals defined by the  United Nations SDGs. Through our activities, we specifically advance 1 5 of the 1 7 SDGs, aligning with more than 40 of the 169 global SDG targets that support the goals. To learn more about the way we support the SDGs, please see Caesars Entertainment’s 2022 ESG Materiality Assessment.CSR 
MATERIAL TOPICS
In early 2022, we conducted a comprehensive CSR Materiality 
Assessment to evaluate our materiality assumptions following the 
company merger in 2020. We also used the assessment period 
to review our business transformations following the COVID-1 9 
pandemic, along with the elevated expectations related to 
social justice and CSR. 
With the help of an external specialist, our assessment gathered 
input from internal and external stakeholders, reviewed multiple industry and ESG disclosures, standards and frameworks 
and yielded more than 500 individual topics. We combined 
like-topics into clusters and evaluated each using a stakeholder-
weighted approach to determine the impact on society, the 
environment and the degree of influence on stakeholder decisions. The process yielded 2 1 material topics.
“The Materiality Assessment was an opportunity  for 
our leadership to discuss how we create value and identify what 
matters most to our stakeholders.  Not only did we develop a 
priority list of areas to focus on, we now have a more precise and 
meaningful understanding  of our CSR goals and the change 
we need to enact.”

EXPERIENCE
We strive to inspire our Team Members through our mission, 
vision and values, providing a welcoming, respectful, caring 
and safe workplace. At Caesars Entertainment, we do more 
than our daily tasks; we Create the Extraordinary for our guests, 
communities and Team Members. See our Position on Team 
Member Experience.
ENGAGEMENT
In early 2022, we launched our first comprehensive “All-In, We 
Win” Team Member survey to gain insights into what drives our 
Team Members’ happiness and success at work. Our annual 
survey is also supported by targeted “pulse” surveys covering 
specific topics throughout the year.
More than 1 7 ,000 active Team Members participated in our 
2022 survey with an overall Engagement Index Score of 76. 1%, 
a 2.9% increase over the 73.2% Engagement Index score 
from our pulse survey in 202 1. The Engagement Index is an 
aggregate of survey score responses to six questions that are considered key indicators of engagement.FAMILY-STYLE SERVICE
As part of our commitment to going All-In On Service,  
Caesars Entertainment strives to treat our customers and  
Team Members like family. In 202 1, we launched our 
companywide Family-Style Service training program to ensure everyone embraced and understood our Family-Style Service 
behaviors—Be Proactive; Make it Fun; Own the Experience.  
By the end of 2022, all Team Members will have completed  
this comprehensive training session.“These scores are very encouraging and 
demonstrate a strong level of Team 
Member engagement  that will 
help fuel our growth  in the coming 
years. As our first Team Member survey 
post-merger, we now have a baseline 
for building and reinforcing our 
culture  and a better understanding of 
how we can drive deeper engagement 
with our most valuable asset, our Team 
Members. This is just one of many tools 
we’re using to help deliver exceptional 
results for our workforce.”

REWARDS AND RECOGNITION
Our compensation and benefits programs are designed to 
attract, retain and motivate our Team Members. In addition 
to competitive salaries and wages, we provide and seek 
to continually improve short-term, long-term and incentive-
based compensation programs to reward performance and 
contribution. Our Total Return program, for example, enables eligible Team Members to earn cash-equivalent bonuses 
for outstanding performance, which can be redeemed for 
merchandise, travel, entertainment and event tickets. In 202 1, 
our Team Members earned over $5. 1 million worth of Total 
Return credits. For more details about compensation and 
benefits, see our Position on Team Member Experience.
In 202 1, we also rolled out our new benefits and wellbeing 
program to Team Members—see details in the section: 
Team Member Safety & Wellness.
Beyond compensation, we aim to inspire our Team Members 
to live our values and contribute in meaningful ways to deliver 
our mission of Creating the Extraordinary. We do this through 
reward and recognition programs that celebrate achievements 
and highlight best practices we can all learn from.
Using our Total Return e-Card platform, managers and Team 
Members sent 1 .3 million recognition notes to each other in 
202 1 , showing appreciation for their efforts and contributions.
New Educational Assistance for Team Members
In 2022, we announced an all-new education assistance 
program for our Team Members in the U.S. The “All-In 
On Education” program reflects Caesars Entertainment’s 
commitment to developing greater educational resources  
for our Team Members and their families. Expanding our existing tuition assistance program, All-In On Education provides up to $5,250 per calendar year in tuition 
funding for qualifying full-time Team Members and $2,625 for 
part-time Team Members. This is supported by:
•
 
 A dedicated academic advisor for T
eam Member applicants 
and a vast list of school providers offering low- to no-cost education opportunities with partner schools;
•
 A new student loan debt repayment benefit of $5
,250  
per calendar year for qualifying full-time Team Members and $2,625 for part-time Team Members; and
•
 A 5
29 college savings plan provides tax advantage 
savings for Team Members to save for their dependents’ education expenses.
In addition, The Don Carano Legacy Scholarship for 
dependents of Team Members offers up to $20,000 over four 
years for selected applicants. The scholarship was created in honor of founder Don Carano as a tribute to his passion  
for the gaming industry and the family values shared by all  
Team Members. In the first year of the program, 1 10 Team 
Members applied for this scholarship and 22 scholarships  
were awarded.
Our New Caesars Founders Awards
In mid-2022, we celebrated our first-ever Caesars Founders 
Award winners, recognizing the contributions of 1 8 Team 
Members selected from our diverse workforce across  
the enterprise. The Awards celebrated the accomplishments 
of our most extraordinary Team Members who exemplify our 
values in their daily work. The winners received cash awards 
and an all-inclusive VIP trip for two to Caesars Palace in  
Las Vegas, complete with limo service, a VIP luncheon at 
Gordon Ramsay’s HELL’S KITCHEN  and a celebratory gala.

RECRUITMENT AND DEVELOPMENT
We aim to equip our Team Members with the knowledge, 
skills and tools to perform their roles effectively. This means 
providing basic training in all necessary on-the-job skills, 
including Responsible Gaming, corporate essentials such as 
ethics, compliance, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, as well 
as programs for personal and professional development and growth.
In 202 1, Caesars Entertainment Team Members * engaged  
in more than 1 .3 million hours of training, averaging more  
than 26 hours per Team Member for the year.
*Direct employees in the U.S. For definition, see GRI 102-8 in the GRI Data Tables.
In 202 1-2022, we progressed several leadership and 
development programs for Team Members at different stages of their employment and career cycle, enhancing our hiring outreach and programs.
National Day of Hiring   
Our inaugural nationwide single-day hiring event in early 
2022 was an overwhelming success across the enterprise. 
We brought together teams from 40 property locations to 
support the hiring event, representing 75% of our properties 
nationwide and Caesars Digital. We saw unprecedented participation from hundreds of property-based hiring managers 
and Human Resources Team Members for the largest hiring event in our history.Additionally, to support hiring initiatives across the enterprise, 
we launched a new Careers website in January 2022. The site 
includes valuable information on company culture, benefits, 
open positions and an invitation to apply. The site highlights our commitment to CSR, including diversity, equity and inclusion and we welcome candidates from all backgrounds to consider 
joining our Company.
“Successfully executing a nationwide hiring 
event wouldn’t be possible without our talented 
Human Resources teams and hiring managers. 
We placed more than 700 candidates  
with new jobs in a matter of hours while securing 
a second interview for hundreds more. To say this 
was an incredible achievement  would be 
an understatement. Our goal now is to make this 
an annual event.”

Emerging Leaders Program 
This program was launched to provide high-performing Team 
Members at the manager and director level the opportunity to 
expand their company knowledge and develop new skillsets. 
The year-long program focuses on professional development, 
networking, exposure, advancement and diversity. 1 53 Team 
Members participated in the program in 202 1, after which 1 5% 
were promoted to leadership roles by mid-year 2022, including 
nine women and nine people of color, demonstrating our 
inclusive approach to talent development across the Company.In 2022,we collaborated with the National Organization  
of Black Law Enforcement Executives (NOBLE) to create  
a development program for security personnel.  
This profession is often underrepresented in corporate 
development programs. Eight security staff at our properties 
participated in a five-day program over five weeks to  
develop their skills. This is the first training event of its kind 
conducted by NOBLE in a non-law-enforcement setting  
and the first targeted program for our security professionals.New Enterprise Internship Program 
Our new internship program supports college students who 
want to experience our industry before they graduate.  
Open to post-secondary students, the program offers a  
1 2-week experience in which interns come together as a 
cohort in different working environments across Caesars 
Entertainment. Internships will run in tandem across all regions, 
with adaptations to meet student and local hiring needs.  
Outreach to potential interns is supported through partnerships 
across our national network of colleges and universities. 
The first cohort of 1 7 interns commenced in June 2022.

21We believe the key to an inclusive culture and effective DEI practice is awareness. By making inclusion an open, legitimate, necessary 
and frequent topic of conversation in our workplace, we aim to ensure that all our Team Members understand that DEI is a conscious 
choice to welcome and embrace differences and respect all as equals.*Leadership roles include supervisors and above. Mid-level leadership roles include supervisors and managers. Senior leadership roles include Directors,  
Vice Presidents, Senior Vice Presidents and C-Suite. Targets cover direct employees in the U.S. For definition, see GRI 102-8 in the GRI Data Tables.

Racial/Ethnic: 50% of leadership roles* will be held by  
people of color. We also commit to increasing the  representation of people of color in senior leadership by 50%.43%  in leadership roles
19 %  in senior leadership roles
DIVERSITY, EQUITY  
AND INCLUSION 
We embrace diversity and aim to create an inclusive  
working environment that celebrates all our Team Members  
as individuals. Our diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) 
framework identifies five pillars of commitment, embedding  
DEI in everything we do:
•
 T
eam Members: Hiring diverse Team Members, 
further enhancing inclusion and equity in  our workplaces.
•
 Guests:
 Tailored offerings for diverse guests, 
conventions and leisure group organizers, with an emphasis on marketing to different needs.  
•
 Communities:
 Volunteer initiatives, charitable 
contributions, partnerships and social programs with diverse community groups. 
•
 Suppliers:
 Diversity in procurement and advancing 
diverse suppliers and contractors.

DIVERSITY, EQUITY  
AND INCLUSION 
Two years ago, we began unconscious bias training for our 
Team Member population, including our senior executives and 
Board of Directors. Since that launch, we’ve worked to expand 
our training program for Directors and above to advance 
Caesars Entertainment’s strategic DEI goals and education 
around themes of unconscious biases, microaggressions  and inclusivity in the workplace. Our goal is to have all  
Team Members (Supervisors and above) complete unconscious 
bias training by mid-2023. Alongside awareness, we are 
progressing towards achieving our targets through three  main strategies:
•
 At
tracting diverse external candidates: 
Extending searches to historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and other diverse schools and  eliminating bias from the hiring process by using inclusive  language in job postings and building diverse  candidate slates.
•
 Driving inclusion and r
etention:  
Conducting ongoing inclusion assessments among our Team Members through surveys, leveraging allyship through our Business Impact Groups (BIGs) and other executive-sponsored inclusion networks.
•
 Dev
eloping our Team Members:  
Advancing leadership development and succession planning for Team Members with DEI in mind, providing training, sponsorship and mentorship with a DEI focus and expanding inclusive human capital policies  and processes.To deliver on these strategies, we will continue to engage 
leading DEI experts who advise us on best-in-class practices. 
We will also continue to partner with DEI-focused organizations 
that can help us extend our reach in attracting diverse 
candidates and support inclusion, retention and development.  
A selection of organizations we regularly engage with to 
support diversity within our communities includes:
•100 Black Men of America
•Disability:IN•Diversity Best Practices•Global Gaming Women•Human Rights Campaign•League of United Latin American Citizens•
 National Association for th

we collaborated with 
the nonprofit OCA-Asian Pacific 
American Advocates on a mentorship 
program for our Team Members from the 
Asian American and Pacific Islander community. 
Eleven mentors from Caesars Entertainment 
volunteered to mentor Team Members 
in areas such as leadership,

CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT  
DEI SUMMIT 
We seek to encourage dialogue on DEI in our communities 
as part of our advocacy approach to raise awareness 
and promote good practices. Our platform, the Caesars 
Entertainment DEI Summit, created and hosted in unison by 
our CSR and Caesars Meetings teams, returned in early 2022 after an inaugural meeting in 20 1 9, bringing together our Team 
Members, corporate and nonprofit partners and suppliers in 
supporting and promoting efforts to advance DEI. We invited 
over 100 DEI thought leaders, champions and partners to the 
second Caesars Entertainment DEI Summit at Caesars Palace in 
Las Vegas to engage around the theme of “Activating the Next Era: Advancement of Inclusion and Advocacy.” 
From Caesars Entertainment, Heather Rapp, Senior Vice 
President, CSR, welcomed participants and Chief Executive 
Officer Tom Reeg introduced the day with perspectives on the 
value of DEI as a business imperative. The Summit included 
several thought-provoking sessions, keynotes and panel 
discussions led by notable DEI leaders and practitioners,  as well as a panel discussion involving diverse suppliers. The two task forces that were exploring the topics of  
measuring business impact and mental health inclusivity  
from the 20 1 9 summit presented their progress and insights. 
Participants confirmed that the Caesars Entertainment 2022  DEI Summit was unique and incredibly useful, convening on 
issues that are essential to understand and challenges that  
are critical to address.
ADVANCING BUSINESS  
IN A BIG WAY
Our Team Member Resource Groups, called Business  
Impact Groups (BIGs), bring self-identifying, diverse  
Team Members and their allies together to support each  
other and our communities through dimensions of DEI.  
BIGs’ goals address inclusive marketing, talent attraction  
and recruitment, professional development, supplier engagement and community service. Historically, our BIGs 
were launched in Las Vegas and developed nationally by 
adding chapters in our different regions. In 202 1, we created our seventh BIG, AVID, welcoming people with disabilities  and their allies (see more in Disability Inclusion). During the  
year, each BIG is active in advancing business efforts and 
engaging in partnerships internally, with suppliers and within  our communities in ways that offer opportunities and benefits  
to its membership, allies and networks. Through our BIGs, 
 we reach multiple communities, enhancing diversity in  
our organization and our culture of inclusion across all  our activities.Dialogue for DEI: In 202 1, Caesars continued to collaborate 
with internal BIGs and external DEI partners to host companywide 
town hall meetings several times throughout the year under the theme, “Conversations that Matter,” exploring different dimensions 
of DEI. Hundreds of Team Members participated in events covering topics such as mental health awareness, economic 
inclusion and social justice.

DISABILITY INCLUSION
We are serious about making Caesars Entertainment both 
accessible and welcoming for Team Members with disabilities 
and we continue to advance programs and initiatives to help 
realize this goal. As corporate partners of Disability:IN, the 
leading nonprofit resource for business disability inclusion 
worldwide and members of their Inclusion Works cohort,  we are committed to collaborating with other companies, 
learning and sharing to make Caesars Entertainment an 
employer and destination of choice for those with disabilities. 
In 202 1, Caesars Entertainment launched Awareness of Visible 
and Invisible Disabilities (AVID), a new BIG for Team Members across the Company’s 50+ properties to advance inclusion and equity for those with disabilities. AVID is a virtual forum where 
Team Members with disabilities, caregivers and their allies can 
work together to serve the disability community and create a work environment that is welcoming and accessible for all.  
To date, more than 675 Team Members have participated in AVID events, including a town hall meeting on mental health 
and a mental health workshop with Disability:IN. Caesars Entertainment is the first gaming company to be  
named “Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion” for the 
second consecutive year. In the 2022 Disability Equality Index, 
Caesars Entertainment received a top score of 100, improving 
its position from last year’s score of 80 (out of a possible 100). 
The Disability Equality Index is a joint initiative of the  American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD)  
and Disability:IN and represents the world’s most comprehensive benchmarking tool to measure disability 
workplace inclusion against competitors.
In 2022, Tom Reeg, Chief Executive Officer of Caesars 
Entertainment, joined more than 1 10 business leaders in signing 
the CEO Letter on Disability Inclusion. By signing the letter, 
CEOs commit to benchmarking their disability inclusion journey 
with the Disability Equality Index. Learn more.
“Caesars Entertainment is the first-ever gaming 
company honored as one of the Disability Equality 
Index’s “Best Places to Work for Disability 
Inclusion.”  In 2022, our second consecutive 
year on that list, we’re proud to have been 
awarded a perfect score. Our Team Members 
are the heart of our company.  We know 
it takes all of them for us to succeed. With that in 
mind, we are committed to making our company  
a diverse organization, honoring our differences 
and creating opportunities for every 
Team Member.”

SAFETY AND WELLNESS
We place the utmost importance on creating a safe and healthy 
workplace for our Team Members, embedding procedures and policies so our Team Members have the awareness, knowledge and tools to make working safely a habit and support to take care of their health. See our Position on Health & Safety .
SAFE WORKING
We are committed to the safety of our Team Members and comply with applicable laws and regulations concerning workplace safety. Every property maintains a safety committee focused on implementing safety procedures, risk analysis and frequent workplace inspections. Team Members complete annual safety training through our online platform (or in person) and additional training is provided as required to meet specific job requirements. We are focused on prevention and encourage Team Members to confidently speak up on  safety matters. 
In 202 1, our safety performance was less positive than in 2020, 
with an increase in Total Recordable Injury Rate from 2.6 1 per 100 Team Members to 3.06, representing an increase from 883 injuries to 1 , 1 7 4 in the same period. This is mainly attributed to high Team Member turnover in 2020 due to the COVID-1 9 pandemic. In 2022, we are introducing new safety monitoring and controls and reinforcing training and on-the-job safety observations and coaching with an aim to eliminate all injuries in our operations going forward. 
Targeted Safety Training
Each year, in addition to routine safety training, we conduct targeted training to raise awareness of specific safety risks and provide our Team Members with guidance on managing them effectively. For example, in 202 1, we placed a particular focus on oil spill prevention and tank management. Spill training and above-ground tank management are imperative for facilities with bulk oil storage to ensure the safety of Team Members and guests, as well as to protect the environment. This is especially true for many of our properties that border a body of water, such as a river, bay or ocean—the effects of even a minor oil spill on the municipal storm drain can be highly damaging to local wildlife and residents. Our oil spill prevention training was attended by representatives from every property in three sessions covering procedures for routine tank inspections, response required for tank spills and regulatory reporting requirements. The training emphasized the importance of proper handling, the health and safety of our Team Members in potentially dangerous situations and immediate strategies that can be implemented in the case of an emergency.
WELLNESS
We strive to provide our Team Members and their families with the opportunity and tools to help promote happy, healthy lives at work and at home. Caesars Entertainment has been an industry leader in curating a best-in-class benefits program to support our Team Members and their families. Our Health and Wellness program has accomplished both improved health metrics, as well as driven cost efficiencies for Team Members and our organization. In 2022, Caesars consolidated our group health plans and made significant enhancements to our wellbeing program to include a wide range of affordable options, mental health initiatives and expanded onsite and virtual clinics across the U.S. The two key platforms of our Health and Wellness program for Team Members from 2022 are the following:

This best-in-class offering gives eligible Team Members access to a variety of affordable healthcare plans, including choice in insurance carrier options for medical, dental and vision coverage. We harmonized benefit programs across our pre-merger legacy companies onto a single platform. Team Members now have multiple options to tailor available benefits to meet their needs while also enjoying flexibility in what they spend for coverage and healthcare for themselves and their families. Team Members enjoy full transparency around the value of their health coverage, enabling them to know exactly how much the Company contributes to their benefits in addition to their own personal contribution. With the Caesars Entertainment Health and Wellness Benefits program, Team Members can make informed decisions about their healthcare coverage and even earn discounts on additional programs such as home, car and pet insurance.

Wellbeing Program for Team Members
In addition to healthcare coverage, we also launched a new 
wellbeing program that encourages Team Members to be mindful of their whole health and invest in their own wellness  and resilience.
Path to Wellbeing addresses five pillars of wellbeing:Physical, Mental, Emotional, Interpersonal and FinancialOur wellbeing program incentivizes participation by offering  
a discount on medical premiums for completing certain  health screenings. On an ongoing basis, our Team Members have access to a wide range of options regarding how to maintain or improve their wellbeing across any of the five pillars of the program, whether these are health related, financial goal setting and education, mental wellbeing, social connectivity or other wellbeing-related activity. Participation in these programs is rewarded through a number of avenues. By the end of June 2022, more than 1 2,900 Team Members participated in our wellbeing program and started to enjoy a new phase in their health and wellbeing journey.
Helping Team Members in Need

IMPACT 
Social Equity & Education
Our aim is to help lift up our most vulnerable and underserved 
populations through educational programs, tools and platforms 
and facilitating equitable opportunities to participate in 
economic life. We engage widely with civil rights groups, 
business associations, national and local chambers of 
commerce and nonprofits to support inclusion of diverse 
individuals as guests, customers business partners and suppliers. 
Our programs typically include scholarship funding, diverse 
nonprofit partnerships such as 100 Black Men of America, 
UnidosUS and Disability:IN and our ongoing Economic Equity 
Tour (see below), as well as partnerships with cities to expand 
essential services to the most vulnerable. Our contributions  
to Boys & Girls Club of America (see below) and our “All-In  
On Education” program for Team Members (see section: Corporate Reinvestment) also support our social equity  
and education goals.
Climate Change & Food Security
We are committed to supporting global efforts to mitigate 
climate change and to advance food security, which is 
impacted by changing climate patterns. Our actions to support 
a cleaner, greener planet include work with nonprofits such as the National Park Trust and Clean the World. We have a 
longstanding relationship with Meals on Wheels America to aid 
in combating hunger and we donate food to local food banks.
Responsible Play & Mental Health
We invest in supporting responsible play through our 
engagement with and funding of Responsible Gaming awareness and assistance programs, including national and 
state Responsible Gambling organizations and academic and 
research institutions. We see a connection between responsible play and mental health and therefore invest in combating social 
isolation, addiction and loneliness through work with nonprofits 
that address these issues, such as Meals on Wheels America, 
Second Wind Dreams and others.SOCIAL CONTRIBUTION
In line with our Community Impact Framework, we continue 
to engage extensively with national business and community 
advocacy partners in several ways. Some examples include: 
Economic Equity Tour
This program, launched in 20 1 9, aims to provide opportunities 
and practical tools to advance small businesses in our communities, offering education, financial products and 
resources to help build business capacity. In 202 1, we partnered with the Women’s Business Enterprise Council 
(WBENC) to expand our reach to more small and diverse 
businesses across more cities and regions. In 202 1, the 
Economic Equity Tour delivered webinars for business and 
nonprofit participants, continuing with a virtual model to ensure 
everyone’s safety. Additionally, in 202 1, we funded a new 
training platform to help participants access tools and learn 
remotely at their own pace. As part of this program, more than 
800 people registered for business education webinars and  
we distributed 1,000 Microsoft e-Business licenses and almost 
300 Microsoft Nonprofit Technology Acceleration Packages at 
no charge to participants. Addressing Homelessness
Homelessness in the Las Vegas region has risen significantly 
since the COVID-1 9 pandemic, while resources available to 
address mental health, substance abuse programs and shelter 
have decreased. To further understand different aspects of homelessness and suggest future intervention opportunities, 
Caesars Entertainment partnered with the University of Nevada, 
Las Vegas (UNLV) to engage Masters students in academic 
research. The research outcomes are expected to inform 
decisions to help mitigate crime and improve the quality of life 
for the Las Vegas homeless population and residents and visitors 
to the city. We are the first gaming company to partner with the 
public sector to address such issues in the Las Vegas community.

Sponsoring Immigration Integration
For years, Caesars Entertainment has supported Team Members 
and their families in their journey to become American citizens. 
We believe this democratic process should be accessible to 
diverse individuals who can help enrich our society. In 202 1,  
Harrah’s Kansas City sponsored New American Welcome 
Week and hosted two back-to-back Naturalization 
Ceremonies, where 300 individuals from 55 countries  
became new citizens on Constitution Day. 
“Hosting the New American Welcome 
Week defines one of our core values, 
Together We Win.  Caesars 
Entertainment is welcoming of all 
backgrounds and experiences, knowing 
we are stronger together because 
of diversity.  Extending that welcome 
to our community members who took an

Caesars Entertainment partnered with Touro University by  
fully funding and hosting an event for CADD families,  
therapists, student volunteers and staff in celebration of  
Autism Awareness Month.ConveneNV 2022, Building on Our  
Sustainability Momentum 
We hosted this summit organized by ImpactNV at Bally’s 
Las Vegas Hotel & Casino. Senior Leaders from Caesars 
Entertainment spoke at the event, which drew more than  
200 delegates.
“ConveneNV 2022, ImpactNV’s annual 
sustainability summit and signature 
event, was our most successful 
ever.  The theme of “Building on Our 
Sustainability Momentum” was discussed 
by experts in three panels  through 
an economic, social and environmental 
sustainability lens for an audience of 
1 50 leaders from the Silver State.  
Caesars Entertainment is a longtime 
supporter of ImpactNV and the premier 
sponsor of our ConveneNV event. These 
important conversations don’t happen 
anywhere else and would not be possible 
without Caesars’ commitment to 
sustainability and investment   
in our state.”

CORPORATE REINVESTMENT
We believe in strategic philanthropy, that drives lasting change 
rather than simply plugs a gap. We work year after year with 
our signature nonprofit partnerships to achieve this through the 
Caesars Foundation and other corporate giving.
Caesars Foundation
Since its inception in 2002, Caesars Foundation has gifted  
more than $78 million to help older individuals live more 
fulfilling lives, promote a more sustainable world and support 
educational initiatives with several strategic partnerships, 
including Boys & Girls Clubs of America, Meals on Wheels 
America, National Park Trust and Clean the World. In addition 
to financial giving, thousands of Team Members engage with 
our strategic nonprofit partners through different volunteering 
events. Examples of our strategic partnership giving through  
Caesars Foundation in 202 1 include: 
Boys & Girls Club of America (BGCA): 
Caesars Foundation’s newest partner has a mission to enable 
 all young people, especially those who need us most, to reach 
their full potential as productive, caring, responsible citizens.  
Our funding will allow BGCA to develop Project Learn, a 
strategic, evidence-based approach to supporting academic success that can flexibly meet the complex needs of communities 
in our nation. Project Learn includes five components: homework 
help and tutoring, high yield learning activities (such as writing 
activities and games that develop cognitive skills), parent/caregiver engagement, school partnerships and incentives for 
positive academic participation.Meals on Wheels America (MOWA):  
Celebrating the 20th anniversary of our partnership with 
MOWA, the next phase of our funding will accelerate our 
collective impact and reinforce our partnership identity as changemakers in the socialization space. We expect to 
build transformational, lasting solutions for Meals on Wheels 
programs that need—more than ever before—a wide range  
of proven, measurable socialization interventions designed  
to meet clients’ diverse needs.
Clean the World:  
Clean the World Foundation Inc. is a global health leader 
committed to delivering WASH (water, sanitation and 
hygiene) programs to at-risk populations, both domestically 
and internationally. With our funding, the Clean the World 
Foundation will provide mental health support to the unhoused 
community and front-line workers delivering services, provide case management to the unhoused population and provide 
hygiene supplies to the vulnerable and underprivileged.  
Caesars Entertainment has partnered with Clean the World  
since 20 10 and recently invested in Mobile Hygiene Units  
that provide the unhoused in the Las Vegas community with  
an opportunity to shower.
National Park Trust:  
National Park Trust preserves parks today and creates  
park stewards for tomorrow. Its goal is to build on its long  
history of engaging outdoor education programs and  
distance learning programs. Caesars Entertainment’s funding 
provides a comprehensive Buddy Bison program in up to  
10 communities that reach 700 school students, including  
park trips. The Park Trust is empowering the next generation  
of park stewards by incorporating these elements into all  
its programs. Caesars Entertainment has been a National  
Park Trust partner since 20 10.

Community Reinvestment by Our Properties
In addition to the strategic funding provided by Caesars 
Foundation at the national level, all our properties engage with 
local communities to support programs with local relevance.  
A selection of giving activities in 202 1 included: 
Las Vegas Region: Donation of $100,000 to the  
Goodie Two Shoes Foundation, an organization that  
provides disadvantaged children with new shoes and socks. 
Our donation funded shoes and socks for more than  
10,000 children. The Las Vegas Region also donated more  
than $80,000 to the American Cancer Society with funds  
raised by hosting different events engaging Team Members, 
guests and community members. 
The ROW Reno: At the end of 202 1, The ROW piloted a new 
feature to engage casino guests in philanthropy. When guests 
at our casinos redeemed their slot cash-out tickets, they were 
prompted by our new ticket redemption program to choose 
whether to donate a portion of their cash payout. In the last 
three months of 202 1, guests donated more than $16,000 to 
local nonprofits. This new feature will continue at The ROW  
in 2022. We are evaluating the rollout of this option to  
all our casinos, subject to regulatory approvals.
Atlantic City Region: Our properties in Atlantic City 
supported donations to the New Jersey-based Cape-Atlantic 
Detachment of the Marine Corps League’s Toys for  
Tots campaign. Our Team Members hosted collection 
campaigns, generating more than 1 50 bicycles, hundreds  
of toys and a cash donation of $1 2,500. Overall, the campaign benefitted more than 3,700 disadvantaged children. 
Additionally, our Atlantic City teams provided gifts on various 
holidays throughout the year for more than 360 residents of 
Senior and Veteran Centers. They also organized a book drive, 
collecting 6 10 books for school-age children in Atlantic City to coincide with their first day at school in the Fall of 202 1.Southern California: Harrah’s Resort Southern California 
reinstated its unique All-In 4 Change charitable giving program 
in 202 1, after a break during the COVID-1 9 pandemic.  
The program engages guests and community members to  
vote for nonprofits to receive the property’s cash grants, raising 
awareness and driving appreciation for important local charitable organizations. In 202 1, more than 36,000 votes  
were cast, enabling 1 2 nonprofits to receive a portion of the 
total $100,000 awarded at a celebration event at Harrah’s 
Resort Southern California.
South Florida: Following another devastating earthquake  
in Haiti in 202 1, our Team Members at Harrah’s Pompano  
Beach rallied to collect supplies shipped to Haiti to help  
local victims. As a result of these efforts, the Association of  
the Past Pupils of The Dominique Savio College of Haiti 
conferred the “Humanitarian of the Year” award upon  
Harrah’s Pompano Beach.

Horse Racing Giving Back
With a long legacy of responsible horse racing destinations in Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania, Caesars Entertainment is committed 
to the growth and success of the horse racing industry. With unique partnerships with the horsemen and horsewomen at our racetracks, 
along with the breed organizations and regulatory bodies, we are committed to sustaining and further developing the racing industry  
as a thriving business that employs thousands of people across the states in which we operate.
*These figures include Isle Pompano Park’s 2021 racing impact, which ceased in April of 2022. Caesars Entertainment now operates four racetracks—Harrah’s 
Hoosier Park in Anderson, IN; Horseshoe Indianapolis in Shelbyville, IN; Harrah’s Philadelphia in Chester, PA; and Eldorado Gaming Scioto Downs in Columbus, 
OH. 2021 Charitable donations include corporate equine-related donations inclusive of a $400,000 2021 pledge payment to the Caesars Entertainment Equine 
Specialty Hospital through Purdue University. Figures are rounded to the nearest million.
Highlights among our multiple horse racing contributions  
in 202 1 include:
Empire of Hope: Developed with support from accredited 
racehorse aftercare organizations, Empire of Hope is a program 
designed to help raise awareness and funding for racehorses 
after their careers on the track are over. Funds generated from 
the program directly aid in the relocation, rehabilitation and 
repurposing of retired horses. Through a variety of promotions, 
donations and activities, Indiana racetracks Harrah’s Hoosier 
Park and Horseshoe Indianapolis have generated nearly 
$1 38,000 in funding since its inception in 20 1 9. Combined,  
the properties raised $34,000 in 202 1.

Jockeys and Jeans: Caesars Entertainment is the proud 
sponsor of Jockeys and Jeans, an organization that benefits 
the Permanently Disabled Jockey Fund (PDJF). The PDJF pays a 
monthly stipend to more than 60 former jockeys who suffered 
career-ending injuries, including many whose injuries left  
them paralyzed. As a presenting sponsor of Jockeys and Jeans, 
Caesars Entertainment contributed $50,000 along with an 
additional $6,865 from Horseshoe Indianapolis over 202 1  
and 2022. In March of 2022, Jockeys and Jeans named 
Caesars Entertainment’s SVP of Racing, Joseph Morris,  
an official Jockeys and Jeans Ambassador. In this role,  
Joseph Morris advocates for wounded jockeys’ financial 
support, make known the inherent dangers of racing and help  
in jockey recovery. With ongoing support of Morris and 
Caesars Entertainment, the PDJF has raised more than 
$689,000 at its marquee events over the last two years.  
In 2023, Caesars Entertainment will proudly host the Jockeys 
and Jeans fundraising event at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.
Caesars Entertainment Equine Specialty Hospital:  
In 202 1, we continued providing financial support to Purdue 
University’s state-of-the-art Equine Specialty Hospital 
in Shelbyville, Indiana. The equine hospital is a premier 
performance horse veterinary hospital providing specialty referral, medical and surgical services while supporting equine research and education. We also collaborate closely with the 
hospital in a variety of ways. Currently, we are working with 
the Indiana Horse Racing Commission to establish a veterinary 
development program to support interns receiving training at 
the racetracks and providing hands-on experience for young 
veterinarians to help address the shortage of medical treatment 
for large animals.“The horse racing industry is a close-knit and caring community;  
we love horses, we admire our horsemen and horsewomen and there is nothing 
that can top the fun and excitement of the track on racing day.   
But it’s much more than fun; we all feel a great responsibility to give  
our equine athletes their best life , before, during and after their active 
racing years and to support our human athletes who may be injured during racing. 
Our commitment will always be to Go All-In.”

with local commerce, minority, women-owned, disadvantaged, 
disabled, veteran and LGBTQ-owned and certified businesses 
(MWDBEs). Additionally, we support the diverse Chambers 
of Commerce and many other organizations that promote 
these businesses. A selection of organizations we regularly 
engage with to support diversity within our supply chain and our 
communities includes:
•Disability:IN
•National Association of Minority Contractors•
 National Center for American Indian 
 
 
Enterprise Development
•National LGBT Chamber of Commerce•National Minority Supplier Development Council •National Veteran-Owned Business Association•U.S. Black Chambers, Incorporated•U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce•U.S. Pan Asian American Chamber of Commerce•Women’s Business Enterprise CouncilFor years we have invested in mentoring programs for diverse 
suppliers, helping them gain diversity certifications, commence or 
expand business with Caesars Entertainment and increase their 
capacity to compete. We take the opportunity to engage with diverse suppliers and consider their needs, for example, with a 
panel of diverse suppliers at the Caesars Entertainment DEI Summit 
(see section above). All of this is key to our strategy of increasing 
economic inclusion in every market in which we operate.
In 202 1, we intensified efforts to increase spending with our 
current diverse supply base, recognizing the challenges diverse 
suppliers have faced through the COVID-1 9 pandemic and 
ongoing economic climate. We spent $33 million, or 55%  
more with diverse MWDBE suppliers in 202 1 compared  
to 2020. Of those suppliers, 76% benefited from an increase  
in spending of 50% more year over year.
In 202 1, our operational and capital spend* with 
certified diverse vendors totaled 9.5% and 6%, 
respectively, of total addressable spend.
*Addressable spend does not include taxes, utilities and some highly regulated 
gaming trade sectors defined as addressable.

Climate action failure is the world’s most significant 
environmental risk, according to the World Economic Forum’s 
Global Risks Report 2022.  Through consistent and collective 
efforts, we will be able to preserve the planet for future 
generations. At Caesars Entertainment, in line with global efforts, 
we have always taken a precautionary approach, choosing 
to take action to reduce our environmental impacts across 
the entire scope of our operations and supply chain, leading 
our industry in many aspects of energy reductions, emissions avoidance and resource efficiency. We were among the first 
in our industry to commit to Science Based Targets, using 20 1 1 
as our base year. See our Position on Climate Change.
Caesars Entertainment achieved a B score in CDP’s 
Climate Change 202 1 questionnaire.
TARGETS AND PATHWAY
Currently, our Science Based Targets commit us to reducing 
100% of our 20 1 1 emissions by 2050 to meet scientific 
guidelines needed to achieve global warming levels that  
are “Well Below 2 degrees.” We are reviewing these targets  
to meet updated Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) 
guidelines to align with a threshold of “Below 1.5 degrees,” 
which the scientific community now believes must be achieved 
to avoid catastrophic climate change. We plan to submit our 
proposal for our more ambitious climate targets to SBTi in 2023. 
In the meantime, we are trending towards our interim 2025 
target ahead of time and have plans to deliver our 2050 target.
Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Approved Targets Performance in 2021
Scope 1+2: Reduce absolute Scope 1+2 emissions by 35% by 2025  
and by 100% by 2050 from a 20 1 1 base-year. -33.9%

RENEWABLE ENERGY 
We are integrating renewable energy as part of our total 
electricity consumption through Purchase Power Agreements 
that provided 6% of our companywide electricity use in 202 1. 
We are also expanding our on-site solar power generation. In 
addition to solar arrays at two tribal partner properties, Harrah’s 
Cherokee Valley River and Harrah’s Resort Southern California, 
we added four additional solar-covered parking projects in 
202 1-2022. Harrah’s Pompano Beach installed a 500kW 
capacity array in 202 1 and in early 2022, our partner broke 
ground on three solar-covered parking projects in Atlantic City 
that we will host. These projects include five solar canopies 
at Caesars Atlantic City, Harrah’s Resort Atlantic City and 
Tropicana Atlantic City, with almost 7 .5MW capacity in total 
and an additional 9 1 3kW rooftop system at Harrah’s Resort 
Atlantic City. 
In addition to generating approximately 10,000MWh of clean, 
renewable energy annually—enough energy to power 93 1 
homes each year—the canopies will provide shaded parking 
for guests and Team Members. At the same time, the rooftop 
system limits UV exposure to the roof, helping extend its lifespan 
and reduce cooling needs. We continue to evaluate on-site 
and utility-scale solar opportunities and expect to progress  
new initiatives in Colorado, Illinois, Maryland and Nevada  
in 2022-2023.
Our Atlantic City solar initiative is expected 
to avoid more than 8,000 metric tons of CO2 
emissions annually.“Caesars Entertainment’s Atlantic City 
resorts are committed to being leaders  
in environmental sustainability. We are working 
toward reducing our environmental footprint and 
creating more clean energy in the market.”

ENERGY EFFICIENCIES
As in previous years, we have maintained a rigorous  
approach to improving our energy and emissions footprint.
A New Standard for Building Energy 
Management Systems (BEMS)  
Continuing our extensive energy efficiency programs at  
our facilities, in 202 1, we approved $ 10 million in initiatives 
to upgrade energy management systems at several of our 
properties to deliver better efficiency and greater comfort  
for our Team Members and guests. These BEMS initiatives  
cover more than 10 properties across the U.S., several of  
which had been running aging energy management systems 
that were in need of replacement. Given the scale of these 
projects and the expected need for similar upgrades in the 
coming years, we created a new technical standard for  
BEMS for all Caesars Entertainment facilities. Elements of  
the new standard address all forms of HVAC systems, 
temperature controls with independent control valve  
scheduling, thermal mapping of general areas to prevent 
inefficient heating and cooling, lighting efficiencies and IT 
controls to prevent disruptions due to information systems  
failures or breaches. By establishing new BEMS protocols  
and standards, we will be able to identify improvement opportunities more readily and head toward a path of compatibility across properties.
Energy Efficiency Solutions 
Additional examples of energy efficiency initiatives at our 
properties in 202 1 include: 
•
 A
t Harrah’s Hoosier Park, Horseshoe Indianapolis and 
Horseshoe Hammond in Indiana, we replaced 23 energy recovery wheels. Hoosier Park and Horseshoe Indianapolis properties were experiencing high humidity levels in the buildings. Addressing the root cause of the issue—aging energy units that had been underperforming despite ongoing maintenance—we replaced all units, delivering significant energy savings for the three properties. 
•
 A
t Harrah’s Las Vegas, an air handling unit (AHU) that 
provided air circulation at the casino entry failed.  Rather than simply replace the AHU, we are installing a different type of lightweight AHU on the roof of the facility and adding new air pressure controls in the building to ensure optimal air circulation. This solution  will yield ongoing energy savings as well as enhance guest and Team Member comfort at the property. 
•
 T
he ROW Reno installed 1 80 variable frequency drive 
(VFD) motors across the property’s boilers, cooling towers, pumps and AHUs. VFDs vary the frequency and voltage of the power supply, as well as enabling fast startup and shutdown of power motors, meaning the property can avoid leaving power motors running 24/7 by operating the VFD to meet actual power needs. This delivered a significant reduction in energy consumption for the property. 
•
 A
t several properties, we continued our ongoing 
conversion of lighting fixtures to energy-efficient options. At the Grand Ballroom at Paris Las Vegas Hotel & Casino, for example, 354 obsolete halogen fixtures were replaced with 708 digitally controlled LED luminaires. The new system is a first of its kind in Las Vegas. It provides convention goers with bright white light for expos, warm candlelight for dinner receptions and hundreds of colored light options to match any request from a corporate brand standard to a wedding reception—all while reducing energy consumption. Annually, this upgrade alone saves more than 2.5 million kWh. In 202 1, we replaced more than 1 3,000  
fluorescent or halogen lamps with advanced  
LED technology, yielding an annualized energy 
saving of more than 4.2 million kWh.
Cumulative emissions avoided through LED 
lighting installations at our properties since 20 10 
exceed an estimated 42,000 metric tons of CO2, 
equivalent to powering more than 8,000 homes 
with electricity for one year.“Our BEMS standard  is an 
entirely new way of approaching 
building maintenance at the enterprise 
level. Rather than address each issue 
individually, we can now evaluate 
and manage all properties  against 
a defined set of metrics. This makes it 
easier to assess whether facilities perform 
optimally against benchmarks and  
be smarter about maintenance 
solutions.  It’s about future-proofing 
our facilities,  rather than just replacing 
pieces of equipment.”

Energy Savings Using Reclaimed Water  
Our centralized Las Vegas Laundry is one of the largest 
private laundry facilities in the country, laundering bed sheets, 
bathroom towels, tablecloths, pool towels, cloth napkins and 
Team Member uniforms for the region. We are always seeking 
to improve the operation’s efficiency. In 202 1, we delivered 
an estimated 7-8% saving on natural gas consumption using 
reclaimed water to preheat the water supply to the laundry. 
The reclaimed water is sourced from the laundry wastewater 
treatment process, which uses heating to eliminate  
laundry chemicals. 
“With a water supply to the laundry of 
more than 6 million gallons per 
year,  avoiding the need to heat up 
to 20% of incoming water by using 
reclaimed water through a change in 
our process offers a significant 
benefit for energy use.  It’s just 
one example of continually working to 
improve our internal process and  
help our planet.”
Jeff Seavey
Vice President
Enterprise Facilities & OperationsGREEN CONSTRUCTION
We aim to design and construct all new properties and 
renovations in line with green building principles, notably 
the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and 
Environmental Design (LEED) standards. One of our most recent 
new buildings on the Las Vegas Strip, CAESARS FORUM, 
our flagship 550,000-square-foot conference center, was 
awarded LEED silver certification. 
Reimagining Caesars Palace HQ
In 2022, we completed the second and final phase of  
our remodeling of Las Vegas Corporate Headquarters at  
Caesars Palace. This effort began in 202 1 and combined three 
office buildings into one new corporate headquarters spanning 
more than 1 48,000 square feet. The redesign was based on 
LEED standards and included several energy and water-saving 
elements, low-waste solutions and optimal working spaces for 
Team Members’ health and comfort. For example:
•
 Maximum use of natur
al daylight by using the windowed 
corridor as circulation space instead of private office use, as well as energy-efficient, LED lighting throughout the offices
•
 C
omplete overhaul of air ventilation and HVAC systems 
to upgrade air quality and provide individual office controls for greater comfort and improved hygiene

MITIGATING CLIMATE CHANGE  
IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN
We continue to promote carbon efficiencies and climate 
consciousness throughout our supply chain. In 202 1, we again 
invited our top suppliers (by spend) to submit their climate  
data to the CDP Climate Change through the CDP Supply 
Chain program. We are committed to helping educate our 
suppliers and encourage them to disclose and improve their 
carbon performance. We engage with suppliers to offer 
assistance from our team or CDP representatives.
Many of our suppliers receive requests for carbon disclosure 
solely from Caesars Entertainment, indicating the important 
role we play in raising awareness and driving climate-positive performance in our industry. For example, in 202 1, 42% of the 
suppliers we invited to participate in CDP were not requested  
to do so by any other of their customers. 
Electric Vehicle Charging 
In addition to our carbon reduction targets, we help our  
guests live a low-carbon lifestyle. For years, we have 
maintained Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations at our properties for free use by guests who choose cleaner forms of 
transportation. We have more than 1 50 EV charging ports at 
multiple locations across the U.S and host a Tesla Supercharger 
station and energy center at The LINQ Promenade in Las Vegas, 
offering 39 charging stations as well as at The ROW in Reno. 
We plan to expand our EV charging capacity across North 
America through a provider who can support EV charging ports 
at all our properties. We expect to finalize our strategy and 
begin deployment in 2022, starting with our largest resorts in  
Las Vegas, Reno and Atlantic City.Since opening in 20 19, our Las Vegas Tesla 
Supercharger station has supported more 
than 80,000 charging sessions, resulting in the 
avoidance of an estimated 3,000 metric tons  
of CO2 through the end of June 202 1 .¹

WATER  
We aim to use water responsibly by using water-efficient 
fixtures, implementing robust maintenance programs that identify 
and prevent leaks and engaging Team Members and guests. 
We encourage guests to conserve water through room signage 
that suggests limiting daily towel and bedsheet replacement. 
We anticipate future water dependency to decrease in our 
direct operations as we continue to implement conservation and 
efficiency projects, including the use of reclamation technology. 
See our Position on Water .
Caesars Entertainment named to CDP’s  
202 1 A-list for Water Security.
We estimate that less than 1 5% of our water usage is consumed 
by customers or used for irrigation. Most of our water is  
used on-site either as process water or by our guests and  
Team Members and returned directly to the sewer system.
In 202 1, our water consumption decreased  
by 1 5% per square foot compared to 20 19. *
*Water consumption was lower in 2020 due to property closures during the 
pandemic, so the comparison to 2020 is not meaningful.
In 2022, we committed to a new target to reduce 
water consumption by 20% per square foot by 
2035 using a 20 19 baseline. We plan to achieve this target through a mixture of measures to 
improve evaporative cooling efficiency, new leak management 
procedures, drip irrigation and smart watering controls for 
landscape and garden areas, low flow fixtures across all 
properties and more. 
Addressing Water Consumption 
Caesars Entertainment operates nine properties in  Southern Nevada. Southern Nevada is a highly water-stressed 
region that relies on water from the Colorado River via the reservoir of Lake Mead. Given the prolonged drought in the 
western U.S. and very low water levels in Lake Mead, water 
conservation is critically important to our communities in Nevada and our properties. All the water used at our properties is 
sourced from the Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA), 
which recycles 99% of indoor used water back into Lake Mead, yielding one of the lowest per capita consumptive water use 
rates in the country despite the population growth and high 
tourism levels in Las Vegas. Our properties use low-flow water 
fixtures such as shower heads and faucet aerators. We have 
replaced much of our ornamental turf with native, drought-
tolerant landscaping. We engage with the SNWA to help 
educate our Team Members on how they can further conserve 
water at our properties. Additionally, we are hosting SNWA 
conservation outreach teams at all our Las Vegas properties  
to speak directly to Team Members about conserving  
water at home.

WASTE  
Across all our properties, we aim to minimize the waste we 
generate within our daily operations through careful planning and 
inventory management, reuse and repurposing of materials and, in the case of food waste and prudent meal preparation and 
portion management. Waste we cannot avoid is segregated at 
our properties and routed for recycling as far as possible. At our 
Las Vegas properties, all waste is sorted at our loading docks, 
alleviating any confusion on what’s recyclable for our guests  
and Team Members. See our Position on General & Food Waste.
In 202 1, 40% of our total waste generated was 
diverted from landfills.
Recycled waste consists mainly of paper products, plastics, 
glass and unconsumed organics. The majority of our waste 
is discarded by guests who stay or play at our properties. 
Construction waste is generated through building and 
renovation activities, with surplus furniture and equipment  
from such activities usually being donated. Similarly, surplus food from our dining and banqueting facilities are donated 
to local food banks or shelters and excess materials from 
conferences and meetings are usually donated to the local community partners.In 2022, we committed to a new target to divert 
from landfills 65% of all waste generated at our 
properties by 2030.
We will achieve the diversion of unavoidable waste in a variety 
of ways by 2030. These include continuously identifying new 
recycling opportunities; working with our suppliers to reduce packaging and shipping material waste; implementing food waste programs consistently across all properties; converting to bulk 
dispensers instead of personal room amenities and recycling soap at all properties through the social enterprise Clean the World. 
Addressing Food Waste in Las Vegas: In Las Vegas, we 
engage our Stewarding and Kitchen teams to divert food waste to a 
local composting facility. Team Members in banquet and restaurant 
kitchens and dish rooms are trained to scrape plates and toss 
preparation scraps into green bins which are then transported to an 
industrial compost facility and animal farm. Our nine properties divert 
over 1,000 tons of organic waste from landfills on an annual basis.
Following the second phase of our Las Vegas Corporate Headquarters remodel in 2022 (see section: Green 
Construction), items we could not repurpose for use at other 
properties were donated to five local nonprofits. Similar items 
were also donated at the end of the first phase in 202 1 .

Reducing Waste with Shania Twain
In 202 1, the Zappos Theater team, in partnership with Shania 
Twain and co-promoter Live Nation, worked on several initiatives 
to raise awareness, eliminate waste and increase upstream 
recycling. At Zappos Theater, like all our Las Vegas properties, 
all waste is sorted downstream at the dock. However, there’s 
opportunity to increase diversion rates further by encouraging 
recycling. Key initiatives included:
•
 Elimination of St
yrofoam cups in favor of recyclable 
cardboard cups at the venue 
•
 R
eplacement of water bottles with reusable stainless steel 
water jug dispensers at all backstage locations for Team Members and the artist and cast 
•
 Installation of recycling garbage cans with recycling logos in pr
ominent backstage locations to encourage 
artists and crew to sort and recycle their waste, facilitating downstream sorting at our docks
“Our initiatives  to reduce waste and 
encourage active participation  
in recycling started new conversations 
about our environmental impact at 
Zappos Theater. Through this innovative 
collaboration with the Shania Twain 
residency, we have set new standards for 
doing our part to save the planet for 
all future residencies and shows.”
Nathaniel Mondell
Director of Operations
Planet Hollywood/Zappos TheaterLaundry
Our Las Vegas Laundry operation diverted 630,000 pounds  
of laundry waste from landfills in 202 1. This included:
•
 280,000 lbs. of towels and pillowcases, wh

EXTRAORDINARY  
GUEST EXPERIENCES 
Our objective is to provide all guests, visitors and digital 
users with a positive and unmatched experience across our 
properties, venues and online platforms. We aim for more than 
satisfaction; we want our guests to experience the Extraordinary. 
We continuously challenge ourselves to drive innovation in our 
offerings, offer unbeatable rewards for guest loyalty and serve our guests with passion and excellence. See our Position on 
Guest Experience.
Guests choose Caesars Entertainment: In 202 1,  
Caesars Rewards was recognized as the best customer loyalty 
program in the gaming industry in every major award: Freddie 
Awards, Global Gaming Awards and USA Today—the first time 
that Caesars Entertainment has been honored by all three in the same year. Selected by panels of experts and public votes, these awards demonstrate that our guests, customers and industry 
experts are choosing Caesars Entertainment over other offerings 
in the industry. With over 65 million members, Caesars Rewards  
is the largest loyalty program in the gaming industry.“Our guests have always been  
at the center  of what we do at  
Caesars Entertainment and Caesars 
Rewards helps our incredible Team 
Members make that possible. Through 
Caesars Rewards, we’re able to link 
more than 50 destinations  
across the country, each with incredible 
experiences and amenities, with each 
other and a suite of mobile sports betting 
and iGaming products. That means our 
members can earn and redeem 
rewards  wherever and whenever they 
want to play.”
Josh Jones
Chief Marketing Officer
Personal service with Ivy: Our digital concierge, IvyTM,  
uses advanced artificial intelligence and SMS technology  
to continue to delight guests with a rapid, convenient  
and highly responsive service that make interactions with  
Caesars Entertainment easy, seamless and fun. Ivy is now deployed in 27 properties across 
35,000 rooms, providing concierge services in any 
preferred language including property information, 
housekeeping requests, entertainment tickets and 
dining reservations, ordering meals and more.
As we continue to roll out Ivy across more properties, we are 
expanding its capabilities and offerings. For example, we 
recently added Ivy opt-in to Caesars.com so guests can start 
communicating with Ivy as soon as they book their stay. This enables 
us to help guests plan their visit and set guests up for a great arrival 
experience by providing check-in and parking instructions.  
New special features are also being added at different properties. 
For example, guests at our Lake Tahoe properties can text a special 
Ivy Tahoe Spa Line to book appointments, obtain spa information 
and communicate with the spa team instead of having to call. 
Guests at our Cherokee properties can receive digital event tickets 
via Ivy to save visiting the box office in person. Additionally, our 
Caesars Eats mobile food and beverage ordering promoted 
through Ivy is now offered at 35 properties across the country, 
enabling guests to order food from outlets on property for pick up or delivery to their room, pool, Sportsbook, bars or lounges.
“Guests continue to rave about 
Ivy and how convenient it is  to 
be able to text with the hotel instead of 
calling down from the room phone. In 
fact, Ivy even received a handwritten 
thank you note from a guest at one of our 
Tahoe properties. Overall, Ivy is making 
the Caesars Entertainment experience 
easy and fun for guests  and 
enables us to respond effectively  
to their needs.”

EXTRAORDINARY  
GUEST EXPERIENCES 
At Harrah’s Gulf Coast and Harrah’s New Orleans, in 202 1,  
we leveraged the Ivy platform to manage guest communications 
in a challenging situation. Hurricane Ida severely impacted the 
Gulf Coast region, requiring us to close Harrah’s Gulf Coast 
and Harrah’s New Orleans to protect our guests and  
Team Members. In such situations, ensuring guests are  
informed about weather events that affect their stay with us 
is critical. In addition to using the typical email and voicemail 
messages, we were able to use Ivy, our text messaging platform, 
to provide the most up-to-date information regarding the storm 
status, property closure, evacuation procedures, transportation 
and cancellation arrangements. Despite the circumstances of 
Hurricane Ida being beyond our control, guests appreciated 
up-to-the-minute information, enabling them to stay safe as they 
considered their travel options.
DESTINATIONS & OFFERINGS
We are constantly investing in more and better ways to PLAY 
at Caesars Entertainment. Each year, we expand our range of 
hospitality, dining, gaming and entertainment options to offer 
the most diverse choices to guests who seek to experience the Extraordinary. Many of our investments in new properties 
and renovations (see below) span two or more years. In 
the past year, we rebranded several properties under the 
Horseshoe and Harrah’s names so that our guests can more 
easily recognize and enjoy the properties that offer the Caesars 
Entertainment and Caesars Rewards experience.
Throughout 202 1 and into 2022, we continue to provide new 
and expanded offerings to our guests while bringing new 
life to local economies through job creation in design and

DESTINATIONS  
AND OFFERINGS 
In addition to our investment in expansion and renovations, 
we continue to assure the proper functioning of facilities at our 
properties through a robust ongoing preventive maintenance 
program. In 202 1, we spent more than $1 30 million on maintenance programs to ensure our properties run as planned.
Live Entertainment: Caesars Entertainment continues to  
be a leader in live entertainment with more than 7 ,000 live shows 
in 202 1, after forced restrictions in 2020 and part of 202 1 due  
to the pandemic. We bring the best headliners and residencies to 
Las Vegas and other regions, offering extraordinary entertainment 
for guests who travel from afar to experience the best artists in  
a live setting. In 202 1, we partnered with Spiegelworld, the  
Las Vegas-based entertainment promoter, collectively investing 
nearly $75 million to create three all-new live entertainment 
experiences at Caesars Entertainment resorts in Las Vegas,  
Atlantic City and New Orleans.
CAESARS DIGITAL
In recent years, our expansion into digital gaming and sports 
betting has provided many new offerings for customers 
nationwide. As this industry continues to grow rapidly, we’ve made significant investment in resources and continue to 
expand our online offerings by leveraging our longstanding 
gaming expertise and experience. We offer digital gaming 
opportunities in more than 25 jurisdictions today and  continue to pursue opportunities in additional states as  they approach legalization. Caesars Rewards is fully integrated 
into our digital products and our customers benefit from the full 
range of Caesars Entertainment’s offerings across digital and 
brick-and-mortar venues. Following our acquisition of William 
Hill in 202 1, we combined our technology platforms for online 
gaming, converting our entire Caesars Digital brand to the most 
advanced platform for the best possible customer experience.  
Similar to our brick-and-mortar casinos, we maintain a full 
Responsible Gaming program for digital gaming that integrates 
player information across our platforms so that a player who 
self-excluded in-person will also be self-excluded online.  
The Caesars Sportsbook app has best-in-class tools in place  
to prevent problem gambling, including Deposit Limits, 
Spending Limits, Daily Time Limits and Cool Off Time Periods.“We’re tremendously proud  of our 
Caesars Sportsbook and Caesars Casino 
online apps. Each of them brings Caesars 
Rewards to life in an entirely new way. 
Just as we approach any new brick-and-
mortar development carefully considering 
the needs and desires of our potential 
guests, our growth in online 
gaming  also requires a vision unique 
to each new jurisdiction. As new states 
open up, it’s not simply a copy and paste 
execution. We work to understand 
each market individually,  tailoring 
the experience to ensure that every 
interaction leaves our guests feeling 
like a Caesar.”

DESTINATIONS  
AND OFFERINGS 
Caesars Sportsbook: In August 202 1, our new sports 
betting offering Caesars Sportsbook officially launched through a 
multimillion-dollar rebranding campaign. The campaign, headlined 
by actor-comedian JB Smoove, also included an historic,  
first-ever Responsible Gaming ad spot to air during NFL games and 
alongside the Super Bowl (see our Position on Responsible Gaming). 
Throughout the past year, we created several new partnerships to 
become the official sports betting partner of the most prominent and 
iconic sports teams and organizations in the country as additional 
states have legalized, to engage new audiences of sports fans. As 
the first-ever Official Casino Partner in the history of the NFL and an 
Official Sports Betting Partner, we further deepened our relationship 
in many areas, including hosting the three-day 2022 NFL Draft in 
Las Vegas attended by more than 200,000 sports enthusiasts and 
fans tuning in across the world.
Caesars Superdome: Caesars Entertainment is the naming 
rights partner for the Caesars Superdome, home of the NFL’s 
New Orleans Saints. The Caesars Superdome is an acclaimed 
destination and plays host to the nation’s most important 
major sporting events, such as the Super Bowl and the NCAA 
Basketball’s Final Four. Located in the heart of New Orleans—in 
close proximity to a popular Caesars Entertainment destination, 
Harrah’s New Orleans—Caesars Superdome serves as an 
extension of our company’s legacy of hospitality, gaming and 
sports in this iconic city, boosting tourism and helping to secure 
a prosperous future for the city. 
Caesars Racebook: In early 2022, we launched a  
new horse racing wagering app, Caesars Racebook, in 
partnership with NYRA Bets, the official advance deposit 
wagering platform of the New York Racing Association, Inc. 
(NYRA). Caesars Racebook complements our legacy in horse 
racing offerings and provides a platform for wagering on marquee horse racing events in the United States, including at 
Caesars-operated tracks: Harrah’s Hoosier Park, Horseshoe 
Indianapolis, Harrah’s Philadelphia and Eldorado Gaming 
Scioto Downs and at international tracks around the world.

53MEETINGS  
AND EVENTS 
For meetings and events, Caesars Entertainment offers more 
than 2. 1 million square feet of conference space and more 
than 50 properties across the country. We have seen a strong 
return to in-person meetings following the pandemic. Bookings 
through 2024 are solid and are surpassing 20 1 9 levels.
CAESARS FORUM, our newest 550,000-square-foot 
conference center in the heart of Las Vegas, saw its first  
full year of business starting June 202 1. Customer feedback 
has been tremendous. The biophilic design and the 
100,000-square-foot Plaza have been a big draw in  
addition to the two largest pillarless ballrooms in the world.
Extraordinary events: During the past year, our teams have 
supported thousands of events, including Meeting Professionals 
International World Education Congress 202 1 (MPI WEC), 
the Professional Convention Management Association 2022 
(PCMA), Cvent CONNECT and the incredible three-day 2022 
NFL Draft in Las Vegas (see section: Caesars Digital).
Family-Style Service: Caesars Entertainment is committed 
to delivering exemplary personalized service. We provide a 
one-stop-shop approach for planners to help them execute 
flawless meetings and exceed expectations. Earlier this 
year, the sales team embarked on the Caesars Entertainment 
Remastered Tour. The Tour is a series of fun events across the 
nation, designed exclusively for planners to refamiliarize with 
Caesars Entertainment. These gatherings provide an opportunity 
to reconnect with our customers and better understand their expectations as the meetings business moves back into 
normalcy. In addition, Caesars Entertainment is focused on 
the wellbeing of attendees and has sponsored Wellbeing 
Challenges at many conferences and events. 
 Supporting the hospitality industry: The Caesars 
Entertainment Meetings and Events team is committed to 
the hospitality industry and many of our sales leaders hold leadership board or committee roles with organizations such 
as the PCMA, Meetings Professionals International (MPI) and 
the Society for Incentive Travel Excellence (SITE) at national 
and regional levels. Our initiatives with these organizations 
include funding scholarships for meeting professionals 
supporting programs advancing diversity, equity and inclusion, 
collaborating to eliminate human trafficking and promoting environmental sustainability programs. 
“As a Board Member  of SITE Texas 
and my deep involvement in the industry 
with other organizations such as MPI, I 
try to be an active voice in helping 
the hospitality industry grow  in 
a responsible and sustainable manner. I 
believe the meetings and events industry 
has a role in driving sustainability 
and in helping local communities  
through donation of surplus food and 
equipment from events. I personally 
participate in these environmental 
and social initiatives,  along with 
many of my colleagues.”

RESPONSIBLE  
GAMING 
For more than 30 years, Caesars Entertainment has maintained 
an industry-leading Responsible Gaming (RG) program using 
an integrated approach built on clear objectives, measurable outcomes and scientific research. Caesars wants everyone who 
gambles to do so for the right reason—to simply have fun.  
We train tens of thousands of Team Members each year and  
a cadre of RG Ambassadors throughout our properties to 
identify guests who may be in need of problem gambling 
assistance and support. We are regular contributors to national and state council and community RG programs that help advance responsible practices in the gaming industry.  
See our Position on Responsible Gaming.
Caesars Sportsbook advancing RG: With the launch of 
Caesars Sportsbook, Caesars Entertainment created a wide-
ranging partnership with football’s legendary Manning family. 
On behalf of the continued partnership, the Mannings agreed 
to spread the word about Responsible Gaming and did so  
by appearing in a national television campaign dedicated  
to RG and providing visibility to the National Council on 
Problem Gambling’s national problem gambling helpline.  
The ad was clear, direct and encouraged customers to have  
a game plan, set a limit for their gambling activity and use the 
RG tools available on the Caesars Sportsbook app. The spot 
made history as the first Responsible Gaming ad to air during 
NFL Games. The ad aired on Sundays during weeks 16- 1 8  
of the regular season, through the NFL playoffs, around  
Super Bowl LVI and leading up to the NFL Draft in April 2022. Our investment in this RG campaign was several million dollars 
over 5 months of airtime starting in December 202 1 and it 
garnered 89 million impressions. 
 RG Training for our Team Members: Nearly 20 years 
ago, Caesars Entertainment developed research-backed 
RG training for Team Members. Our pioneering Responsible 
Gaming Ambassador (RGA) program provides advanced 
training to Team Members who discuss Responsible Gaming 
concerns with customers. This year, we have worked to extend 
the RG infrastructure seamlessly across our digital platforms, 
including Caesars Sportsbook. Select Caesars Sportsbook 
Team Members are being trained as RGAs, joining more  
than 1,500 of their peers across our brick-and-mortar  
gaming facilities. 
In 202 1, nearly 42,000 Team Members 
participated in dedicated Responsible Gaming 
training, totaling over 3 1 ,000 hours.
“Online or in-person, it’s our responsibility to create an environment 
that encourages and promotes Responsible Gaming.  
In keeping with Caesars Entertainment’s legacy as a pioneer 
in Responsible Gaming, in our first football season, Caesars 
Sportsbook partnered with the Manning family to create a television 
spot dedicated to responsible play.  Demonstrating our 
commitment, we became the first sportsbook operator to 
air a Responsible Gaming commercial  during nationally 
televised NFL games.”

RESPONSIBLE  
GAMING 
Supporting RG in our industry: Caesars Entertainment 
has continuously partnered with organizations and research 
institutions that advance RG practices and programs.  
For example, we are an original supporter of the  
International Center for Responsible Gaming (ICRG).  
In 2022, the Caesars Foundation committed $200,000  
to ICRG during Problem Gambling Awareness Month to  
further RG education and research programs. Since 1 996, 
Caesars Entertainment has donated more than $6 million to 
support the ICRG in providing independent, peer-reviewed 
research that helps increase the understanding of  
gambling disorders.
“Caesars has supported ICRG 
from day one  and has literally helped 
create the field of study on gambling 
addiction and responsible gambling. 
We are deeply grateful for their 
continuing support  of efforts  
to effectively prevent and treat  
gambling disorder.”
Arthur Paikowsky
President, International Center
for Responsible GamingIn 202 1, Caesars Entertainment developed the LSU Responsible 
Gaming Alliance as part of the company’s sponsorship of  
LSU Athletics. Caesars is working with the university, state 
officials and the state problem gambling council with a  
goal to prevent and reduce the incidence and impact  
of gambling disorders within the LSU community. 
“Our goal is simple: We want 
everyone who plays with us, online 
or in person, to do so for the right 
reasons—to simply have fun. As the 
largest gaming company in 
North America,  we have a special 
responsibility to ensure that everything 
we do is built on a foundation  
of Responsible Gaming.   
From supporting statewide councils 
on problem gambling and funding the 
ICRG to creating training developed 
through independent academic research, 
Caesars Entertainment fosters 
collaboration  across a wide range  
of networks to ensure we deliver the  
latest educational information and 
practical resources to our guests and Team Members.”

ETHICAL CONDUCT  
AND COMPLIANCE 
Caesars Entertainment strives to conduct its business ethically 
and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. 
Our Code of Commitment, first made public in 2000, is our 
pledge to all stakeholders to behave with integrity and respect 
for all, as well as care for the environment. See our Position on 
Ethics and Compliance.
Ethical Conduct: We maintain a Code of Ethics and Business 
Conduct that includes standards designed to promote honest 
and ethical conduct and full, fair, accurate and timely public 
disclosures. Our Chief Legal Officer serves as the compliance officer of the Code and we provide annual Team Member 
training regarding the contents and importance of the Code. 
100% of Team Members are required to complete training on 
our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct.
Compliance: As a publicly traded corporation registered with 
and licensed by multiple regulatory bodies and as required 
by the Mississippi Gaming Commission, Nevada Gaming 
Commission and New Jersey Casino Control Commission, we 
maintain a Compliance Committee which implements and 
administers our Compliance Plan. The Compliance Committee’s duties include investigating key Team Members, vendors of 
goods and services, sources of financing, consultants, lobbyists 
and others who wish to do substantial business with us or our 
subsidiaries and making recommendations to our management 
concerning suitability from an ethical and compliance 
standpoint. The Compliance Committee held four meetings  
in 202 1. A key topic of the Committee’s considerations was the 
extension of Caesars Entertainment’s compliance procedures 
to the acquired William Hill business across all dimensions 
of ethics and compliance, including updating standards and controls with the help of an external audit firm. “Ensuring Caesars Entertainment is 
always in compliance with our 
regulators  is essential to our business. 
As our company and industry continue to 
evolve, we have prioritized ensuring we 
have a robust and efficient compliance 
team. In 202 1 we established 
compliance manager positions 
at each property,  all reporting 
to the General Manager rather than 
the corporate organization. While they are still part of the corporate 
compliance team with the support 
that provides, this change brings our 
compliance team 
closer to on-the-
ground operations,  providing better 
accountability and giving our property 
teams the flexibility to handle whatever 
comes their way.  There are now more 
than 1 20 professionals dedicated to 
compliance across the Caesars Empire.”  
Jeff Hendricks
Senior Vice President &
Assistant General Counsel
Regulatory & ComplianceAnti-corruption: As part of our ethics and compliance 
programs, we maintain a focus on anti-corruption, ensuring 
familiarity of all Team Members with their responsibilities in law, 
including those of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and 
other applicable local anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and 
regulations. Our ethics training explicitly includes a module on 
anti-corruption. See our Position on Anti-corruption.
Anti-money laundering: We are committed to full 
compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and to 
preventing and detecting money laundering and other crimes 
through our gaming operations. We maintain a Bank Secrecy 
Act/Anti-money Laundering (BSA/AML) program that fosters 
an understanding of BSA/AML responsibilities across all levels 
of the organization and we implement robust procedures in 
support of this program. It includes strong governance and 
effective internal controls and procedures to comply with applicable BSA requirements, regulatory guidance and any 
related laws and to take measures to prevent its affiliated 
casinos from being used for money laundering or other criminal activity. Execution of the program is governed with reference to 
FINCEN’s guidance on the Culture of Compliance. Our internal 
AML Policy, Know Your Customer Policy and BSA Identification 
Policy outline our AML Program and set the minimum standards 
for the related procedures and internal controls of our casino 
affiliates. Team Members are required to complete annual 
trainings related company policies, including AML. See also  
our Anti-money Laundering Policy .

CHILD VICTIMS OFHUMANTRAFFICKING
©2021, Caesars License Company, LLC.ETHICAL CONDUCT  
AND COMPLIANCE
HUMAN RIGHTS
We aim to uphold human rights throughout our value chain and 
have assessed our business for human rights impact. Internally, 
our human resources policies and procedures protect the rights 
of our Team Members. We also engage an external service 
to manage an anonymous Ethics and Compliance Hotline 
for Team Members to report concerns confidentially and 
anonymously. Based on our assessment, the two most salient areas of human rights that we focus on in our Company are 
human trafficking and supply chain partnerships. 
Combating human-trafficking: We have maintained 
anti-trafficking programs including awareness, training and collaborations for many years, with the aim of eliminating 
human trafficking from our business and the hospitality industry 
in general. In 202 1, we revisited our multi-year plan, articulating 
our specific objective of creating a best-in-class anti-trafficking 
program, addressing risks and upholding anti-trafficking practice, which allowed Caesars Entertainment properties to 
combat, intercept and respond to incidents of human trafficking effectively and proactively. Our new programming continues to 
run under the guidance of our longstanding expert partner, Dr. 
Halleh Seddighzadeh, Forensic Traumatologist and Advisor in 
Sex and Labor Trafficking.
Anti-trafficking awareness and activities: In early  
2022, to revitalize Caesars Entertainment’s commitment to  
fighting human trafficking and all forms of exploitation,  
we held a one-hour companywide webinar during Human 
Trafficking Awareness Month on the theme of preventing  
human trafficking. The webinar was attended by hundreds 
of Team Members, including Team Members who had not 
previously attended company training. Additionally, our security 
teams at Caesars Entertainment completed a project with the  
Las Vegas Metro Police Department and 9 1 1 Dispatch to improve 
police response when a trafficking victim comes forth to seek 
assistance at a Caesars Entertainment property in Las Vegas.  Supply chain partnerships: Our supply chain  
comprises tens of thousands of suppliers of products and 
services required to serve our guests. We maintain a 
complex inflow of diverse goods and services ranging 
from furniture, equipment, fixtures and amenities; food and 
beverages; transportation; and IT, communications and  
other technology support systems. Our supply base is  almost entirely local and, in many cases, local to a specific  
state within the U.S. for U.S. properties. We engage with suppliers, vendors and contractors that support our values 
and are committed to acting responsibly and upholding  
human rights throughout their operations. See our 
Responsible Supplier Statement that outlines our  
expectations of our suppliers. 
Specifically, we expect suppliers to join our efforts to mitigate  
climate change and encourage their disclosure and 
performance improvement through engagement with CDP  
(see section: Mitigating Climate Change in our Supply Chain).

THIS REPORT 
Thank you for your interest in our 1 3th annual Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) Report.
•
 T
he scope of this report is Caesars Entertainment, 
Inc., the largest casino-entertainment company in the U.S., formed in 2020 following the merger of Caesars Entertainment Corporation and Eldorado Resorts, Inc.
•
 
Financial data is based on data reported in  Caesars Entertainment, Inc.’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 202 1, unless otherwise noted.
•
 Human r
esources data is shown for 202 1. 
In 202 1, following a review of Human Resources Information Systems across both legacy organizations, Team Member categorization was revised to reflect our current owner/ operated/ affiliated/franchised property structures. This means that data is not directly comparable to prior years. In 202 1, Team Members in our global headcount (GRI 102-8) are identified as Direct Employees, representing owned and operated properties in North America and Non-Direct Employees, representing tribal properties Harrah’s Cherokee and Harrah’s Cherokee Valley River in the U.S. and at Caesars Palace Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. All other data tables on human resources refer to Team Members who are Direct Employees in the U.S., except for safety (GRI 403-9, 403-10), where Non-Direct Employees are included and differences noted accordingly. For a full list of properties, see Caesars Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 202 1, pages 27-28.• En vironmental data is shown for four years and 
for our base year 20 1 1. Data for 20 1 1 and 20 1 8 is estimated. See section in our GRI Content Index: Data Compilation Methodology for details. Data in this report supersedes previous data reported for Caesars Entertainment legacy operation and includes adjustments to greenhouse gas emissions in line with GHG  protocol guidance.

as a Shared Resource
Caesars Entertainment uses water at its properties for  
the following purposes: 
•
 Gener
al hotel areas and guest rooms—hygiene  
and consumption
•HVAC and refrigeration
•Kitchen operations—food preparation•Laundry facilities •Landscape maintenance and water features
Water availability and quality are considered fundamental to 
the continuity of our business operation in the areas we operate in. The availability of freshwater and the quality of this water directly affects our customers, employees and local communities, as without quality water availability, we would not be able to operate: our customers would not be able to use our facilities, employees would not be able to work and local communities would be negatively impacted through loss of jobs and tax revenue. Investors would be affected by the reduction of revenue from any affected facilities. 
To mitigate water risk, we work with regulators and local 
authorities to help ensure freshwater availability for our facilities and engage with them regarding proposed policy changes  as needed. We support efforts to manage and remediate potential negative impacts to ecosystems and habitats where water is withdrawn or discharged.

AND RESPONSES 
Water availability is factored into our risk assessment throughout 
the organization. Our primary procedure for identifying and assessing risk is through the completion of a robust, bi-annual water risk assessment performed independently of other risks.  In our assessment of water risk as a standalone issue,  Caesars Entertainment is able to measure and classify the potential impact of water-related risk at both the company  and facility level. To do this, we use information gathered by our Enterprise Risk Management, Sustainable Operations,  and Facilities & Engineering teams, along with using the  WRI’s Aqueduct tool to complete our water risk assessment. Declining water quality, increased water stress and flooding have been identified as the most common water risks with the potential to have a substantive financial or strategic impact  on our business. 
We continue efforts to decrease freshwater withdrawal 
through the use of water efficient technologies, Team Member education, guest communications (for example, to reduce laundry needs) and engagement with suppliers who influence water usage.   
GRI 303-2: Management of Water  
Discharge-Related Impacts
 
We estimate that less than 1 5% of our water usage is consumed by customers or used for irrigation. The majority of our water is used on site either as process water or by our guests and Team Members and returned directly to the sewer system. We directly monitor the discharge of cooling water, which is our highest property water usage and goes directly into the sewer system  to water treatment facilities where it is managed/treated by those municipalities.  
 
GRI 303-3: Water Withdrawal
Note: 100% of water withdrawal is sourced as freshwater (≤1,000 mg/L Total Dissolved Solids) from non-water-stressed areas.
GRI 303-4 Water Discharge
Note: 100% of water discharged comprises freshwater (≤1,000 mg/L Total Dissolved Solids) from non-water-stressed areas.

waste-related impacts
 
At Caesars, in our ongoing operations, waste generated is typical of any hospitality organization, consisting of mainly paper products, plastics, glass and unconsumed organics.  The majority of our waste is discarded by guests who stay or play at our properties. Construction waste is generated through construction and renovation activities when such projects occur. Furniture and equipment from such activities are usually donated.  
GRI 306-2: Management of significant  
waste-related impacts
 
Caesars maintains strict controls over significant waste  related impacts. Our largest properties have on-site sorting which segregates waste streams for recycling or reuse as well  as asset recovery. Wherever possible, we aim to divert waste from landfills and donate as much surplus or unused food to local food banks or other nonprofits and furniture and supplies to local nonprofits. Construction waste is recycled wherever possible by our contractors.
Waste generated is carefully monitored at each property by 
CodeGreen leaders or by vendors by requiring all waste and recycling streams to be weighed.

OVERVIEW 
The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 
framework, developed by the Financial Stability Board (FSB),  is a voluntary framework that facilitates effective climate-related disclosures that could promote informed investment, credit and insurance underwriting decisions. In the light of interest from the investor community in this disclosure framework, we have prepared an overview of our current operations in line with the TCFD recommendations. 
For further information, see also our CDP Climate Change 
Submissions and our 202 1-2022 CSR Report - PEOPLE  PLANET PLAY, which is available on our website. 
1 GOVERNANCE 
1. 1 BOARD OVERSIGHT 
Caesars Entertainment’s Board of Directors and senior 
executives view Corporate Social Responsibility as an  integral element in the way the company does business  and makes decisions. The Board believes that being a  good corporate citizen helps protect the company against risk, contributes to improved business results and helps foster positive relationships with all those who have a connection to our business. As such, the Board takes an active role in oversight of climate-related issues through review and guidance on information provided by the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee (CSRC), a committee of the Board composed of three board members. The CSRC meets at least quarterly. The CSRC is responsible for climate-related issues and is appointed by and acts on behalf of the Board of Directors. The CSRC evaluates emergent environmental, social and governance-related risks and our goals and targets, as well as the policies and programs instrumental in achieving short and long-term targets for emissions, waste and supplier engagement. For example, the CSRC approved Caesars Entertainment’s Science Based Targets (SBTs) developed in 20 1 8 and a further, more ambitious target in 20 1 9, following new SBTi guidance for developing SBTs, to align with well-below the two degrees Celsius temperature level. Periodically and at least annually, management prepares and presents to the CSRC a review of ESG-related risks, including climate-related issues. The CSRC also evaluates programs and policies instrumental in achieving short and long-term climate-related goals. The Committee also draws upon external expertise in climate-related issues, sustainability and social issues from the CEO-level External CSR Advisory Council (EAC) and NGO partners.
Reviewing and guiding strategy/risk  
management policies:  The CSRC provides strategic oversight of the company’s social and environmental responsibility goals and performance as well as emergent environmental, social and governance-related risks. The ability of the CSRC to bring pertinent climate-related issues and progress toward targets to the Board as frequently as necessary allows the Board to provide rapid feedback on overall strategy for climate-related issues.
 Reviewing and guiding major plans of action:  
Caesars Entertainment’s Board of Directors reviews major plans of action designed for climate-related issues.

OVERVIEW
1.2 MANAGEMENT´S ROLE
Caesars Entertainment’s environmental strategy is supported by 
departments including, Engineering and Asset Management/Sustainable Operations team, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) team and property executive teams. The program is overseen directly by the CSRC, with direction from relevant department leaders and Caesars Entertainment’s senior management team led by the CEO. Climate-related metrics and KPIs are traced and reported regularly to the senior executive team and to the CSRC. 
2. STRATEGY
2A. CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS  
AND OPPORTUNITIES  
Caesars Entertainment completes a periodic Climate Change 
Risk Assessment that encompasses the company’s strategic, financial, legal and regulatory, reputational and operational risks and opportunities at the company level. The Company reviews on-site audits and monthly energy and water data to identify risks and opportunities at the property level. 
Generally, Caesars defines substantive financial and strategic 
impact to mean those climate-related impacts that pose a significant financial, reputational, social or asset impacts that affect our brand, our ability to operate as a business or our ability to attract and retain customers. More specifically, Caesars uses the following quantifiable indicators as a threshold for defining substantive financial or strategic impact:
•
 T
he proportion of business units affected: If occurring  
at more than one property this would pose a  significant risk.
•
 T
he size of the impact on those business units: If there is 
sizeable financial impact, this would trigger executive level review and prioritization ranking with all other recognized risks and impacts. Additionally, strategic impacts are considered as part of our reputational risk analysis. If the impact could affect our ability to be selected as the partner of choice by regulators, business partners or corporate customers, or affect our ability to attract and retain talent.
•
 T
he dependency of the organization on that unit:  
As an operator of more than 50 properties, our organization depends on the operation of all  business units. Some regions have only one property serving a major metropolitan area. Should we lose a business unit in a market with one property, this would  be a significant impact.•
 T
he potential for shareholder or customer concern:  
Any property closure (temporary or extended) will lead to revenue loss and could cause our customers to travel to competitors’ sites, potentially losing those customers  in the future.
•
 Str
ategic operational impact: As a resort operator, 
any climate-related risk or opportunity could have a substantive financial or strategic impact if occurring at more than one property. For example, if a climate-related risk forced the temporary closure or partial closure of multiple properties, this represents a large portion of our portfolio.

OVERVIEW
3. RISK MANAGEMENT
3A. PROCESS TO IDENTIFY CLIMATE 
CHANGE RISK
The CSRC advises and directs the strategy relating to 
short, medium and long-term risk factors across emergent environmental, social and governance-related risks, including climate-related risk. The CSRC is responsible for approving social and environmental goals and is tasked with monitoring  the policies and programs instrumental in achieving our short  and long-term targets.  
We complete a periodic Climate Change Risk Assessment  
that reviews the environmental performance of our properties and specific areas of exposure to climate risk at the  corporate and property level and through our value chain. Caesars Entertainment’s materiality assessment contributes  to our evaluation of the potential size and scope of identified ESG and climate-related risks with primary consideration for  risk categorization being:
•The estimated likelihood of the risk occurring 
•
 T
he relative financial impact to the company should the 
risk manifest 
•
 T
he significance of the risk impacting the company’s 
social and environmental goalsGenerally, the company level substantive financial risk  
threshold equates to an assessed financial impact of  $50,000 or greater and triggers executive level review  and prioritization ranking. Examples of identified and assessed company level risks include cost and availability of reliable electricity sources, state RPS requirements, local and federal legislation, emission requirements and reputational impact  of our sustainability programs to attract new customers.  We consider risks and opportunities greater than six years  into the future. 
3B. PROCESS TO MANAGE CLIMATE 
CHANGE RISKS
At the asset level, risks are identified by the Engineering and Asset Management/Sustainable Operations group by working with property leadership and facilities teams. The group conducts on-site property audits quarterly to identify risks and opportunities at the property level. Sustainable Operations reports risks and/or opportunities identified at the company level to any affected sites. These risks are quantified and prioritized  by their size and relative scope for site operational impacts. Capital allocation is incorporated into our facilities’ operating budgets when mitigation action is required. For example, our coastal and flood plain sites have set aside additional budget to mitigate, prepare and respond to the identified risks of flooding, hurricane damage and other extreme weather events.3C. CLIMATE CHANGE INTEGRATION
Caesars Entertainment’s overall business strategy integrates goals around growth, profitability and industry leadership while fulfilling its commitments to customers, employees, the communities in which it operates and environmental stewardship. Caesars Entertainment’s formal commitment to environmental stewardship and energy efficiency began in 2008, when it organized technical, policy, stakeholder and community engagement functions to establish a companywide sustainability strategy then called, “CodeGreen,” now referred to as our PLANET strategy.
Process for influencing strategy: At the operational level, 
corporate CodeGreen staff provides strategic direction and resources to individual CodeGreen teams at every property. These teams consist of a formal lead with a cross-functional  team of employees and are responsible for addressing the critical issues of energy, GHG emissions, waste and water.  Each team is responsible for implementing CodeGreen targets and standard operating procedures related to food & beverage (F&B), housekeeping and responsible meetings. Additionally, teams focus on reducing utility usage, increasing employee participation in programs and events and improving guest engagement scores. 
Customers and community partners are engaged to support 
environmental issues and CodeGreen initiatives through marketing campaigns and educational communication  on property, direct marketing and via social media.

For details of our emissions calculation methodology, please see Caesars Entertainment 202 1-2022 CSR Report, Appendix,  
GRI Data Tables and Responses. 
4C. TARGETS
Climate: Reduce absolute Scope 1+2 emissions by 35% by 2025 and 100% by 2050 from a 20 1 1 base-year.  
We plan to resubmit more ambitious emissions reduction targets to the Science Based Targets initiative in 2023. 
Suppliers: 60% of suppliers by spend will institute Science Based GHG reduction targets for their operations by 2023.TCFD  
OVERVIEW
Caesars Entertainment’s science-based targets show how  
the business strategy has been influenced by climate-related issues, as science-based targets tie corporate financial goals  to environmental outcomes. To set the targets, Caesars utilized the Sectoral Decarbonization Approach, which takes into account sector-based carbon intensity and corporate  growth rates. Once our initial targets were set, we evaluated  the environmental programs and associated corporate investments necessary to achieve these targets, forecasting these activities and costs out to 2050. Following approval by our senior management team, the CSRC and the Board, our science-based targets and programs and associated investments were incorporated into Caesars business strategy including future corporate financial planning.
