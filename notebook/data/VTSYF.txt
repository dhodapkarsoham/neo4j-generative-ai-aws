the Right Way
AppendixBuilding on our 80 years of expertise, we continue 
to improve the sustainability of our enterprise 
year after year. From our humble beginnings as an 
affordable source of nutrition for Hong Kong people 
in 1940, we have witnessed transformative changes 
locally and around the world. In this changing market 
landscape, we are working at the same time to scale 
our operations whilst improving our sustainability 
practices so to be more beneficial to the environment 
and society. 
Over the past year, we have further enhanced 
our sustainability governance structure with the 
establishment of a Board-level Environmental, Social, 
and Governance (ESG) Committee to oversee our 
sustainability issues. Through the ESG Committee’s 
oversight, our Board is now able to assess ESG 
risks and provide strategic long-term guidance on 
sustainability performance, goals and priorities. We 
have also implemented new ESG-related policies and 
guidelines including the Group Climate Change Policy, 
Group Fair Labour Practices Policy and Sustainable 
Farming Guidelines. These new developments 
are embedded into how we conduct our business 
as we create long-term sustainable value for our 
shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers and 
the communities where we operate. Chairman’s  
Message
As Vitasoy progresses along our sustainability 
journey, we remain loyal to our core mission to 
deliver tasty and sustainable plant-based food and 
beverages to more and more communities. Our 
plant-based portfolio offers not only nutritional and 
health benefits, but also a comparatively low carbon 
footprint and environmental impact (less water, land 
use). We continue to broaden our impact via both 
innovation and expansion into new markets.

Making Products  
the Right Way
AppendixOur Sustainability Framework of Making the Right 
Products and Making Products the Right Way 
focuses our efforts and contributions towards the 
most material issues. These are connected to the 
goals of the 2030 Agenda outlined in the United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
Our long-term objectives will be achieved through 
specific workstreams, whose progress is tracked by 
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) which are shared 
in detail within this report. As of this year, we have 
met or exceeded all our 2020/21 goals in product 
portfolio and packaging, and stayed on track to 
achieve the related 2025/26 goals. This report shares 
the steps we have taken towards achieving our per-
unit water, electricity, and fuel performance goals. 
Nourish Your Body, Nourish Your Mind remains the 
centre of our community engagement strategy. To 
that end we have launched a new Beverage Carton 
Clean Recycling Education Programme in Hong Kong 
to reduce packaging waste.
We have further enhanced the quality of our 
disclosures and provided our stakeholders with a 
better understanding of our sustainability practices. 
The information in this Report was developed in 
accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
Standards, an international reporting framework, and 
has obtained independent third-party verification. 
This year, we have started to align our climate change 
related disclosure to the recommendations of the 
Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD). 
Our efforts to continuously strive for excellence in 
sustainability has received local and international 
recognition. Vitasoy International Holdings Limited, 
for the first time, entered the Corporate Knights 
ranking of the “Top 100 Global Sustainable 
Companies” and has been included in the Hang Seng Corporate Sustainability Index as one of the Top 30 
Hong Kong listed companies demonstrating best in 
class sustainability performance. 
As we celebrate 80 years of plant-based nutrition, 
we honour our founder’s vision through continuous 
innovation and sustainable growth. Although we 
formalised our Sustainability Framework in 2015, we 
have been Making the Right Products and Making 
Products the Right Way since 1940. We invite you to 
join our journey and thank you for taking the time to 
read our report.

VERIFICATION 
STATEMENT
Scope of Verification
Hong Kong Quality Assurance Agency (“HKQAA”) has 
been engaged by Vitasoy International Holdings Ltd. 
(Vitasoy) to undertake an independent verification 
for its Sustainability Report 2019/20 (“The Report”). 
The scope of HKQAA’s verification covers the 
sustainability data and information of Vitasoy from 
1st April 2019 to 31st March 2020. 
The aim of this verification is to provide a reasonable 
assurance on the reliability of the report contents. 
The Report has been prepared in accordance with the 
Global Reporting Initiatives (“GRI”) Standards: Core 
option and the Environmental, Social and Governance 
Reporting Guide (“ESG Guide”) issued by the Hong 
Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (“HKEx”).
Level of Assurance and 
Methodology
The process applied in this verification was based on 
the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 
3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements Other than 
Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information 
issued by the International Auditing and Assurance 
Standards Board. Our evidence gathering process was designed to obtain a reasonable level of assurance as 
set out in the standard for the purpose of devising the 
verification conclusion. The extent of this verification 
process undertaken covered the criteria set in the 
GRI Standards: Core option and the ESG Guide.
HKQAA’s verification process included verifying the 
mechanisms for collecting, calculating and reporting 
the sustainability performance information, reviewing 
relevant documented information, interviewing 
responsible personnel with accountability for 
preparing the Report and verifying selected 
representative samples of data and information. Raw 
data and supporting evidence of the selected samples 
were thoroughly examined during the verification 
process.
Independence
Vitasoy is responsible for the collection and 
presentation of the information presented. HKQAA 
does not involve in calculating, compiling, or in the 
development of the Report. Our verification activities 
are entirely independent from Vitasoy.
Conclusion
Based on the verification results and in accordance 
with the verification procedures undertaken, HKQAA 
has obtained reasonable assurance and is in the 
opinion that:
• The Report has been prepared in accordance 
with the GRI Standards: Core option and the ESG 
Guide of HKEx. The key performance indicators 
specified in the ESG Reporting Guide has been 
adequately addressed; • The Report illustrates the sustainability 
performance of Vitasoy’s material topics in a 
balanced, comparable, clear and timely manner; 
and
• The data and information disclosed in the Report 
are reliable and complete.
Vitasoy identified its material topics through a 
thorough materiality assessment process. The 
material matrix covered the consideration of issues 
that are of importance to the company and with high 
level of stakeholders’ interest as well as the perceived 
ability of Vitasoy to make a positive difference. In 
conclusion, the Report disclosure is commensurate 
with Vitasoy’s sustainability context and materiality.

AppendixOur Material Issues
We identified a list of potentially material topics 
through a formalised assessment process. The 
materiality matrix presents these topics based on 
their importance to our stakeholders and the potential 
impact they have on the success of our business. 
This year, we identified climate change as one topic 
which has become increasingly impactful to Vitasoy. 
Droughts in Australia exacerbated by climate change 
have significantly affected the supply of soybeans 
which in turn impacted our business in the region. 
While our focus remain on addressing the most 
material issues, we will continue to manage all issues 
affecting Vitasoy and our stakeholders. We will also 
dedicate our reporting efforts on our top material 
issues through the disclosure of relevant KPIs, targets 
or initiatives which are described in subsequent 
chapters of this Report. For details of our materiality 
matrix, please refer to the Materiality Assessment

Making nutritious and tasty plant-based food 
and beverages has been Vitasoy’s heritage since 
its establishment. In a time of food shortages, 
malnutrition and soaring commodity prices, Dr. K. 
S. Lo created the first ready-to-drink soy milk to 
offer the people of Hong Kong an affordable and 
healthy alternative to dairy milk.
Drawing on 80 years of expertise, Vitasoy’s product 
portfolio is available in about 40 markets with 
manufacturing facilities in Hong Kong, Mainland 
China, Singapore, Australia and the Philippines. As 
we scale up our business, we remain committed 
to our founding vision of providing sustainable 
plant-based beverages and food products which 
are good for the people and the planet while 
innovating to embrace opportunities.

SUSTAINABILITY VISION  (Continued) 
AppendixAlongside our commitments to operating business 
sustainably, we are also cognisant of our role within 
an international context. The global challenges of 
population growth and natural resource availability are 
becoming increasingly prevalent across all industries 
worldwide. Coupled with climate change, the negative 
impacts of these global challenges exacerbate other 
concerns such as accessibility to nutritious food 
and food security. In response to these challenges, 
governments and private organisations are working 
together to mitigate the risks through their support 
of the United Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs). Vitasoy has identified the SDGs most 
applicable to our business and thus are the most 
relevant for strategic alignment. Please visit the SDGs 
website  to learn more about these goals.

SUSTAINABILITY FRAMEWORK AND GOVERNANCE
AppendixOur Sustainability Framework takes a holistic 
approach to the alignment of our ESG issues and our 
business focus areas. Since achieving organisational 
alignment under this Framework, our sustainability 
strategies have become more efficiently implemented 
across our operations. Presided over by the Vitasoy 
Board, Vitasoy’s management team developed the 
Framework to consist of two major pillars:
Taste and nutrition are important considerations during 
the development of our product offerings. We support 
healthy consumer choices by providing great tasting 
plant-based beverages with low fat and low sugar 
content. To deliver our product to consumers safely 
and sustainably, Vitasoy has focused on evaluating 
and minimising packaging impacts on the environment 
without compromising our product quality. Working together with our stakeholders and partners, 
Vitasoy strives to conduct our business in a manner 
which is sustainable for the environment and its natural 
resources, promotes responsible procurement practices, 
creates a safe and inclusive workplace, and fosters 
community development. Making the Right Products Making Products the Right Way

On an operation level, our Group Executive Sustainability Committee (“Sustainability Committee”) reports to the above mentioned ESG Committee, 
recommending goals, strategies and initiatives, overseeing their communication and implementation across the Company, and integrating sustainability into 
day-to-day operations. Chaired by the Group Director-Sustainability & Corporate Communications, the Sustainability Committee meets quarterly together 
with the Group Chief Executive Officer, the function heads and the market heads. Their output and recommendations are endorsed by the Board, for the 
Executive Team to then drive ESG performance accordingly.
Governance and Risks
Our business nature and the environment in which we operate exposes us to potential risks that could impact the sustainability of our Company. The Board 
has the oversight on material ESG issues, including their associated risks and opportunities. While its Audit Committee oversees the Company’s overall 
risk management and governance issues, the ESG Committee specifically assesses environmental and social risks, advises the Board on risks of strategic 
significance and provides anticipatory and mitigation plans. Correspondingly, the relevant material risks are integrated into our Enterprise Risk Management 
Framework to be monitored and proactively mitigated along with othe r business risks. 
Material ESG Issues
We identify, evaluate and prioritise ESG issues through regular internal and external stakeholder engagements. Our focus has been based on previously 
conducted independent third-party materiality assessment, results of which were discussed and endorsed by the Sustainability Committee. Based on these 
prioritised issues, we develop and update corresponding group policies to be implemented by relevant functions with the support of local leadership teams. 
We also regularly review international sustainability trends and benchma rk against our peers to stimulate continuous improvement. 
Details on our governance and management approach on ESG issues, including our goals, targets and progress are disclosed in our Annual Report , 
Sustainability Report  and corporate website .

ᗆйOur risk management framework allows Vitasoy to 
effectively balance risks and opportunities and drive 
the long-term s ustainability  of our business. We 
understand that potential risks are inherent to the 
nature of our business and the environment in which 
we operate. These risks, which are not limited to ESG 
issues, include climate change, fair labour practices, 
and responsible raw material sourcing. Through 
our risk management framework, we monitor them 
closely. To learn more about our risk management, 
please refer to the Governance  section of our 
Sustainability website.
Sustainability Risk Management
The management of sustainability risks is embedded 
within the Vitasoy Enterprise Risk Management 
(ERM) Framework and includes considerations of 
ESG risks alongside other business risks. During the 
year, ESG risks were further integrated with other 
relevant business and operational risks to monitor and 
mitigate relevant risk areas more comprehensively. 
All risk items with ESG considerations are indicated in 
the Risk Register and require respective Risk Owners 
to include ESG implications when implementing 
the Anticipate, Rate and Response ERM Processes. 
In conjunction with the improved alignment with 
our ERM, Vitasoy conducted an assessment of 
potential ESG issues embedded in our supply chain 
by leveraging recognised risk assessment tools such 
as the World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct and 
Global Forest Watch and the World Wide Fund for 
Nature’s Water Risk Filter. The analysis provides a 
more expansive perspective on our sustainability risks 
beyond our immediate scope of operations.

BUSINESS ETHICS AND INTEGRITY
AppendixBusiness Ethics is one of the top material issues 
identified by our stakeholders. The Group maintains 
our high standards of business ethics and corporate 
governance through the Group’s Business Ethics 
Policy and the Code of Business Conduct for 
Suppliers and Customers. Vitasoy has zero tolerance 
for all forms of corruption and bribery.The Group Business Ethics Policy sets out the 
guiding principles for ethical business conduct 
which all staff must adopt. Included in the Policy are 
stipulations related to compliance with laws, rules 
and regulations, conflict of interest, employment 
of immediate family members and relatives, anti-
corruption, and bribery. To further reinforce the 
Policy, Vitasoy has revised the existing policy 
with specific sections on anti-bribery and anti-
corruption over the past year. 
Vitasoy sets clear guidelines and expectations 
for ethical conduct from our suppliers and 
customers through the Code of Business Conduct 
for Suppliers and Customers. Included in these guidelines are stipulations related to conflict of 
interest, anti-corruption and fraud, which are applied 
irrespective of country and territory. To support 
ethical conduct along our value chain, the Code also 
provides direction for local entities to incorporate the 
relevant guidelines into agreements with suppliers 
and customers. 
We encourage all staff and business partners to 
raise their concerns if they have any suspicions of 
misconduct, malpractice, or irregularities through 
our Whistleblowing Policy. Vitasoy has set up an 
independent channel to report such cases. All 
concerns raised through this channel are directly 
handled by the Group Internal Audit and Risk 
Management Department for further investigation. 
To disseminate information on Vitasoy’s principles 
and values and to align the behaviour of our 
employees, suppliers, and customers with our 
expectations, we provide training to all staff through 
our e-learning programme established in 2018. 
This year, we provided additional refresher training 
through e-learning specifically aimed towards general 
operations, tuck shop operations, Mainland China 
sales staff, distributors, and suppliers. Anti-corruption 
and anti-bribery information were also covered 
in the e-learning programme. To further confirm 
our staff understand Vitasoy’s ethical standards, 
all staff are required to sign the Business Ethics 
Commitment Declaration Form to demonstrate their 
full understanding and compliance with the Group 
Business Ethics Policy as well as their responsibility 
and obligation to report any case of misconduct or 
irregular behaviour. Throughout the year, Vitasoy also 
publishes relevant articles under the “Business Ethics” 
Section of Vitasoy News to keep our employees up-
to-date on the latest information on ethical conduct.

Plant-based beverages continue to be Vitasoy’s main 
focus. Our current product portfolio consists of 91% 
plant-based beverages. Furthermore, all new product 
formulations launched in 2019/20 were plant-based 
in helping us to surpass our 2025/26 goal to maintain 
our plant-based product portfolio at or above 90%. 
Nutritious Plant Milk
In support of healthy diets and the nutritional needs 
of our consumers, Vitasoy has allocated resources 
to launch more nutritious plant milk options. Plant 
milks are an excellent source of nutrients such as 
protein, dietary fibre, and antioxidants; many plant 
milk options are also fortified with essential vitamins 
and minerals such a vitamin B6, B12, D and calcium 
and are free of lactose, which make them a suitable 
source of nutrition for health-conscious individuals, 
vegetarians and people with lactose intolerance. 
Over the past year, the proportion of plant milk 
products which meet nutritious beverage criteria 
further increased to 96% from 93%, surpassing our 
2025/26 goal of maintaining at 95% or above well 
ahead of schedule.

As the general public grows more aware of their daily 
consumption of sugar, Vitasoy has increased the 
proportion of products which meet moderate to zero 
sugar levels. Since 2015/16, we have achieved a 17% 
total increase of moderate to zero sugar products in 
our portfolio to 80% this year. The main driver of this 
progress was a focus on the development of more 
moderate to zero sugar beverages, as well as the 
reformulation of our existing products to reduce the 
sugar content.

We are increasing the use of certified organic 
soybeans in our portfolio as well as launching new 
USDA NOP² organic certified products.Reducing artificial ingredients
To demonstrate our commitment to providing 
nutritious products with more natural ingredients 
for our consumers, we have reduced the use of 
artificial ingredients such as artificial flavours and 
colours. Moreover, our entire range of products 
are 100% free of added preservatives and our 
reformulation programmes further reduce the use of 
artificial ingredients. In 2019/20, we had successfully 
eliminated the use of artificial flavours in our Australia 
VITASOY Soy Milky range. Maintaining low sodium levels
Beverages are not a major source of salt and sodium 
intake. As beverage manufacturing is our main 
business, our overall product portfolio contains 
relatively low sodium content. We shall maintain low 
sodium content in all of Vitasoy’s beverage offerings 
as we continue to limit the use of salt in the products.

PRODUCT PACKAGING
AppendixOur packaging serves as the storage, transportation 
and delivery system for our products. We place a high 
degree of care on the hygiene, safety, strength and 
durability of any packaging materials we use. We also 
recognise that the waste generated when consumers 
discard our product packaging has a big impact on 
the environment and have worked to adopt more 
efficient and less wasteful alternatives. We also have 
a dedicated team working on more environmentally-
friendly alternatives. Guiding our decisions relating to packaging is our 
Group Responsible Packaging Policy. The policy 
pertains to both primary packaging which is in direct 
contact with products, such as bottles and carton 
packs, and secondary packaging which refers to 
materials used on top of primary packaging. This 
policy aligns with our commitment to reducing 
the environmental impacts of our packaging while 
safeguarding the quality and safety of our products 
through four focus areas: material choice and 
usage, packaging weight optimisation, operations 
considerations, and innovation. For more details on 
our Group Responsible Packaging Policy, please refer 
to the Policies  section of our Sustainability website. 
We have conducted a packaging life cycle assessment 
on both primary and secondary packaging to allow us 
to understand the impact and identify improvement opportunities along the life cycle stages. Equipped 
with the results of this assessment, we are weighing 
the costs and benefits of alternative packaging 
solutions to most efficiently and holistically reduce 
our environmental impacts. 
To enhance beverage carton recycling capabilities 
in Hong Kong, we launched the Beverage Carton 
Clean Recycling Education Programme to collect 
and recycle beverage cartons as well as to educate 
students and the local community on recycling. 
Under this programme, we worked closely with Mil 
Mill to increase carton recycling collection points and 
opened the Beverage Carton Sustainability Education 
Centre on their premises. Vitasoy has furthered our 
involvement in Hong Kong’s sustainability efforts 
through the implementation of various initiatives 
including reverse vending machines.

COMMUNICATING WITH CONSUMERS
AppendixProduct Labelling
When it comes to food and beverage products, 
consumers are faced with a plethora of choices every 
day. Vitasoy’s Group Product Health and Nutrition 
Policy  includes principles and commitments to 
provide consumers with accurate and reader friendly 
nutritional information to encourage healthy well-
informed decisions. The commitments formalised 
under this policy include labelling of ingredients, 
allergens, and nutritional information on our product 
packaging. Vitasoy continues to improve nutritional 
communication by adopting simple icons to illustrate 
key nutritional information or benefits directly on the 
packaging. To further help consumers understand 
the nutritional value of our products, we remain 
participants of various voluntary graphical labelling 
schemes, including the Health Star Rating, front-of-
pack labelling system in Australia, Healthier Choice 
Symbol Programme in Singapore, and the Salt/Sugar 
Label Scheme for Pre-packaged Food Products in 
Hong Kong. 
In Mainland China, we have begun to provide QR 
codes on a variety of product lines, including our 
VITASOY Soy Milk range, VITASOY Health Plus range, 
VITA No Sugar Tea range, VITA Chrysanthemum Tea, 
and VITA Lemon Tea. Those who scan the QR code 
will be redirected to Vitasoy’s WeChat page, which 
contains easily accessible articles on the nutritional 
benefits of soy milk and other plant-based products. 
For more information on product labelling and 
nutrition information, please refer to our Group 
Product Health and Nutrition Policy .Consumer Privacy
As stipulated in our Internet Privacy Policy , Vitasoy 
has taken the relevant steps to safeguard the 
privacy of our website visitors and to protect their

MANUFACTURING
In connection to our environmental progress and 
overall performance in 2019/20, we will focus on the 
relevant issues as determined through discussions 
and other engagements with our stakeholders. 
Amid these dialogues with internal and external 
stakeholder groups, it became clear that climate 
change, water stewardship, energy efficiency and 
waste management were fundamental issues to both 
Vitasoy and our stakeholders. 
Amid the COVID-19 outbreak, we have experienced 
an overall decrease in production and resource usage 
but this also translated to a lower KPI efficiency due 
to ongoing maintenance of necessary facilities such 
as waste water treatment, cold room for raw materials 
and emergency lighting. Despite the challenging 
situation, we still achieved some reductions across all 
three metrics of water, electricity and fuel usages per 
unit production. We are confident that once we can 
assume normal operations, we will be able to achieve 
better resource efficiency and progress towards 
meeting our goals for the following years.ENVIRONMENTAL 
RISK
For the first time, environmental risks represent the 
top five global risks in terms of likelihood according 
to the World Economic Forum Global Risks Report 
2020. These risks are extreme weather events 
such as floods and storms; failure of climate change 
mitigation and adaptation; major natural disasters 
such as earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions 
and geomagnetic storms; major biodiversity loss and 
ecosystem collapse; and human-made environmental 
damage and disasters. The agricultural industry faces 
pronounced climate-related risks including decreased 
crop yields as a result of water scarcity and shifts in 
seasonal rainfall and temperatures. Vitasoy relies on 
agricultural outputs as key ingredients and we have 
already experienced the near-term consequences of 
climate risks in our value chain. In Australia, soybean 
crop yields declined due to prolonged drought has 
affected our production in the country. We have 
taken steps to better understand and mitigate 
the impacts of climate change on our ability to 
produce plant-based product portfolio. This year, we 
introduced our Group Climate Change Policy  which 
outlines our approach to mitigation, adaptation and 
resilience applied to our whole value chain. We 
have also started to align our disclosures based on 
the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-
related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) of the Financial 
Stability Board. Vitasoy’s portfolio of plant-based products has a 
comparatively lower impact on the environment in 
terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water 
consumption, and land use than animal-based food 
and beverages3. Nonetheless, we are committed to 
contributing to the protection of the Earth’s natural 
resources. Aligned with our Sustainability Framework is 
the Group Environmental Policy  which systematically 
lays out our management approach to water and 
energy consumption, raw material sourcing, and the 
reduction of waste and GHG emissions. Seeking to 
embed sustainable practices throughout our value 
chain, our newly launched Sustainable Farming 
Guidelines  outline our expectations with regards 
to agricultural production such as fertiliser and pest 
management, water conservation, energy use, waste 
disposal, biodiversity and workplace conditions. See 
the Policy Formulation and Implementation  section 
for more details.

What Matters
AppendixRegardless of the industry or size of the company, 
climate change affects all businesses worldwide. 
Vitasoy has taken steps to holistically embed a 
clear understanding of climate change across 
the organisation by aligning with the disclosure 
recommendations provided by the TCFD. These 
disclosures help us to raise awareness of climate 
change risks and opportunities, and communicate 
information from Senior Management down to the 
front lines and vice versa. In addition to the raw materials necessary to produce 
our food and beverage offerings, energy is a key 
input for Vitasoy to maintain smooth operations. 
We recognise the importance of the responsible 
management of these resources, which include the 
direct and indirect consumption of electricity and 
fuel. The Group Climate Change Policy  details our 
approach to mitigation which includes adopting 
industry best practices to reduce emissions and 
increasing the use of renewable energy across our

manufacturing sites. In line with our approach, we 
have implemented energy management initiatives 
to increase our energy efficiency. For instance, 
according to different process requirements, we 
have strengthened the syrup cooling control and 
pipe network application. In addition, we changed 
the traditional air-cooled cooling system to a water-
cooled cooling system, thereby improving the 
refrigeration efficiency, and added heat insulation 
materials on the steam components to prevent heat 
loss.

CLIMATE CHANGE AND EMISSIONS MANAGEMENT  (continued)
Appendix Governance
Vitasoy’s Board-level ESG Committee provides long-
term guidance on the Company’s sustainability goals, 
strategies, and priorities and reports details to the 
Board. 
We have also formulated a Group Climate Change 
Policy, which was reviewed by the ESG Committee, 
to guide our management approach and strategy on 
climate change mitigation, adaptation, and resilience. 
For more details on Vitasoy’s climate change 
governance, please refer to the Policy Formation 
and Implementation  section and the Sustainability at 
Vitasoy  section. 
 Strategy
Our objectives and business focus areas are aligned 
with the Vitasoy Sustainability Framework to minimise 
our carbon footprint and address the climate risks 
we face. We have committed to the implementation 
of an Environmental Management System aligned 
with the ISO 14001 international standard at all our 
manufacturing sites to more effectively manage our 
climate change issues. 
To strengthen our climate change resilience and 
ensure business continuity, we regularly engage our 
suppliers and contract farmers to identify practical 
means to improve their agricultural systems through 
the implementation of our Sustainable Farming 
Guidelines. Risk Management
The evaluation and management of our sustainability 
risk is well integrated with the Vitasoy ERM 
Framework. Any business risk with ESG considerations 
are indicated in the Risk Register. Respective Risk 
Owners are required to include ESG implications 
when implementing the ERM Processes (anticipate, 
rate and respond to risk items). Moreover, a dedicated 
risk analysis has been conducted to identify and 
assess sustainability risk relating to the sourcing of 
our supplies. This provides additional insights into our 
exposure to sustainability risks.
 Metrics and Targets
Our Group-wide GHG inventory summary was 
prepared in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, 
an internationally accepted standard developed by the 
World Business Council for Sustainable Development 
and the World Resources Institute. Our GHG inventory 
accounts for our operations which directly and indirectly 
contribute to carbon emissions. 
The majority of our direct (scope 1) emissions arise from 
the fuel burned in our boilers during the production 
process, while our indirect (scope 2) emissions are 
primarily due to electricity consumption throughout 
Vitasoy’s operations. In 2019/20, our total Group-wide 
GHG emissions were 134,719 tonnes, which equates to 
an intensity of 0.126 kgCO 2e/kg of production. Vitasoy 
continuously evaluates climate impacts across each of 
our major operational divisions, including production, 
transportation, packaging, and cultivation.We have 2 relevant targets. The first one is to reduce 
the amount of electricity used to manufacture each unit 
of product by 25% by 2025/26 against 2013/14 level; 
The second one is to reduce the amount of fuel used to 
manufacture each unit of product by 25% by 2025/26 
against 2013/14 level. We are currently working to 
determine carbon reduction targets to guide us towards 
further reduction in our carbon emissions.

WATER MANAGEMENT AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
Appendix
⁴ Identified by World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas.Water Management  
Potential droughts and water scarcity are risks that 
may significantly affect our production and supply 
chain. To elevate our water stewardship, we have 
conducted a water risk analysis which includes 
mapping water risks on current and 2030 scenarios⁴. 
The risk types which were identified for the risk 
assessment include overall water risk, baseline water 
stress, drought, flooding, and reputational risks.
In order to keep up production of our food and 
beverages, we require a large and steady supply of 
clean fresh water. Currently, 100% of the water we 
use in our manufacturing processes within the scope 
of this report comes from municipal water sources 
except our new plant in the Philippines. To ensure 
that the water meets our high purity standards, 
we utilise a stringent purification treatment and 
distillation process.
Vitasoy is committed to efficient water usage without 
sacrificing the quality and safety of our food and 
beverages. We have already begun to implement 
initiatives to improve the efficiency of our Reverse 
Osmosis water treatment system.Waste Management
The main waste output resulting from our production 
process is “okara”, a solid residue which is the by-
product of soy milk production. Having steadily 
improved our recycling rate over time, we have 
achieved our goal of a 99% okara recycling rate 
this year. We have also been exploring alternative 
methods to retain the nutrition value of okara to 
promote circular waste systems. 
Comparatively, commercial and other production 
solid wastes such as plastic, scrap metal and paper 
comprise a relatively small percentage of our overall 
waste output according to the waste assessment 
conducted last year. Due to the nature of our product 
and operating procedures, Vitasoy does not generate 
a significant volume of hazardous waste apart from 
small amounts of lubricating oil and laboratory waste 
which are collected by specialised waste contractors 
and disposed of at regulated hazardous waste 
disposal facilities. In 2019/20, we formed a solid 
waste management working group and developed a 
waste management roadmap.

OUR SUPPLIERS
AppendixAs producers of plant-based food and beverages, the 
source and quality of the edible raw materials used 
as the ingredients of our products have a substantial 
impact on our business. The success of our business 
is heavily reliant on securing a steady supply of quality 
soybeans, tea leaves, and other plant-based ingredients. 
The materiality assessment and stakeholder feedback 
have identified “responsible sourcing of raw materials” 
as one of the top material issues which have a significant 
impact on our business. We are aware that as the 
potential for climate-related emergencies escalates, 
our suppliers are at risk of bearing the negative 
impacts of unstable and extreme weather conditions, 
water scarcity, and soil degradation. Mindful of the 
environmental challenges that confront our supply 
chain, we must also be vigilant to manage possible 
social and ethical pitfalls. It is vital for Vitasoy to work 
together with our supply chain partners in an open and 
collaborative manner to share our values of sustainable 
and responsible sourcing and ethical business. 
Supply Chain Management 
Vitasoy continues to exercise due diligence to ensure 
we engage with suppliers who share our sustainability 
vision, adopt sound sustainable practices, and 
demonstrate strong ESG performance, whenever 
possible. In line with our Supplier Responsibility 
Principles, we proactively seek out suppliers whose 
practices have been certified by recognised authorities such as the FSC, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm 
Oil (RSPO), and the ProTerra Foundation. In support of 
the local economies where we operate and to minimise 
the impacts of transportation on the environment, we 
prefer to work with local suppliers when appropriate. 
In 2019/20, 100% of the soybeans we used to 
manufacture product in Mainland China were sourced 
in the country. 
Through our responsible procurement initiative, 
we have secured commitments to our Supplier 
Responsibility Principles from 98% of our direct 
material suppliers. To facilitate the identification, 
assessment, and prioritisation of sustainability risks 
within our supply chain, we are in the midst of a supply 
chain sustainability risk assessment. This step will be 
followed by a self-assessment questionnaire to verify 
supplier performance and identify potential areas for 
further improvement which will be applied to direct 
material suppliers. Currently, we are piloting the self-
assessment questionnaire with some of our major 
suppliers. 
Sustainable Farming 
Guidelines 
In support of sustainable agricultural practices, Vitasoy 
has developed Sustainable Farming Guidelines as part 
of our effort in responsible procurement. The guidelines incorporated our experience in 
sustainable and organic farming practices in our 
Australian contract farms. The guidelines stipulate 
requirements on the control of relevant farming 
practices including the proper management of 
fertiliser, land, water, waste, energy usage, greenhouse 
gas emissions, pest, weed and disease, biodiversity, 
social aspects, and the supplier’s own value chain. 
While many of these practices have already been 
implemented in our Australian contract farms, we are 
piloting the guidelines with two selected contract farms 
in Mainland China. The results from this pilot will be 
analysed as we look to expand these guidelines to our 
contract farms across the entire Group in the future. 
For more details on our procurement and supplier related 
policies, such as our Group Responsible Procurement 
Policy and Sustainable Farming Guidelines, please visit

EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT AND WELL-BEING
AppendixRegular engagements with our employees help 
us to stay connected with their needs and keep 
the channels of communication open. Employees 
are updated on the Company’s latest business 
developments and strategies through a variety of 
channels such as staff newsletters and townhall 
meetings. We want our employees to know that 
we are listening to their opinions. To encourage 
more two-way communication and collect staff  
feedback, we organise regular engagement surveys, 
employee forums, and staff briefings. Moreover, we 
are fully committed to the physical well-being of our 
workforce and have organised an Employee Wellness 
Series of recreational activities which included yoga, 
mindfulness, body exercises and a Chinese Medicine 
Wellness Enhancement Talk.
Vitasoy Success Drivers (VSD)
Rooted in Vitasoy’s vision and mission, the 
VSDs are our Core Competency Model in which 
the expectations for employee behaviour and

DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION
AppendixDiversity and Inclusion is integral to our success. 
It helps us gain insight by maximising the power of 
diverse thinking and fosters more creative problem-
solving, open mindedness and collaboration. To 
cultivate these behaviours at work, Vitasoy’s 
management team led by example and developed 
our diversity agenda. Part of our diversity agenda 
is to progressively build a more gender balanced 
management team. 
A key part of this shift is to expand our understanding 
of diversity and inclusion, and enhance employees’ 
awareness across our operations by developing 
various human resources policies to ensure that our 
labour practices are in line with local or international 
standards and requirements. We are reviewing 
management processes to address different aspects 
under the Group Fair Labour Practices Policy , against 
international best practice. These aspects include, 
but not limited to, diversity and inclusion, and anti-
discrimination and harassment. These standards and 
requirements include stipulations in our policies and 
Employee Handbook which cover equal opportunity, 
anti-discrimination, anti-harassment, employee 
health and safety, ethical business practices and 
grievance procedure. We take great care to provide 
an equal opportunity working environment free from 
harassment or discrimination.We have developed policies which require all our 
subsidiaries and joint ventures to have aligned equal 
opportunity principles in all aspects of employment 
including hiring, training and development, 
performance management, compensation and 
benefits and employment termination. Our Group 
Fair Labour Practices Policy  was established to 
uphold human rights across our operations through 
the promotion of diversity and equal opportunity, 
the prohibition of discriminatory practices, and the 
prohibition of the use of child and all forms of forced 
labour. For more details on our policies, please visit

Guidelines 
As part of Vitasoy’s responsible procurement approach, 
we continue to support sustainable agricultural 
practices through the newly implemented Sustainable 
Farming Guidelines. The Guidelines require suppliers 
to respect and comply with all national and local 
legislations applicable to their businesses. This 
includes, but is not limited to, corporate governance, 
anti-corruption practices, agricultural standards, 
labour standards, environmental protection, and 
health and safety standards. 
To ensure a clear understanding of the Guidelines, 
sustainable and responsible sourcing is clearly defined
