2020 Report
The data presented in this report covers all manufacturing and 
production facilities within Lear’s operational control for calendar year 2020. We have disclosed our material topics in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, wherever feasible. Please refer to the Appendix for more information. 
Lear has historically reported our ESG performance and progress 
on an annual basis. Periodic updates are incorporated to ensure the content remains current. We plan to release our next fully refreshed report in 2022.
Environmental,
Social and Governance (ESG) at Lear

Most of us are happy to see 2020 in the rearview mirror. It was a tough year. While    
the pandemic, racial inequality and climate change continue to be significant concerns, we see hope on the horizon.
COVID-19 may have slowed our operations, but our resilient employees battled back. 
We developed, implemented and shared our Safe Work Playbook to help everyone return to work safely. Working remotely, wearing masks, social distancing and sanitizing are now normal. We are still open for business. 
As the pandemic enters its second year, the prolonged separation from families and 
coworkers is taking its toll. We boosted our wellness and mental health efforts to help employees deal with the sudden and lasting change. Similarly, our employees identified food insecurity as an issue in their communities and responded with donations through our Operation GIVE campaign and local charities around the world. We are adapting and have emerged stronger, together.
Following a summer of unrest, declarations about racial equality flourished. But words alone don’t solve issues. Strategies  do. We pledged $1 million and launched the T ogether We Belong campaign to educate employees, drive and fund our diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts. As a responsible corporate citizen, we will do our part to help end racial inequality.
Our planet contains finite resources we all share. T o reduce our impact on the environment, we set aggressive carbon 
reduction goals that we intend to achieve by 2030, including using 100% renewable energy for electricity and a 50% reduction in carbon emissions at our manufacturing facilities. We aspire to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. We are also leading the way in developing sustainable, safe and smart solutions for future mobility. For example, this year Lear will provide content to further vehicle electrification for 18 customers and more than 90 vehicle models. 
Lear cannot tackle the world’s toughest problems alone. We are continuing our commitment as a signatory to the United 
Nations (UN) Global Compact, the largest corporate sustainability initiative in the world. We are also working with our suppliers to champion human rights, confirm responsible sourcing and conserve natural resources. We plan to complete third-party human rights and sustainability assessments with 100% of our more than 3,000
  production suppliers by the 
end of 2022.
All of this is possible because we are inventive, inclusive and get results the right way. Our talented employees are the 
best in the business. They know there is no dichotomy between doing well and doing good. The same trends driving the evolution of the automotive industry are good for employees, customers, investors, consumers, suppliers and society. That is why, every day, we are striving for better by Making every drive better™. 
Sincerely,
Message from Our CEO

6 Lear 2020 Sustainability Report2019  December MarchA new coronavirus 
appeared in China.
Lear re-issued our existing cover-cough and wash hands outreach materials to our global sites. Our team in China leveraged our Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG) OH-06 Pandemic Preparedness and Response consensus document. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency on January 30.
The virus was officially named COVID-19. China mandated face masks for all citizens. COVID-19 cases surpassed 100,000 globally. 
The CDC recommended limiting gatherings to no more than 50 people. By mid-March, non-essential travel was banned, automotive production halted and nationwide quarantines took effect around the world.
The WHO made the assessment that COVID-19 
could be characterized as a pandemic.
From the beginning of the lockdowns, a  global 
team of 30 leaders assessed and tracked our supply chain’s readiness to restart operations. Daily reports identified levels of production for Lear and our customers, the number of employees who tested positive or were quarantined, available PPE and global government actions around the world. 
Everyone who could work from home did.
All U.S. employees received full healthcare benefit coverage regardless of their pay or 
work status, including COVID-19 testing. Lear shared the AIAG OH-06 Pandemic 
Preparedness and Response consensus document with all sites globally. 
We issued and tracked implementation of a 
COVID-19 Safety Directive. 
Our engineers in North Carolina designed face 
masks produced in the Dominican Republic for employees working in China—all in just 72 hours. 
2020 January - FebruaryLEAR’S RESPONSE GLOBAL EVENTS
 COVID-19 cases surpassed 1 million globally.
We wrote and shared the Safe Work Playbook with practical guidelines for setting 
up a pandemic prevention team, cleaning and disinfection procedures, staggering shifts, conducting on-site health screenings, and communicating with and training employees to return to work.
When work started, we conducted surveys, asking employees whether they received 
PPE, if their work area had enough sanitizer, if they felt safe, and how Lear was doing. Based on 76,888 survey responses, feedback was 91% positive. Some employees felt safer at work than visiting the local grocery store.
T o reduce expenses, our Board of Directors accepted a 25% reduction in retainer 
fees, salaried employees in the United States and Canada agreed to a temporary 20% pay deferral, our CEO took a 10% pay cut, and other named executive officers’ salaries were reduced 5%.
T o further protect jobs, company contributions to employee retirement funds and 
salary increases were temporarily suspended.April
7 Lear 2020 Sustainability Report• 
September - NovemberEconomies fell into recession as unemployment 
surged. 
Cases in the United States hit new records, and 
Hong Kong shut down schools, bracing for a third wave of infections. 
Universities re-opened with online classes, and 
athletes played in empty stadiums.
May - AugustLEAR’S RESPONSE GLOBAL EVENTS
Lear employees produced more than 10 million masks to protect employees and healthcare workers from COVID-19. 
In Mexico, our plants donated N95 masks to a regional 
hospital and Tyvek® full-body protection suits to Red Cross first responders. In Poland and Romania, employees sewed and donated 15,000 masks for their communities. In the Philippines, our electronics hardware development team retrofitted portable countertop ovens with shortwave ultraviolet (UV-C) lights to sterilize masks for hospitals. And in the United States, Lear donated 20,000 masks to Goodwill Industries of Greater Detroit.We piloted thermal cameras and a mobile app-based contact tracing solution. Many employees continued to work remotely.
Robotics and artificial intelligence increased social 
distancing and sanitation throughout the production process, protecting employees from possible pandemics and other health issues in the future.
We surveyed workers at our world headquarters in 
Southfield, Michigan, to measure interest in long-term remote work arrangements. About 200 employees transitioned to permanent remote work, allowing for incremental real estate consolidations and overhead cost savings.
Lear continued to monitor remote employee 
work opportunities.We launched an online Cognitive Behavioral Therapy program and increased mental health and well-being efforts globally to help employees as we entered the second year of the pandemic.
Lear assembled a cross-functional leadership 
working group to study vaccine distribution options globally and determine next steps in supporting those in Lear’s global workforce who choose to      be vaccinated.
Lear leadership worked with the government and 
other groups to help identify ways to increase 
voluntary vaccination rates.
We kicked off salaried employee surveys and focus 
groups to understand how workplace flexibility will impact Lear’s ability to attract and retain employees. Lear’s vaccine work group surveyed U.S. employees and developed an educational campaign.
We launched a Remote Onboarding 
process to ensure new employees are safely and successfully welcomedto Lear’s global team and set up for long-term success in a remote work environment.New cases spiked to new highs, resurging in Europe and the United States. Some countries imposed new lockdowns.
Multiple vaccines were approved.

same. This involves not only strong internal governance, 
but also taking action to support the communities in which 
we operate both by giving back and by taking a stand on 
important social issues like human rights and racial equality.”

The energy industry is changing rapidly. As the industry matures, terminology 
will change. Regulations will change. Customer and public expectations will change. And new innovations will likely advance our course. 
“While no one can predict the future, one thing is certain: no single company can 
reach its climate change goals alone,” said Jack Nunes, Vice President, Global Environmental, Health and Safety.  “Just as our customers rely on us to do our part, we will ask our suppliers – and the industry at large – to collaborate with us.”
Lear already works with industry partners and meets regularly with our customers 
on climate change issues. There are many great ideas. Innovation will make them financially feasible. For example, Lear is working with automakers to develop sustainable packaging for the products we provide. The project involves suppliers, employees, union members and customers, united in their focus on sustainability. A Collaborative Effort

BE INVENTIVEInnovative Technologies
Exciting transformations are reshaping the automotive industry—and 
they’re accelerating. In the very near future, we anticipate greater availability and acceptance of EVs—and a cleaner, more sustainable 
future for everyone.
Why is Lear so optimistic? Automakers and suppliers continue to 
invest heavily in batteries, motors, integrated power modules, and other hybrid and EV technologies. Production plants dedicated to EVs are being built. Iconic brands are being revived or expanded to offer electric models. And financial commitments of tens of billions of dollars have been announced. These are signs of confidence in propriety technologies, a prepared supply chain, and growing, permanent consumer demand.
Breakthroughs in connectivity and electrification will mobilize the 
auto industry in new ways, such as autonomous driving, shared mobility and transportation as a service (T aaS). Lear is laser-focused on supporting a faster transition by integrating sustainability into our product development strategies and processes. We have a proven 
track record and a portfolio of technologies ready now.
Lear Innovation Ventures (LIV) is accelerating the pace 
of innovation and collaboration around autonomous, connected, electrified and shared mobility trends. LIV is investing in advanced development teams, partnerships and early-stage technologies by working with venture capital firms, accelerators and incubators.Lear Innovation Ventures

Driving Electrification
For consumers, the adoption of EVs largely depends on driving range and 
charging time. When EVs can match the longer road trips and quick fuel-ups of today’s internal combustion engine, the advantages of cleaner air, energy efficiency, lower maintenance and quiet transportation will make EVs the popular choice. While battery companies are improving cell design and chemistries, Lear is improving integrated power modules and battery management systems to maximize electric driving range, speed up charging times and deliver the highest power density solutions in the industry. 
Without the need for engines, transmissions and other traditional powertrain 
components, EVs can be designed around people instead of machinery, opening doors to radical redesigns of the passenger cabin. Lear’s ConfigurE+ seating system, which begins production this year, requires a flat-load floor often seen in electrified vehicles. The technology not only allows second- and third-row seats to be removed, repositioned and rotated to nearly any configuration but offers heating or cooling, power recline and charging ports for devices. With virtually limitless configurations, the system will support autonomous driving, ridesharing and T aaS—helping propel EVs to new dimensions in mobility.

Defending the World’s Forests
Forests are the answer to many climate change challenges. They support biodiversity, 
reduce temperatures, filter rainwater and remove carbon dioxide from the air.
What do forests have to do with an automotive supplier? After all, cars are not made out 
of wood. But some of our raw materials—such as leather sourced as a by-product of the food industry—may have an indirect impact on forests. Practices that deplete or degrade forests and peatlands—for example, clear-cutting trees to increase grazing land—have a negative environmental impact on land, water, biodiversity, indigenous communities and our climate.
Lear is committed to working with our suppliers and customers to protect forests by 
eliminating deforestation and forest degradation. Our No Deforestation Policy aligns with industry standards to ensure: 
• Supply chain transparency, so that all materials supplied to Lear are from                  
legal sources 
• Land is not clear-cut or burned for production or development 
• Compliance with governmental law, regulations and guidelines regarding deforestation 
Lear and our suppliers work within credible, landscape-level frameworks where they exist. T o ensure our suppliers comply with these requirements, Lear may conduct audits or require third-party verification. According to the UN Food and Agriculture 
Organization, deforestation accounts for nearly 11% of GHG emissions.
100% of Lear’s Brazilian leather suppliers 
use geofencing to ensure they don’t buy 
animals from farms involved in deforestation, invasion of indigenous and protected areas, or human rights violations.

Improving Air Quality
According to NASA, the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the 
atmosphere has increased more than 48% since the Industrial Revolution. Carbon emissions are considered the most important long-lived driver of climate change. T o meet our aggressive Climate Change Goals, we are working to reduce energy generated from non-renewable fuel sources, invest in renewable energy and, as a result, decrease GHG emissions.  
Reducing Energy Use
Lear’s continuous improvement teams use lean manufacturing processes to identify energy and waste reduction projects, track progress and share best practices. Their efforts are reducing energy use around the world.Adding Transparency 
to Our Results
Due to the global pandemic, activities in our operations around the world were reduced. As a result, our emissions, energy use, water use and waste generation also decreased. 
T o provide transparency, we are reporting our absolute results as 
well as results based on hours worked. We continued to reduce energy and water use, cut emissions and decrease waste, even accounting for the impact of lower production during the pandemic.
31 Lear 2020 Sustainability ReportNearly
Investing in Renewable Energy
Lear aims to use 100% renewable energy—such as solar, geothermal, 
and wind—for electric power consumed at our manufacturing facilities by 2030. With less than a decade to meet this climate change goal, we are developing a roadmap with milestones to help us reach or destination: a carbon neutral future. 
We already consume renewable energy within our manufacturing 
operations, and some plants draw energy from power grids with 50% or more renewable content. Beginning in 2021, we will proactively invest in renewable energy through on-site renewables and/or direct, retail and virtual power purchase agreements (PPA). Our investments will continue every year until we achieve our goal. At the same time, Lear intends to help finance global renewable energy infrastructures to serve the world’s population and protect our planet.
Decreasing GHG Emissions
Greenhouse gases (GHG)—such as CO2—trap heat and warm the planet. 
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat and transportation is the largest source of GHG emissions from human activity. By 2030, we aspire to reduce GHG emissions from electricity used at our manufacturing facilities by 50%.
Lear participates in two data collection efforts to measure our progress: • All plants report their GHG emissions. The data is collected through a 
third-party software data platform on a monthly basis and reviewed by                   our corporate EHS team. The data is used to track, analyze and develop plans to reduce our GHG footprint. 
• Lear participates in CDP supply chain and investor surveys to report our performance to customers and investors, and assess our performance,   risks and opportunities related to GHG emissions.

Protecting Our Water
With water scarcity quickly becoming one of the greatest threats to the economy and 
environment, it’s no wonder that many corporations identify water management as a material risk.
According to the World Resource Institute (WRI), water scarcity, floods, droughts, and other 
water risks can cause operational and supplier disruptions, higher operational costs, brand damage and heightened regulatory uncertainty.
Using the WRI Aqueduct T ool, Lear completed a water risk assessment of all facilities in 
2019, assessing water withdrawals, consumption, quality and site-specific regulatory risks as well as calculating baseline water stress (the ratio of total annual water withdrawals to total available renewable supply). 
We are creating a comprehensive water risk management strategy on a region-and site-
specific basis and plan to announce our future water reduction goals in an upcoming sustainability report.

community around the world. T o ensure diverse leadership, we require interviewing a diverse slate of candidates for all roles of manager and above. In our corporate office and U.S. plants, Lear works with the National Society of Black Engineers, National Black MBA Association, Women of Color Conference and the Society of Women Engineers to help fill our pipeline with diverse talent. We also support these groups through internships, externships, conference participation and sponsorships.
Equal Pay, Equal Opportunities,  
Equal Rewards
Each year, our Global Compensation group leads a comprehensive review 
of pay equity at Lear, including base pay, reward programs and promotions. In the 2020 Pay Equity Study, our review of 19,448
  salaried employees 
revealed less than 1.5%   of women required an adjustment to their base pay 
to achieve pay equity. In addition, the study reported that Lear consistently provides equitable promotion opportunities to men and women.
Developing Diverse Leadership
We expanded our Leadership Development Program for minority employees to inspire career growth and help prepare them for the nextlevel in their careers. Known as Leads Self, the program offers three training modules that include leadership webinars, reading groups, strength assessments, self-development tools and an introduction to Lear’s Leadership Scorecard.

Together We Win
Our plants and hourly workforce are at the core of our success. 
We believe the best way to deliver the highest quality products and services is to maintain a work environment that prioritizes safety and fosters collaboration, inclusion, respect and excellence. 
Launched in 2017, T ogether We Win is a global employee 
engagement program focused on driving cultural change in our operations. Plants advance through four levels—leadership, work environment, employee involvement and team empowerment. T ogether We Win unites hourly employees across the globe in achieving excellence based on key operations and employee engagement metrics such as quality, absenteeism, health and safety performance, and operational efficiency. 
T o help our plants along the journey, our propriety playbook 
provides a roadmap of best practices, and engagement surveys give hourly employees a voice in measuring progress at each plant. T ogether We Win is how we achieve our outstanding reputation—not only for operational excellence—but as a great place to work. Employee

Global Engagement Surveys
Every year, we survey hourly manufacturing employees around the world during 
T ogether We Win events. The festive atmosphere typically includes ribbon-cuttings, appearances by executive leadership and other activities. Conducted entirely online or by mobile phone, the anonymous and confidential survey covers 22 questions evaluating relationships between employees and plant leadership, employee recognition, retention, health and safety, motivation and respect in the workplace. 
Many plants conduct follow-up pulse surveys using our online employee engagement 
hub. The tool helps plant leaders prepare and launch the questionnaire, analyze results, develop action plans, assign tasks to team members and track the plant’s status in the T ogether We Win Scorecard. In addition, global teams share feedback and photos, collaborate on projects and track their progress.
We Wrote the Playbook
Based on T ogether We Win principles, Lear developed a playbook to train plant managers and employees to transform plant culture. Known as Playbook Plays, it includes helpful and comprehensive guidelines on a variety of topics such as hosting ergonomics awareness training, team leader talks and implementing lunch and learns. Playbook Plays was the foundation for the 80-page Safe Work Playbook, developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lear shared the document with the world, and it has been downloaded more than 35,000 times.

Champions of Lear
Ask any employee about Lear and you’ll hear terms like team mindset, 
collaboration, opportunity and pride—again and again. We’ve worked hard to nurture an inclusive culture, where ideas are valued and efforts are recognized. 
The Champions of Lear program celebrates our global operations 
and our hourly and salaried employees who represent the best-of-the-best in our company. Individuals, teams or plants can submit an application to be reviewed by a diverse panel of judges that includes Lear leadership. Award categories honor achievements in culture, customer appreciation, innovation, supply chain, quality, safety, operational excellence, continuous improvement, sustainability, best launch and best plant collaboration, as well as the prestigious CEO Special Appreciation Award. In 2021, an additional award category will be added to recognize initiatives that support DEI in the workplace. When possible, winners are announced at an annual celebration at Lear’s headquarters in Southfield, Michigan. 
We are very proud of every team’s accomplishments and congratulate 
this year’s winners.
WATCH       as the 2020 Champions of Lear are revealed! When China mandated all citizens wear face masks in 
February, they were soon in short supply. Our engineers in Mocksville, North Carolina, designed masks made in the Dominican Republic for employees working in China—all in just 72 hours. At our manufacturing facility in Pine Grove, Pennsylvania, two semi-automatic production machines were installed to make 1 million masks per week, kicking off an exceptional global endeavor that produced more than 10 million masks in only four months. While we supported our employees, helping our local communities is also in our DNA. As a result, Lear also donated masks to first responders in local communities. 2020 CEO Special

GLOBAL
Aiding Those in Need 
During the Pandemic
STORIES FROM AROUND THE GLOBE
• As annual events were cancelled and volunteer opportunities 
diminished, charities refocused to creatively meet new needs. Lear was quick to help. At Forgotten Harvest, where Dave McNulty, Vice President, Global Seating, Human Resources, is a board member, Lear’s contribution to the Healthy Food, Healthy Kids program helped provide 307,890 meals for kids impacted by unanticipated school closures. Our $50,000 matching donation to the “Hunger Free in the D” radio telethon helped raise $700,000 for Detroit’s Capuchin Soup Kitchen and Gleaners Food Bank to provide 2.3 million meals for the hungry. 
• When the Pope Francis Center’s Annual Gala was cancelled, our sponsorship dollars were redirected to fund emergency relief efforts for food and supplies. Our sponsorship of the College for Creative Studies Student Exhibition Opening was repurposed to support safe return to campus preparations and meet immediate and evolving student needs. As the weather allowed for more outdoor activities, Lear contributed additional operating funds to Chandler Park Conservancy (CPC) to address mental and physical health while maintaining social distancing. In addition to coordinating COVID-19 testing, the CPC offered participants information on how to stay safe and connect to resources. 
• In Michigan, Lear donated 147 used laptops to Cornerstone Schools to enable students to continue their education in manufacturing, construction and IT curriculums at home.           Some communities relied on printing paper lessons during the pandemic. In the Philippines, employees joined the company in Pledge for Education, which raised funds to donate four new printers, ink and 108 reams of paper to two elementary schools serving 1,400 students in the mountains of Cebu.

Feeding the Hungry
BRAZIL & PHILIPPINES
When employees in Brazil noticed city residents mobilizing to cook and distribute meals to truck drivers during the pandemic, they joined the effort, distributing water bottles, providing tables and organizing volunteers to benefit about 200 truck drivers. In partnership with United Way Brazil, Lear purchased and distributed over 800 food packages to eight institutions including kindergartens, nursing homes and an Afro-Brazilian quilombola community. In the Philippines, employees responded to the local government’s call to help quarantined residents with powdered milk donations.

Supporting Victims of 
Domestic Violence
GERMANY
Lear employees in Oberding-Schwaig donated 
money and supplies to Diakonisches Werk Freising to support victims of domestic and sexual violence. The COVID-19 pandemic has added pressure to already distressed families due to financial issues, home schooling and office conditions, dramatically increasing cases of domestic violence. The Lear donation will support children and teens.

Attracting New Talent
We take an active approach to attracting the best talent. Instead of 
relying on staffing agencies and applicants to come to us, we “push” for candidates using external websites such as LinkedIn as well as our intranet. Lear also uses talent mapping to understand “who’s who” in certain fields. For every senior manager position and above, we aim to have a diverse slate of candidates by gender and ethnicity.
T o ensure a pipeline of talent, we encourage candidates to launch 
their careers at Lear through a number of creative programs. While many were postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic, most programs have been contributing to our talent pool for many years, and we are eager to restart them as soon as practical.
57 Lear 2020 Sustainability ReportRemote Onboarding
Much has changed this past year, including how businesses interview, hire and onboard new employees in a world of remote work. Even as immunizations increase, health and safety restrictions are relaxed and a new normal is realized, it’s clear that many people across all industries will continue to work remotely. 
In 2021, Lear is launching a new onboarding process that engages current employees 
from senior leadership to peer groups to help ease the integration of newcomers to the company. No longer limiting the onboarding process to Human Resources but including Lear staffs from cross-functional teams and ERGs will ensure that the missed in-person interactions will be replaced with meaningful remote connections. Quarterly welcome calls with our CEO, assigning work buddies, and adding the newcomers to group projects will be prioritized as we welcome new hires, navigate those critical first few months and set employees up for long-term success. 

Student Innovation Challenge
University students majoring in engineering and business compete for internships 
at Lear through our Student Innovation Challenge. T o ensure diversity of thought, candidates submit a personal statement and take a personality assessment. During the initial two-day jumpstart, students tour our headquarters, learn about innovation techniques and Lear’s capabilities, receive a real-world challenge and brainstorm solutions. The teams then have two weeks to work with Lear coaches on a solution and business case, which they present to our executives. The winning team is offered a summer internship in our innovation department to develop their idea. At the end of the summer, the team reports their progress to our technical leaders and executives. The successful program has expanded to Europe and Asia.

One Lear Mindset
By expanding our focus from local facilities to the global organization, 
One Lear encourages employees to proactively communicate, collaborate, build relationships, create diverse teams and give back to communities across the world. Our Leadership Model
We believe great leaders create great cultures; great cultures attract and retain the best talent; and the best talent wins in the marketplace. Lear provides a number of development programs and opportunities to help leaders at all levels of the organization build their strengths and grow. These programs are based on the three aspects of our Leadership Model: 
Get Results the Right Way
There are many ways to get results. By working as a team, understand -
ing our customers’ needs, showing respect, empowering others, making sound and timely decisions, focusing on long-term goals instead of short-term gains, and investing in our talent for the future, we Get Results the Right Way. 
Lead with Integrity
Integrity drives us to do the right thing, deliver what we promise and own our decisions. Solid leaders are also humble, confident and actively recognize other team members for their contributions. They can disagree without being disagreeable.
The Leadership Model was introduced in 2014 and has been globally translated, institutionalized and integrated into performance management and leadership reviews. It is also one of the criteria for our talent acquisition process and part of our onboarding program.
61 Lear 2020 Sustainability Report
Leadership Development Opportunities
Employees at all levels are invited to build their strengths and grow in their 
careers with these opportunities:
Leads Self
In 2020, we launched Leads Self Lite, a self-guided career development program,    to inspire career ownership and growth. Piloted with members of our valuable ERGs , participants received training to increase professional confidence, build 
their network, understand their strengths and know what it means to be a good leader at Lear. They became aware of where they are today, where they want to be tomorrow, and how to get there. Lear plans to expand the program in 2021.

Work-Life Balance
In today’s hectic world, balancing work and family can be difficult. Lear offers 
creative ways to help our team members achieve a healthy work-life balance. These opportunities vary by location, depending on what makes sense culturally and competitively. Educational Programs
We offer tuition reimbursement and apprenticeship programs for all education levels across the globe. For example, in Mexico, Lear offers private classes to any Lear employee who wants to complete a high school education certificate, and we celebrate their accomplishment with a graduation ceremony. Hourly employees can also prepare to become a team leader through T eam Leaders in Action. Lear is proud of the upward mobility these programs provide to our employees. Many of our hourly employees have progressed from the shop floor to positions of leadership, including plant manager.

Driving Wellness
In 2020, our facilities in Europe and Africa launched Driving Wellness, a campaign to 
promote healthier lifestyles and boost morale during the pandemic. The campaign addresses four aspects of well-being: body, mind, nutrition and balance. Here are some examples of how our teams in the United Kingdom are Driving Wellness.In France, employees flex their muscles during twice-a-week muscle 
strengthening sessions online. In Poland and the United Kingdom, employees join 30-minute mindfulness meditation sessions run by a professional coach to support mental health. “In this period when we are working longer and harder from home, it is extremely important that we take care of our own mental health and clear our mind frequently,” said Nicky Burmester, Vice President, Human Resources, Europe and Africa.
Body
T eams joined the 23-mile Three Peaks Challenge, scaling the highest 
peaks of Scotland, England and Wales while raising money for two local charities. Others completed the 26-mile Mighty Hike through the Wye Valley to get fit while supporting Macmillan Cancer Support. Although they did not win, our Coventry team took on the Wasps Rugby team to raise funds for Zoe’s Place Baby Hospice. 
Mind
Sixteen employees from throughout the country were trained as mental health first aiders to offer support, listen and provide self-help guides or support directories to those experiencing stress, anxiety, depression or emotional difficulties. Activities during World Mental Health Day helped raise awareness and remove the stigma around mental health issues. Employees were also encouraged to team up with coworkers for Quiz Time or T ea and T alk sessions to promote team bonding. 
Nutrition
During Move to Smooth Day, employees pedaled a smoothie bike to run a blender and make their favorite smoothies. Working with the popular weight loss program Slimming World, the cafeteria team offered new lunch choices and caloric information for grab-and-go options. Pop Up Chefs served noodles and omelets with fresh, local ingredients. 
Balance
Employees donated home-baked desserts for the Macmillan Cancer Support Coffee Morning event. T o reduce waste and balance the envi-ronment, employees paid a 20 pence cup tax for using disposable cups. T o support the vulnerable in their community, employees established a food hub run by volunteers based on a “give what you can, take what you need” philosophy.

Labor Relations
Our talented teams are pros at just-in-time manufacturing 
and product management with a well-earned reputation for excellence. Collaboration and teamwork are central to our culture. Through T ogether We Win, union and nonunion employees work collaboratively to improve efficiency, safety and quality every day. We share ideas, best practices and solutions across plants, regions and the globe.
As champions of human rights and fair labor practices, we 
respect our employees’ right to freedom of association and satisfy all labor laws and regulations. Responsibility for labor relations begins with senior leadership and continues to the site level where we meet regularly with bargaining representatives to discuss topics critical to our shared success. 
Common labor discussion topics include safety, working 
conditions, employee engagement results, the state of the industry and new business awards, business transfer plans, performance relative to targets, implementation of technology in support of Industry 4.0, regional labor requests, and labor and management issue resolution, among others. These forums also provide opportunities for employees to report issues and concerns. 
Self-Directed Work Teams
In cooperation with our labor union partners, Lear has established Self-Directed Work T eams at six sites around the globe. The autonomous work environment concept allows employees with different skills to work together with minimal managerial supervision. With team members rotating positions to perform all the jobs of the team, work becomes less task-oriented and more multi-dimensional. T eam members improve their own work processes, collaborate with other departments, set goals and manage performance. A fundamental rethinking and redesign of business processes, Self-Directed Work T eams help provide clear strategy alignment throughout all levels of the organization and have resulted in increased employee ownership and engagement, process improvements, innovation, achievement of key operating objectives, and job satisfaction.
~82,500employees globally are 
covered by labor agreements

Human Rights
We believe the best way to deliver the highest quality products and services is to maintain a work environment 
that fosters collaboration, interaction, tolerance and respect. As champions of human rights, we strengthened our Human Rights Policy to clearly define how we approach, govern and defend the dignity of people throughout our operations, the communities in which we operate, and our global supply chain. 
Our policy is guided by the UN Global Compact, its T en Principles and Sustainable Development Goals, 
as well as the 1998 ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Under our policy, we:Through Lear’s Compliance and Ethics Hotline, 
employees, suppliers and business partners can anonymously report concerns in their language via a toll-free phone call, email, online website or regular mail. In addition, we monitor our operations, partners and suppliers for potential violations and act if violations occur, up to and including termination of employment or contract.Reporting Concerns
Respect Privacy
We respect the privacy of individuals, including employees and customers. 
We follow globally recognized privacy principles and implement reasonable and appropriate practices in our collection, use and sharing of personal information about individuals. 
Encourage Workforce Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion
We provide all employees with a professional work environment, free from 
discrimination and harassment. As described in our Equal Employment Opportunity Policy, fair and equal employment opportunity is offered to every person. All hiring, compensation and promotion decisions are based on qualifications, performance, skills and experience. 
Prohibit Child Labor, Forced Labor and 
Human Trafficking
We prohibit child labor in any of our facilities worldwide and meet all applicable 
laws regarding minimum employment age where we conduct business. We do not use forced or involuntary labor of any kind, including prison labor, indentured labor, bonded labor, military labor, modern forms of slavery and any form of human trafficking. 
Treat Employees with Dignity and Respect
As described in our Harassment Free Workplace Policy, we do not tolerate harassment, discrimination, workplace violence, or physically, mentally or emotionally abusive disciplinary practices. We take appropriate corrective action to any unacceptable treatment or retaliation. Provide Fair Pay, Hours, Benefits and 
Working Conditions
We comply with all applicable wage and hour laws, including equal pay, 
minimum wage, overtime, maximum hour rules, meal and rest periods, as well as legally mandated benefits. Where local industry standards exceed applicable legal requirements, Lear pays fair wages and ensures working conditions that are competitive with the higher local industry standards. We employ ethical recruitment practices, provide a safe and healthy work environment, and shared our Safe Work Playbook to help businesses and government return to work safely during the pandemic.
Allow Freedom of Association and 
Collective Bargaining
We respect our employees’ right to form, join or not to join a labor union 
without fear of reprisal, intimidation or harassment. Where employees are represented by a legally recognized union, we are committed to establishing a constructive dialogue with their freely chosen representatives and bargaining with them in good faith. As stated in our Supplier Sustainability Policy, we expect our suppliers to respect their employees’ right to freedom of association. 
Source Responsibly
We ensure that materials used in our products do not directly or indirectly provide funding to conflicts or human rights abuses. We endeavor to use only components with raw materials where extraction, transport, trade, processing and export are obtained from validated sources as a matter of principle, wherever practicable. We also look beyond our direct supply chain to ensure appropriate sourcing measures, including the sourcing of the raw materials used in our products.

Our global Potential Product Issue Resolution Process (PPIRP) identifies critical issues that impact the performance of a salable product. In the event that any team member has a concern with a potential product performance issue, our process requires that a PPIRP be initiated. Using the PPIRP portal on Lear’s intranet, employees can log in and create, view or modify issues depending on access level. Appropriate quality, engineering and other cross-functional resources are then assigned to review and address the concern. An automatic escalation mechanism is built into the process in the event issues are not addressed in a timely manner. Significant concerns are directed to Lear’s Global Product Compliance and Safety Committees for review and appropriate action.Chemical Risk Management

As the automotive industry evolves, ESG issues have become even more 
significant, not only for Lear but for our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders. Consistent with our vision of Making every drive better™, we work to ensure that our passion for our business is also channeled into creating possibilities for a better world. 
As part of our ESG initiatives, we are committed to safety in our workplaces, 
sustainability in our operations and products, and supporting our people in the communities where we do business. We expect our more than 3,000 production suppliers to share our commitment to corporate responsibility    and ethical conduct.
Our commitment to ESG, operational excellence and transparency is 
monitored by our Board of Directors through the Nominating and CorporateGovernance Committee and senior leadership. T o better integrate sustainability throughout our enterprise, Lear has added specific ESG responsibilities to senior management across global functions. In addition, Lear has also established processes requiring formal sustainability considerations within  our product strategies, including design and content.
Our ESG efforts are supported by a talent management strategy focused 
on leadership development, employee engagement and the continuous improvement of our EHS management systems, as well as programs and operations to enhance performance and teamwork.

Executive Compensation
T o support long-term value creation, our strong pay-for-performance 
philosophy aligns our executive compensation programs with theCompany’s business strategy and shareholders’ interests. It is also essential to our ability to attract, retain and motivate individuals who can achieve 
superior financial results. 
80 Lear 2020 Sustainability Report97%of stockholders supported our executive compensation program and practices in 2020
Align with Our Business Strategy
Our incentive plan performance measures are aligned with our business 
strategy, correlate with stockholder return and are generally consistent with our peers. A significant majority of the total compensation earned by our named executive officers consists of variable or performance-based compensation programs, such as annual and long-term incentive plans. Our executive compensation programs:
Include a High Percentage of Performance-Based Pay
All of the annual incentives and 60% of the long-term incentives offered to our named executive officers in 2020 were determined based on the achievement of specific performance measures.
Offer a Balanced Mix of Performance Measures
Multiple financial performance measures and stock price based awards, such as stock options and total shareholder return, are assessed over one- and three-year periods. Incorporate Robust Stock Ownership Rules
Management stock ownership guidelines are applicable to all executive officers, including our named executive officers. The stock ownership guideline for our CEO is six times his annual base salary.
Require Equity Retention 
Until an executive satisfies the applicable stock ownership guidelines, he or she must hold 50% of the net shares acquired upon the vesting of equity awards.Include Holding Periods for Career Shares
As part of our long-term incentive package, the CEO and certain executives traditionally receive awards of time-based career shares. The units underlying the career shares must be held until the earlier of age 62 or three years after retirement. In 2020, rather than receiving time-based career shares, the CEO and certain executives received performance-based career shares, which are 100% performance-based and consist of equally weighted performance goals of total liquidity, backlog and relative total shareholder return. Distribution terms are consistent with prior awards.
Recover Excess Compensation with a 
Clawback Provision 
If we are required to prepare an accounting restatement due to any current or 
former executive officer’s intentional misconduct, we will recover any excess incentive compensation.
Are Reviewed Annually 
Every year, we perform a risk assessment, compare key elements of our exec -
utive compensation programs with market practices and emerging trends, and consider our business strategy and talent needs. Our Compensation Committee also engages an independent compensation consultant. 
Lear prohibits officers and directors from hedging transactions involving 
company stock or pledging company stock as collateral for loans. None of the employment agreements with our executive officers contains an excise tax gross-up provision.
Upon a change in control, all equity awards are subject to “double-trigger” vesting, 
which protects our employees and helps ensure an orderly leadership transition. In addition, our executives are not eligible to receive severance benefits solely upon a change in control. This is intended to ensure that members of senior management are not influenced by their personal situations but are able to maintain objectivity in evaluating a potential change in control transaction. 
Corporate Governance
Board Structure
Elected by our shareholders and led by an independent, non-executive chairman, Lear’s Board of 
Directors provides guidance, helps develop and implement our strategic plan, manages risk and builds long-term shareholder value. All directors are independent, except our president and chief executive officer. The duties of our directors are stated in our Corporate Governance Guidelines.
T o promote the interests of our shareholders, the Board has adopted governance structures and 
policies, including:
• Annual election of directors
• Majority voting standard with a director resignation policy for uncontested elections
• Robust stock ownership guidelines
• Annual Board and committee self-evaluations
The Board and its committees meet throughout the year to provide strategic leadership and 
guidance to the management team. Our Board has three standing committees.

Risk Management
Using our Enterprise Risk Management Process, our Board of Directors and 
senior leadership identify, assess and manage key risks that may impact our ability to achieve our strategic objectives. Lear’s management continually monitors the material risks facing the company and works with risk owners to identify and implement mitigating actions. With the assistance of its Committees, the Board of Directors oversees management actions by: 
• Evaluating management reports and inquiring into areas of                  
particular interest
• Reviewing material strategic, operational, financial, compensation, compliance and ESG risks 
• Considering specific risk topics in connection with strategic                  planning and other matters
• Directing risk oversight and related activities conducted by Board Committees through reports of the Committee chairmen to the Board 
86 Lear 2020 Sustainability Report
Stakeholder Engagement
Invested in our industry and our company’s success, Lear’s stakeholders 
include our employees, global supply partners, customers, local communities, investors and analysts, industry associations, academia, and government and non-government organizations (NGOs). 
In addition to presenting our business strategy and ESG efforts, we reach 
out to these groups regularly to collaborate, share best practices, garner feedback, partner and grow. T ogether, we are working on the issues that matter most to society, the environment and the future of mobility.
Investor Engagement
Members of Lear’s senior management team engage with investors regularly through conferences, small group meetings and one-on-one meetings. In 2020, our management team held Corporate Governance Roadshows for current and potential investors to highlight Lear’s ESG activities. 
Political Contributions and Lobbying
Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics prohibits making any political contributions in the name of the company or using Lear funds, assets, services or facilities without the approval of our Board of Directors. We have not made any political contributions in the past five years. 
Lear does not have a political action committee (PAC) and has not 
engaged any third parties to perform political lobbying activities on our behalf. However, we are members of trade associations that may engage in advocacy efforts on behalf of the automotive industry or automotive suppliers in general.

Data and Cybersecurity
In the past two decades, cybersecurity has become a billion-dollar 
business for professional criminals. Just recently, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) warned businesses specifically about the threat of high-impact ransomware attacks, while daily headlines herald massive losses for unwary and unprepared corporations across all industries. 
For years, Lear has been working to combat these global threats, 
building two teams dedicated to product and enterprise cybersecurity, respectively. Both work in collaboration and report to our Board of Directors at least annually. The Audit Committee of the Board is responsible for both product and enterprise cybersecurity oversight.

Secure Products
Vehicles are becoming more connected and complex than ever. While 
connectivity brings great benefits to consumers and manufacturers, it also brings certain risks, such as the potential for hackers to infiltrate critical vehicle systems. 
Lear has diligently invested in product security as well as the necessary 
processes and people involved in making our products. For example, sophisticated cybersecurity technology protects Lear’s vehicle gateway modules, which make up the electronic heart of a vehicle’s network architecture. We also design security into our components to protect our components’ platform and network connections. We work with our customers to ensure security specifications are appropriate for the application.
Lear’s world-class in-house cybersecurity experts are directly involved in 
the design of components and overall systems. Located in four locations around the world and supported by engineering teams with security expertise, our product security team provides governance and supports all security aspects of product development for electronic modules, including interfaces with cloud communication, smartphones and the production plant. 
We work directly with our customers and Lear’s product development 
teams over the entire development life cycle, from developing requests for quotation through project execution. The team performs threat analysis and risk assessments, defines security requirements, develops guidance and code hygiene, supports security on the production line and completes security testing. 
As further evidence of Lear’s commitment to securing the driving 
experience, we offer security monitoring throughout the life of the vehicle. This premium service assesses risks and recommends mitigation for newly discovered vulnerabilities and can utilize automated tools to scan vehicle software to avoid vulnerabilities in the first place.“For each customer program, 
we have a designated 
cybersecurity manager who 
ensures the engineering team 
follows our cybersecurity 
process, utilizes the appropriate 
tools to recognize any problems 
and fixes all issues before 
production can start. Several 
gate reviews are deployed along 
the development cycle to find 
and fix security issues early. This 
strategy enjoys the support of 
top executive management.”
DR. ANDRE WEIMERSKIRCH
Vice President, Cybersecurity and Functional Safety
91 Lear 2020 Sustainability Report
92 Lear 2020 Sustainability ReportRecently, we evaluated our cybersecurity efforts using the criteria developed by 
the Automotive Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Auto-ISAC). Among automotive supplier peers, Lear was rated above average in development life cycle, threat monitoring, training, risk management, governance, collaboration with third parties and incident response. Lear’s approach establishes:
• Security protocols integrated throughout the product development life cycle
• Baseline security levels that we recommend following in all our programs, 
regardless of our customers’ requirements 
� Four gate reviews to confirm products satisfy security requirements
• ISO 21434 compliance (expected 2021)
• Regular mandatory global awareness training and technical security training
• In-house cybersecurity to protect our platformsLear’s award-winning, cloud-based Xevo MarketTM

With final publication expected in the first half of 2021, 
the new ISO 21434 vehicle cybersecurity standard will apply to electronic systems, components and software as well as any external connectivity. The standard has been structured similar to ISO 26262, which covers functional safety, and will provide developers with a  comprehensive set of process requirements for implementing security safeguards that span the entire development life cycle and supply chain. Dr. Andre Weimerskirch, Vice President, Cybersecurity and Functional Safety at Lear, is one of 18 members of the American SAE working group helping to develop the standard.

Secure Enterprise
T o help ensure the integrity and security of the products Lear builds as well as the 
confidential information we maintain related to our employees, customers and products, Lear has established a sophisticated enterprise security program. While our product security team maintains the cybersecurity of our products, the enterprise security program safeguards the security of everything that goes into building the product—from developer workstations to applications that run the assembly line. 
Most successful cyberattacks stem from human deception. Criminals seek to 
steal login credentials, internal data, trade secrets and personal information. Ransomware attacks can damage systems and halt operations, causing costly and impactful damage to production and reputation. Security awareness, along with a solid technology strategy, is business critical. 
Our enterprise security strategy focuses on fortifying our people, processes and 
technology. We align our processes with ISO 27001 global security standards, collaborate with internal and external partners, and conduct assessments, audits and penetration tests. We are investing in our staff certifications, training and communications. Our industry-leading suite of technology is supplemented with constant market analysis for new capabilities and rationalization of our technology based on utilization, alignment and inter-operability.“Securing our enterprise depends 
on every employee’s top-of-mind 
security awareness just as much as it 
depends on Lear’s firewalls, antivirus 
and other defensive technologies. 
The prevention of cyberattacks isn’t 
an IT thing—it’s an everyone thing.”
EARL DUBY
Vice President and Chief Information Security Officer
94 Lear 2020 Sustainability Report
People are our frontline defense. Our Security Awareness and T raining Program 
teaches employees to spot potential cyberattacks and report suspicions. Interactive lessons and educational videos address specific cybersecurity issues, equipping employees with the education necessary to maintain top-of-mind security awareness. T opics included the Internet of Things, social engineering, email security, working remotely, privacy and social networking.
Lear’s enterprise security team is geographically dispersed, with more than 35 
employees across seven countries on four continents. The team is supported by Managed Security Service Providers (MSSP), offering both incident response and technology support. This team has obtained industry-leading security certifications, managed large global incident response activities, and is constantly trained on new tools, techniques and procedures.

Supplier Sustainability
One of Lear’s core competencies is managing our complex global supply
chain of more than 3,000 production suppliers. We work hard to carefullyselect our suppliers and develop long-term collaborative relationships for our mutual success. We continuously evaluate supplier quality, delivery and price, as well as supplier governance, human rights and sustainable business practices. Now we are taking the next steps, as discussed in the following pages. 
“Supporting supplier sustainability is 
good for the entire value chain, from 
the economic health of our company, 
customers and investors to protecting 
the rights of the many employees 
who work at Lear and throughout 
the supply chain to the families, 
consumers and local economies that 
depend on us.”

Assessing & Monitoring ESG Risks 
in the Supply Chain
Recently, Lear engaged NQC Ltd., a global third-party supply chainsustainability management firm, to map, assess and monitor direct and extended supply chain risks related to ESG, including human rights. Launched in Q4 2020, the program will be rolled out globally in 2021. 
Lear worked with internal and external stakeholders to develop a 
questionnaire to identify and address industry-specific sustainability risks. We will supplement this by engaging the supply base directly for on-site reviews as needed once borders are open and travel is permissible. 
Over time, Lear’s suppliers will be scored based on the quality of theirsustainable business practices. The cumulative scores will help us build a supply 
chain map that will allow Lear to more appropriately identify and prioritize resources toward our most salient risks. We intend to share qualitative and quantitative data in an upcoming sustainability report.
Suppliers that do not achieve a satisfactory score will be required to take remedial 
actions, potentially including on-site surveillance by Lear or our designate. We will do everything in our power to ascertain and correct the situation through education, increased on-site monitoring and impact assessments with individual workers. With guidance from international standards and global advocates for protecting human rights, such as the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Danish Institute for Human Rights, Lear will identify best practices and tools to resolve concerns.  While our preference is to remedy potential issues with existing suppliers, Lear reserves the right to cancel contracts and switch to a compliant vendor when appropriate remedies cannot be achieved.

Responsible Sourcing
Conflict Minerals
A variety of minerals—such as tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold (also known as 3TG)—
are raw materials in certain products from both our Seating and E-Systems businesses. We work to prevent the use of components where the extraction, transport, trade, processing and export of raw materials are obtained from sources where regulations and controls are not validated. For example, Lear:
• Requires suppliers to perform due diligence of their own supply chains and report  
the content of the parts they provide to Lear 
• Discloses the use of conflict materials originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries each year
• Uses an active mapping process to ensure we are driving toward conflict-free sourcing of all materials used in our products
• Follows the five-step Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas framework from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)• Participates in industry-driven programs, such as the Responsible Minerals Initiative, which validate industry-wide control systems and transparency, including chain of custody    and traceability systems
• Benchmarks our efforts via the AIAG, cross-industry collaboration groups and benchmarking firms such as the Responsible Sourcing Network (RSN). Lear compares favorably to peers and the industry in general.
• Conducts continual product material assessments to identify risks beyond conflict minerals (3TG) and has begun assessments and supplier outreach on other critical minerals, such as cobalt

Farm to Factory: Responsibly 
Sourced Automotive Leather
The luxurious leather covering the seats in vehicles around the world is not 
only comfortable but sustainable. The value chain begins with cattle raised to provide beef for the food industry. As a by-product, hides are upcycled for leather manufacturing and diverted from landfills. 
Lear Eagle Ottawa hand selects premium hides from suppliers in Argentina, 
Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Spain, the United States and Uruguay. Sourced from a 98% Leather Working Group (LWG) certified supply base and assessed annually by the Business Benchmark on Farm Animal Welfare (BBFAW), our supply chain is required to follow recognized animal welfare guidelines to provide comfortable living conditions, nutritious food, clean water and low stress environments for cattle. 
Lear’s supply chain logs incoming raw materials, tracing hides back to 
processing centers, feed yards or ranches where the animals were raised. Regular audits and annual assessments are conducted at our direct suppliers’ facilities, including traceability audits from third-party auditors such as LWG. In addition, the food industry adopted BBFAW rating criteria to evaluate farms’ animal management policies and performance.We expect our extended supply chain to implement              
industry-best policies and practices for the ethical 
treatment of animals, including the Five Freedoms for Animals: 
1. Freedom from hunger and thirst 
2. Freedom from discomfort 
3. Freedom from pain, injury and disease 
4. Freedom to express normal behavior 
5. Freedom from fear and distress
Employees and our supplier partners can 
anonymously report concerns in theirlanguage via a toll-free phone call, email, online website or regular mail. Ethical Treatment
of Animals
100%of Lear’s Brazilian leather suppliers use geofencing to ensure they don’t buy animals from farms involved in deforestation, invasion of indigenous and protected areas, or human rights violations.
98%of our global crust volume is LWG rated, and we expect to achieve 100% by 2022. 100%of leather suppliers processing hides originating in Brazil are LWG gold or silver rated.

We work to prevent the use of components 
where the extraction, transport, trade, processing and export of raw materials are obtained from invalidated sources. 
For example, Lear:•  Requires suppliers to perform due diligence of 
their own supply chains and report the content of the parts they provide to Lear.
•  Discloses the use of conflict materials 
originating in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo and adjoining countries each year.Number of recalls issued,  total

validation and implements quality systems that contribute to the safety of our products.

•  Follows the five-step Due Diligence Guidance 
for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals 
from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas framework from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
Risk Mitigation and Business Continuity
Along with maintaining strong supplier relationships, Lear uses several supply chain best practices to help identify and mitigate risks, such as human rights, labor, and health and safety deficiencies, fires and natural disasters, environmental concerns, supplier disruptions, breaches in business ethics and others.
Lear sources components from multiple 
geographical locations which helps ensure materials and components are available in the event of a regional or global crisis.  Our purchased commodity strategies call for dual validation of interchangeable parts when possible, further protecting Lear’s supply chain in the event of a supplier disruption.
Lear uses an advanced inventory modeling 
process, which considers multiple supply       chain risk factors and ensures that adequate safety stock of material is in place through the supply chain.
