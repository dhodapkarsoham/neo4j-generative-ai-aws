The BMW  Group Sustainable Value Report ( SVR) has been 
published to provide stakeholders with comprehensive infor -
mation about the company’s sustainability strategy and the 
progress made in integrating sustainability into its corporate 
processes. The Sustainable Value Report is published at the 
same time as the Annual Report on the date of the Annual 
Accounts Press Conference.
The requirements of the German CSR Directive Implementa -
tion Act ( CSR RUG ) obligate Bayerische Motoren Werke Ak -
tiengesellschaft ( BMW AG) to publish a non-financial  state -
ment at company and Group level. This will be published 
jointly as an integrated,  separate non-financial  report (here -
inafter referred to as “separate  non-financial  report”) within 
this Sustainable Value Report for BMW  AG and BMW  Group.
In the SVR 2018  we focused, above all, on providing informa -
tion that is required in order to comply with the German 
CSR Directive Implementation Act and the GRI Standards. 
We then added more detailed information on topics with 
strategic relevance for the BMW  Group. Current examples on 
measures that support implementing our sustainability tar -
gets can be found on  • our website .
Each chapter starts with a one-page overview of key per -
formance indicators. The sub-sections of each chapter begin 
with an overview of the information required to comply with 
the relevant legislation. Further topics of strategic relevance 
to the BMW  Group and information pertaining to the GRI 
Standards, beyond the legal reporting requirements, are out -
lined in more detail on the subsequent pages.

Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AGPreface  
Dear readers,
Sustainable operations are becoming an increasingly deci -
sive factor for the future of any business. Our claim: with 
our products and services we are a part of the solution. This means that we are shaping the future of mobility. In this way we create value for our company and society. This is true for Germany and all the countries we are  
active in.
Electrification and innovations
For us as carmakers, climate protection is particularly relevant.
 We ha

goal is emission-free mobility. With its sustainable 360- 
degree approach, our BMW  i3 was a pioneer in electric 
mobility.
Today, we are the European market leaders in electric ve -
hicles. In 2018 , we delivered more than 140,000 electric 
vehicles and plug-in hybrids worldwide. We are electrify -

Efficient supply chain
We also make sure that we keep our environmental foot -
print as small as possible in our manufacturing processes. 
In Europe, we are already using electricity generated 
 e
xclusively from renewable sources. By 2020  we want all 
our plants worldwide to run on green electricity. 
In addition, we are continuously optimising our value 
chain. By signing the BMW  G roup Code on Human Rights 
and Working Conditions, we have made a clear statement. It focuses on equality, diversity, safety in the workplace and the protection of personal data. We also have our  
suppliers and sales partners commit to this code.

n this way we are improving the quality of urban life. It

We are already implementing this collaborative approach by entering into partnerships in many areas. These range from our membership in the UN Global Compact and partnerships along the supply chain to product develop -
ment alliances with new tech players. 
The 
2018  Sustainable Value Report shows once again that 
we make an invaluable contribution to our customers’ 
mobility and act for the common good and that we will
 c
ontinue to do so going forward. With innovations, 
courage and tenacity.
For me, our Sustainable Value Report is not just a look 
back on what we have achieved already. It also provides a vision for our future – with clear objectives and meas

2  Since 09/2018 all vehicles in the EU must be licensed according to the new WLTP test cycle. However, the calculation of CO 2 emissions from fleet vehicles will only be switched to WLTP in 2021 by the European 
Commission. Therefore, it is necessary to calculate WLTP fleet emissions back to NEDC values up to and including 2020 for reporting purposes. The changed WLTP test constraints lead to higher NEDC emissions 
(NEDC correlated) due to the reversed calculations. In order to ensure comparability, the CO 2 fleet emissions for 2017 (122 g/km NEDC) were converted to a correlated NEDC value of 128 g/km under WLTP test 
constraints and published originally with the 2/2018 quarterly report.

Appendix·
The BMW  Group is currently undergoing a fundamental 
transformation process that presents both opportunities 
and risks for the business. While in the past they were 
purely hardware products, automobiles are now becoming 
part of an interconnected mobility world. This is not a 
 linear process. The new worlds of mobility develop at 
 different  speeds, sometimes  in parallel  and sometimes 
they build on one another.  We expect a significantly  trans -
formed and more complex future that will also make it 
possible to achieve the same degree of mobility with fewer 
cars and thus to increase the quality of life in our cities.As part of the transformation process the BMW  Group 
value chain will also undergo profound changes over the 
coming years. The driving concepts in this process are: 
“Automated”,  “Connected”,  “Electrified”  and “Shared  and 
services”  (ACES ). Building on our expertise as carmakers, 
the BMW  Group is looking in particular at the opportun -
ities arising in the areas of “Smart vehicle & digital services”,  
“Vehicle as a service” and “Mobility  as a service”.Service  
Carmakers offer their customers vehicles 
to buy outright or via financing and leasing options.
Customer
 
The customer wants to own a car in order to 
be completely mobile in all situations (family, job).Service
 
Mobility service providers deliver comprehensive mobility solutions across different means of transport and tailored to individual needs. They  bundle and act as agents for mobility solutions 
and services to provide a comprehensive range 
of products and services.
Customer
 
The customer is provided with mobility solu -
tions for all situations under one roof, in order  
to reach the intended destination and does not 
need to arrange and organise these solutions him- or herself.Service
 
The vehicle is becoming a smart device, with added value from software- and data-based functionality, real-time applications and  services (connected, seamlessly integrated).
Customer
 
The customer expects smart functionality 
and services in and around the integration of the vehicle into his or her digital environment. The new personalised and automated experi
-
ence also leads to new  possible uses.Service  
Fleet operators provide mobility solutions via 
car-  / ride-sharing and carpooling services.

SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY
OUR  MISSION
The BMW  Group is the world’s most successful and sus -
tainable premium provider of individual mobility.
In order to maintain our position in future, we consistently 
integrate sustainability into our business model. We see 
global challenges like climate change or urbanisation as 
opportunities for the development of innovative products 
and services. Sustainability thus secures our economic suc -
cess on a long-term basis. Our innovations are not only  
developed  to enhance  the benefits for our customers  – we 
also want them to have a positive impact on society and 
the  environment.
Taking social and environmental responsibility for all we 
do is an integral part of how we perceive ourselves as a 
company. We are convinced that the lasting economic suc -
cess of any enterprise in today’s world comes down to act -
ing responsibly and ensuring social acceptance. We achieve 
a clear competitive  advantage  with efficient  and resource-  
friendly production processes and state-of-the-art solutions for sustainable individual mobility for our customers. For 
this reason, sustainability is a key component of our corpo
-

ucts through to the development of new lines of busi -
ness.  • GRI  102 -11
Pursuing long-term sustainability goals
To pursue our mission to be the most successful and most 
sustainable premium provider of individual mobility, the 
BMW  Group set out ten strategic goals in 2012 . We con -
sistently  follow these goals, which have been defined 
through to 2020 . Our focus is on three key areas of ac -
tion:
– Products and services
– Production and value creation
– Employees and society

In addition to pursuing our ten long-term goals, we con -
tinuously address sustainability topics in the current pub -
lic discourse and discuss our points of view on these is -
sues with the stakeholders. These include, for example, 
the diesel debate, discussions on critical issues of the sup -
ply chain or the global regulation of CO 2 and contam -
inants, as well as the definition  of favourable  framework  
conditions for electromobility.
Our next steps:
In order to keep pursuing our existing activities with the 
same consistency while also allowing for external develop -
ments – in particular the increasing demands due to regu -
latory requirements, the capital market and civil society – 
we began reviewing our sustainability strategy in 2018 . The 
full details of the updated strategy are to be revealed in 
2019 .
The updated sustainability strategy is based on the materi -
ality analysis conducted in 2018 . It consists of the following 
six key topics: mobility solutions, decarbonisation, environ -
mental and social standards in the supplier network, circu -
lar economy, employees and culture as well as responsibili -
ty and partnerships. Once again, we have set ourselves stra -
tegic sustainability goals in these key areas, which will 
extend through to 2030 .12

For the second step, BMW  Group conducted an internal 
workshop with experts on sustainability and strategy de -
velopment in order to discuss the outcomes of the stake -
holder dialogues. As a result, we updated the list of key 
 issues from a corporate perspective. Inspired by the feed -
back from the stakeholders that we needed to narrow 
down our focus, we downgraded the importance of several 
issues in which the ecological, social and economic impact 
of the BMW  Group is limited. • GRI  102 -46
The outcome of this process was an updated list of 15 key 
issues for the BMW  Group. These include issues that were 
classified  as highly relevant  both by stakeholders  and by 
the company  and which involve significant  opportunities 
for the BMW  Group to work towards sustainable develop -
ment. For the purpose of concentrating our sustainability 
activities and communication with even more emphasis 
on relevant,  overall areas of action, we defined six clusters 
in the workshop mentioned above, which channel the  
responsibilities of the BMW  Group for environment and 
society. Our 15 high-materiality issues are included with -
in these.  • GRI  102 -47 • see  
graphic 1.03Defining fundamental sustainability issues
In order to identify in good time which topics may bring op -
portunities and risks to our business, today or in the future, 
and to focus our activities accordingly, we observe external 
trends on an ongoing basis using an “environmental  radar”. 
This means keeping track of the public discourse and the 
political agenda, such as the World Climate Conference and 
the goals set out by the United Nations for sustainable de -
velopment, the • Sustainable  Development Goals ( SDG s). Feed -
back from our stakeholders during BMW  Group dia -
logue meetings also helps us to always stay informed 
about the most important trends and expectations with 
regard to sustainability.
We also carry out a materiality analysis at regular intervals 
in order to identify essential issues. This forms the basis for 
the definition  of our priority areas and for the content of

In the year under review, we undertook a fundamental re -
vision of our 2015 materiality  analysis.  The first step was to 
hold stakeholder interviews, which are also a component of 
our strategy revision. Altogether, we interviewed 20 repre -
sentatives  of different  interest groups about the key issues 
that were included in our materiality matrix in 2015 . These 
stakeholders included scientists, capital market partici -
pants, affiliates  in our supply chain, members  of generation  
Y (15–25 year-olds), representatives of relevant NGO s and 
politicians as well as experts in sustainability from other 
companies. The BMW  Group asked stakeholders for an 
assessment of the relevance of the selected issues as well 
as an overall evaluation of the materiality matrix from the 
year 2015 . 
The results were very informative. Although stakeholders 
viewed the majority of the issues as important on an indi -
vidual basis, a common response among the general feed -
back was that BMW  Group should concentrate more 
strongly on fewer, particularly relevant topics and that the significance  of the key issues for the 
SDG s could still be 
spelled out more clearly. • GRI  102 -43, 102 -44, 102 -4613

Contributing to the achievement of the  
Sustainable Development Goals
In autumn 2015 , the General Assembly of the United Na -
tions announced the • Sustainable  Development Goals ( SDG s). 
The SDG s are at the core of the 2030  Agenda, a global 
action plan with the aim of shaping economic progress 
in an environmentally compatible manner and in accord -
ance with social equity.  • G
• see  
graphic 1.02We are convinced that companies, governments and other 
organisations can make a positive contribution towards 
the attainment of the SDG s. We also believe that it is our 
duty to uphold this social contract. We too are committed 
to supporting the goals formulated within it as part of our 
sustainability strategy and with a focus on our value chain. 
For us, this also means factoring in the 2 °C target set out 
in the Paris climate agreement.
Developing positive impacts on the economy and society
As a global company, the BMW  Group acknowledges its 
responsibility to contribute to social prosperity wher  ever 
we are active. For this reason, our mission is not only to 
aspire to continuous improvement in our own value cre -
ation, but also to make specific contributions  towards 
economic development and quality of life at our loca -
tions. 
Lasting profitable  growth of the BMW  Group not only 
facilitates a reasonable return for investors, but also at -
tractive salaries for employees, as well as our contribu -
tion to society through income tax payments. These are direct economic  effects which are quantified  by calculat
-
ing the net value added.
The net value added of the BMW  Group is at a consist -
ently high level of € 24,746 million ( 2017: € 24,977 mil-
lion1). The largest share of our net value added benefits 
our employees ( 2018 : 50.4%, 2017 : 48.2%1). The propor -
tion applied to providers  of finance declined  to 9.2% com -
pared to the previous  year. For the government / public  
sector (including deferred tax expense), this amounted to 
11.2%. The proportion of net value added applied to share -
holders, at 9.3%, was lower than in the previous year.

2 Expenditure for material and supplies covers both the original material costs of the vehicle production as well as additional material costs (for example, tariffs, insurances and freight). 
The BMW  Group currently employs 134,682 people ( 2017 :

tions worldwide ( 2017: 4,750). Our purchase of inter  mediate 
products also secures jobs worldwide in our supply chains. 
As we source the main components for vehicle produc -

lion in income taxes in 2018  (2017 : €2,00001 million). In 
addition, we are helping to fund public budgets by paying 
tariffs and import duties.

Case study: South Carolina / USA
An impact assessment study by the University of South Carolina in 2018 
shows that the BMW  Group made an appreciable economic impact on the 
prosperity of the US federal state of South Carolina. The overall contribution to economic output was estimated at US$ 21 bil-
lion, achieved by the generation of jobs, contributions to local household 
incomes and the impact on the gross domestic product of the state. Thus, 
the BMW  Group creates considerable economic multiplier effects in 
South Carolina. The study in San Luis Potosi / MX delivered equally posi -
tive results.
 
 
BMW Group’s position on the 
 recommendations of the Task Force on 
 Climate-related Financial Disclosures
The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) was 
created by the  • Financial Stability Board  in order to define volun -
tary, standardised disclosures on climate-related financial risks. In 
summer 2017 , the Task Force published recommendations for trans -
parent business reporting on climate risks and opportunities in the con-
text of business and financial reporting, which focus on four core areas: 
corporate management, strategy, risk management and key perform -
ance indicators and targets.
Climate change is one of the greatest social challenges of our time. With 
our range of efficient combustion engines, electric and hybrid drives as 
well as integrated mobility services, we are continuously reducing the 
CO2 emissions and pollutant outputs of our vehicles. Likewise, we are 
lowering CO2 emissions across the locations of the BMW Group by im-   proving resource efficiency and expanding the use of renewable energy 
sources. 
We share the opinion that the disclosure of relevant sustainability in -
formation by companies and financial establishments should be en -
couraged. For this reason, we already report in detail on corporate 
management, strategy and risk management with regard to climate 
change issues, as well as the relevant key performance indicators and 
targets, which are published in our business and sustainability report 
(Sustainable Value Report) as well as in the CDP ratings.
The TCFD recommendations were integrated into the reworked CDP 
questionnaire during the revision that was carried out in 2018. In ac -
cordance with the CDP evaluation scale, based on detailed and exten -
sive answers to the questionnaire and compliance with the four core  
areas of the TCFD, the BMW Group received the appropriate score for 
inclusion in the A-list. On the basis of the reputation assessment, 
which represents a part of the CDP Ratings, the company was placed 
in the category Leadership with an overall assessment of A-.

SUSTAINABILITY 
MANAGEMENT
The BMW  Group manages its business in accordance 
with responsible corporate governance principles geared 
to sustainable value creation in all areas of the company. 
To ensure compliance with these principles across all div -
isions of the company, we have defined clear guidelines 
and responsibilities. These are supported by control and 
incentive systems.
Involving the Board in sustainability management
The Board of Management governs the BMW  Group under 
its own responsibility, acting in the interests of the com -
pany and with the aim of achieving sustainable growth in 
value. It determines the strategic orientation of the enter -
prise and ensures its implementation. The Board of Man -
agement is also responsible for ensuring compliance with 
all provisions of the law and internal regulations as well as 
for adequate risk management and controlling. The Super -
visory Board advises and supervises the Board of Manage -
ment in conducting its duties (dual management system). 
• GRI  102 -18
Sustainability is a component of our corporate strategy. 
For this reason, our Sustainability and Environmental 
Protection department has been directly under the man -
date of the Chairman of the Board of Management since 
2007 . This unit is responsible for sustainability strategy 
and sustainability management worldwide. Its tasks in -
clude the following:–  To identify challenges and opportunities for  sustainable operations
–  To develop and monitor sustainability goals
–  To further develop, specify and integrate our  sustainability initiatives into individual divisions, 
 taking the entire value chain into account
–  To ensure the cooperation of all departments in the 
company involved in sustainability
–  To plan environmental protection activities  (Group representative) and manage the environmental 
protection network
–  To manage global centres of competence on a range of environmental issues
Managing sustainability on a long-term basis
The Sustainability Board makes decisions on the long-
term alignment of the sustainability-related areas of ac -
tion included in Strategy NUMBER  ONE  > NEXT . The 
entire Board of Management is represented on the Sus -
tainability Board, along with the heads of Sustainability 
and Environmental Protection and of Corporate Commu -
nications. The Sustainability Board convenes at least once 
a year to assess the company’s progress on economic, 
envir  onmental and social issues as well as the degree to 
which sustainability principles have been integrated into 
the various divisions. The decisions of the Sustainability 
Board are prepared in the so-called Structure Circle. It 
consists of departmental managers within the enterprise 
and convenes at least twice a year with the explicit pur -
pose of discussing sustainability issues. To discuss these 
topics, the so-called Structure Circle brings together the 
head of Sustainability and Environmental Protection as 
well as the head of Governmental  and External  Affairs. 
The BMW  Group management principles are also set 
down in the • Corpo rate Governance Code . • GRI  102 -18, 102 -19, 102 -20,

Rewarding sustainable business success
The Supervisory Board decides on the level of compensa -
tion received by members of the Board of Management, 
orienting its decisions on the sustainable development of 
the BMW  Group. Bonuses are also based in part on per -
sonal performance, evaluated primarily according to quali -
tative criteria. These criteria include environmental inno -
vation (e.g. reduction of carbon emissions), leadership ac -
complishments and the ability to lead change processes. 
Additional criteria are: enhancing the company’s attract -
iveness as an employer, progress in the implementation of 
the diversity concept, which is presented to the Supervis -
ory Board in a report, as well as activities that advance cor -
porate citizenship in the BMW  Group • Remuneration report

Operating as a sustainable participant in the  
financial market
In March 2018  the European Union Commission presented 
its “Sustainable Finance” action plan for the financing of sus -
tainable  growth, which specified  the contents  of proposals  
for legally binding regulations in May  2018 . With the pro -
posed regulation  for a European  Union classification  system 
(“taxonomy”),  standardised  criteria are to be established  to 
determine whether the economic activity of an enterprise is 
(environmentally) sustainable, for the purpose of promoting 
the transition of the economy in the European Union to a 
more environmentally friendly and sustainable circular 
economy. From the BMW  Group’s perspective, these devel -
opments cannot be permitted to result in disproportionate 
disadvantages for European companies in the face of inter -
national competition. 
A regular, in-depth dialogue with the capital market has al -
ways been regarded as a high priority for the BMW  Group. 
Investors and analysts are giving increasing consideration to 
environmental, social and governance ( ESG) aspects in their 
investment recommendations and decisions.
Through face-to-face meetings and telephone calls, as well 
as roadshows  and conferences  held at international  finan -
cial centres,  we inform members  of the financial  commu -Organisation of sustainability in the BMW Group

Sustainability established as corporate objective
Sustainability  has been integrated  “top-down”  at all corpor-
ate levels of the BMW  Group since 2009  as a strategic ob -
jective based on specific targets and key performance  indi-
cators. Sustainability is therefore an explicit component of 
the company’s management system. On the one hand, this 
means that every major issue and project must be measur -
able in terms of sustainability as a corporate objective. 
This way, we ensure that, in addition to economic factors, 
environmental and social aspects are also accounted for in 
the decision-making process. It also means that sustain -
ability as a corporate objective is broken down to the level 
of business areas and divisions. As a result, the personal 
targets set for managers include sustainability aspects and 
criteria which are also taken into account for their per -
form  ance-based remuneration. • GRI  102 -19, 102 -28• G18

Sustainability is a factor that the BMW  Group also takes 
into consideration for investments. The company regularly 
examines compliance with sustainability standards during 
the process of allocation of asset management mandates. 
The BMW  pension fund is already selectively invested in 
assets with a targeted ESG  focus.
Capital market ratings for sustainability
The consistent integration of sustainability is evidenced by 
the fact that, among other things, the BMW  Group is listed 
in numerous sustainability indices and ratings.

STAKEHOLDER DIALOGUE
As a globally active enterprise, the BMW  Group operates in 
a sensitive, highly connected environment. Our produc -
tion and our products have an impact on the environment 
and affect the interests of our diverse stakeholders. At the  
same time, the viewpoints, decisions and actions of our 
stakeholders have a decisive impact on the success of our 
enterprise. The BMW  Group therefore engages in ongoing 
dialogue regarding sustainability topics with its stakehold -
ers in relevant markets and at all its locations.
In dialogue with our stakeholders, we want to build trust, 
understand positions, identify trends as well as build on 
and consolidate partnerships. In doing so, we also deliber -
ately address critical issues and debates. This helps us to 
analyse more effectively  what next steps are required  or 
are expected of us in the individual areas of action in sus -
tainability management. At the same time, by engaging in 
dialogue, we can show in a transparent manner what scope 
we see for action when confronted with current challenges 
and the prerequisites and framework conditions that are 
important to us. All of our stakeholder dialogue formats 
follow the same basic principle. The feedback from our 
stakeholders is integrated into the strategic deliberations of 
the company. • GRI  102 -44
Our • Stakeholder Engagement Policy  forms the basis for  con- 
tinuous  dialogue.  It defines the goals of the dialogue,   
determines the criteria for identifying and prioritising our 
stakeholders and provides a template for a range of suit -
able dialogue formats and communication channels.   
• GRI  102 -42Continuous  and systematic  identification  and prioritisation  
of relevant stakeholders and their topics of interest is a cor -
nerstone of stakeholder dialogue. To this end, we regularly 
carry out “stakeholder  mapping”  on strategically  important  
topics at all relevant locations.
Our next steps:
The BMW  Group plans to continue to engage in dialogue 
with our stakeholders next year, both regionally and glob -
ally. In addition to ongoing dialogue, we apply our estab -
lished formats in order to meet the need of our stakehold -
ers to discuss current topics.
As in the previous years, we plan to hold stakeholder dia -
logues in 2019  in our most important core markets: Europe, 
Asia and North America. In accordance with our goal of 
 effecting  a sustainable  change in mobility  patterns  in 
 metropolitan regions, we will continue our dialogue on 
“digitalisation”  and “urban mobility”  in order to gain new 
perspectives in these areas.
Likewise, we also want to continue to engage in dialogue 
with our investors. Apart from our daily communication 
with investors and analysts, we plan to participate in 
 Socially Responsible Investment ( SRI) roadshows and con -
ferences in the global financial  centres in 2019  again.• see

Other strategically relevant topics
Transforming urban mobility
Traffic jams, high levels of air pollution  and associated  re-
strictions on quality of life present enormous challenges, 
particularly in regional conurbations. We discuss these 
problems and possible solutions at our dialogue meet -
ings with our stakeholders around the world. Increasing 
numbers of participants have expressed their expecta -
tions that companies should take responsibility for the transformation of urban mobility. Through our Centre of 
Competence for Urban Mobility, we are also involved in 
ongoing in-depth communication with cities and munici -
palities.
Particularly in our four 
BMW Group Technology  Offices 
in Mountain  View/US,  Shanghai/CN,  Tokyo/JP  and Seoul/
KR, we develop new approaches for sustainable mobility. 
Proximity to the technological hotspots of the world facili -
tates exchange with important stakeholders in order to  
develop innovations and technologies for urban transform -
ation. The challenges and needs determined on this basis are then channelled  into specific research  projects.
Promoting ACES  topics
Decarbonisation and digitalisation are currently in the 
spotlight of political and social debate. With our focus on 
the strategic  innovation  fields “Automated  Driving”,  
“Connectivity”,  “Electrification”  and “Shared  and Services” 
(ACES ), we are paving the way for the development of 
lower- carbon, more efficient  mobility.  We also presented 
our solutions at our stakeholder dialogue meetings in 
2018. The participants  confirmed that  innovations  in auto-
mated driving and the provision of innovative mobility 
services should be prioritised in future development.• see  
chapter 2.3In addition to the creation of corresponding ACES  products, 
supportive framework conditions are also crucial in the 
BMW  Group’s point of view. When engaging in dialogue 
with political stakeholders in the main markets, the follow -
ing topics are key for the BMW  Group:
– Promotion of electric mobility and comprehensive 
expansion of the charging infrastructure
–  Continued development of the regulatory framework 
for autonomous driving and digital networks
–  Political control of emission limits without discriminat -
ing against individual vehicle categories
–  Support for new efficiency  technologies
–  Realistic relationship between emission targets and 
emission measurement methods
–  Consistency of supply-side and demand-side policy  measures for decarbonisation
–  Ensuring  sufficient  supply of critical raw materials.
Main feedback from our stakeholders in the 2018  
 dialogues on the topic “Cities in progress”
In 2018, five  BMW  Group dialogue meetings were held 
once again to discuss the topic areas of “urban mobility” 
and “digitalisation”.  During the meetings  we talked with 
students, experts and other stakeholders about the chal -
lenges of sustainable urban development. In 2018 , these 
events were held in Los Angeles/US,  Melbourne/AU, 
Shenzhen/CN,  Rotterdam/NL  and Berlin/DE.• see

In May 2018 , experts at the BMW  Group and stakeholders 
in Berlin/DE  held joint discussions  regarding  critical raw 
material supply chains.
In the year under review, we received several inquiries 
about our supply chain. This shows the high expecta -
tions that our stakeholders have of us. We will therefore 
continue the discourse on sustainable raw material pro -
curement with our partners and suppliers in order to work 
on common solutions for a more transparent, more social 
and more environmentally compatible supply chain.• see

Among the greatest challenges the 
municipalities face are high traffic  volumes, poor air quality and the 
 negative impacts of traffic planning 
on the cityscape, and thus on  people’s 
quality of life. The results of the 
market survey on the most immediate challenges for urban mobility confirm this (traffic jams 65%, lack of parking spaces 48% and air pollution 39%)
1  
• Chapter  2Traffic jams, lack of 
space and air quality are most immediate challenges
According to stakeholders, to 
 address these urban mobility chal -
lenges, the municipalities themselves 
have a  particularly large responsibility 
to contribute towards a solution.  
40% of the participants in our online survey also shared this opinion.
2Responsibility 
for solution lies  primarily with 
municipalities
Combustion engines are expected to 
play a less important role in cities in the future. The BMW Group should  offer primarily emission-free vehicles. 
This was also supported by 45% of the 
participants in the market survey.

Enforcing human rights and environmental standards  
in the supply chain through collective action and  
transparency
The discourse around sustainable raw material procure -
ment is of great importance for the BMW  Group. Cobalt 
is a key component  in the production  of electrified  ve-
hicles and large amounts of it are contained in high-volt -
age batteries of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. As 
cobalt mining runs the risk of human rights violations, 
we are working on a number of levels to increasing trans -
parency of the cobalt supply chain. In addition to intern -
al measures to increase transparency in the supply chain, 
we are involved in projects such as the Responsible Cobalt 
Initiative ( RCI).• G22

Stakeholders expect systematic consideration of  
animal welfare 
Numerous enquiries in the year under review have 
spelled out how important animal welfare is to our stake -
holders. In response, we carried out a relevance analysis 
during the year, in which we evaluated both the aspects 
of “animal testing” and “animal products”.  In order to se-
cure the systematic consideration of animal welfare in 
the context of our own activities and with our suppliers, 
we made appropriate additions to the code of practice for 
employees. In addition, we have extended our sustain -
ability standards for the supplier network, which stipu -
late that animal testing is to be avoided unless it is pre -
scribed by law. Likewise, we have also supplemented our 
general contractual conditions for indirect purchasing. 
Additionally, we plan to supplement the international 
purchasing conditions for production material and motor 
vehicle components during the next revision, which is 
scheduled to take place in 2021 , in order to stipulate re -
quirements for the assurance of animal welfare.23

COMPLIANCE AND 
 HUMAN RIGHTS
Sustainability goal: 
The aim of our compliance management system is to 
 ensure legal conformity of all BMW  Group activities
Responsible and lawful conduct, with respect for human 
rights, is firmly established as part of the BMW  Group’s 
corporate culture. We also expect this from our business 
partners throughout the value chain. In our view, integrity 
and compliance with the law are basic requirements for 
long-term business relationships. Practising these values 
within the company builds trust among our customers, 
shareholders, business partners and the general public, 
thereby ensuring the long-term success of our company. 
Key measures: 
Establishing legal conformity and implementing labour 
standards worldwide
The BMW  Group Legal Compliance Code forms the basis 
of our compliance management system. It spells out the 
Board of Management’s commitment to compliance as a 
joint responsibility and underlines all employees’ obliga -
tion to act responsibly and in compliance with applicable 
laws. 
In 2018 , the BMW  Group published its • BMW  Group Code on 
Human Rights and Working Conditions , which supplements the 
Joint Declaration  on Human Rights and Working  Condi -
tions at the BMW  Group of 2010 . The Code is based on a 
due diligence process that allows us to identify relevant 
 aspects and take appropriate action. It strengthens our commitment to human rights and outlines how the 
BMW  Group promotes respect for human rights and imple -
ments the core labour standards of the ILO in its business 
activities worldwide. 
Managing compliance
Our group-wide compliance management system is oriented 
towards the BMW  Group’s risk situation and also covers 
the Financial  Services  segment.  With defined structures  
and processes, it creates the necessary regulatory frame -
work, so that every employee is aware of their compliance 
responsibility and lawful conduct is systematically ensured. 
Key components of this system include internal compliance 
regulations, legal monitoring, complaint and case manage -
ment, compliance controls and compliance reporting as 
well as employee training and communications activities.  
• Annual Report 2018 
In 2018 , we implemented a group-wide communications 
campaign aimed at boosting integrity and responsibility 
among all employees. The IT-based applications of the com -
pliance management system have been further expanded 
and use of compliance IT systems rolled out at our locations 
worldwide. 
The compliance management system is applied to all com -
pliance topics: in particular, to prevent corruption and 
anti -competitive conduct and to ensure respect for human 
rights – especially the ILO core labour standards – at all 
our locations. 
In our annual compliance reporting, we ask all organisa -
tional units of the BMW  Group, amongst others, for a local 
risk assessment for human rights violations. Their responses 
form the basis for developing local measures to minimise 
risks. • GRI  412 -125

Combined separate non-financial report
Employees can turn to their managers or the BMW  Group 
Compliance Contact with questions relating to compliance. 
Non-employees may also use this method to report possible 
infringements. Within the company, possible violations of 
the law can be reported anonymously via the BMW  Group 
SpeakUP Line. The BMW  Group Compliance Committee 
Office investigates  reports and initiates measures  to address 
any issues.
Identifying and minimising risk in the  
financial services business
Due to the nature of its products  and processes,  the financial 
services business  entails specific risks. The focus here is on 
anti-money laundering measures, data protection, fraud pre -
vention, legislative and regulatory monitoring as well as 
consumer lending protection. To address the risks in these 
areas, a “compliance  coordination”  function  was created 
within the Financial Services segment as a delegated func -
tion of the BMW Group Compliance  Committee  Office. 
Based on an annual trend analysis,  it identifies  new or mod -
ified regulatory  requirements  in the financial  services sector 
and defines the necessary  measures.  Implementation  by the 
BMW Group’s financial services companies  worldwide  is fol-
lowed through on a quarterly basis. Compliance is incorp -
orated into the target process for the Financial Services seg -
ment. Integration  of specific targets into our balanced  score -
card system underlines the importance of the topic and 
helps monitor implementation. We also use a management 
system to identify risks of non-compliance with internal and 
external regulations at an early stage.Demanding respect for human rights 
Specific human rights risks arise in the supply chain due 
to the international and collaborative nature of value cre -
ation processes in the automotive industry. For this reason, 
we have integrated human rights into the BMW  Group sus -
tainability standard for the supplier network • GRI  412 -3  and 
established an appropriate risk management process. 
In addition to the company’s international purchasing 
terms and conditions, BMW  Group importer contracts also 
contain a clause on compliance and human rights, which 
will gradually be included in all dealer contracts worldwide 
by 2020 . Human rights obligations are also taken into 
 account in choosing sites and in investment decisions. 
• GRI  205 -2, 412 -3
Due diligence processes:
Systematically ensuring lawful conduct
To provide systematic protection against compliance-related 
and reputational risks, the Board of Management created a 
Compliance Committee in 2007  to control and monitor the 
necessary activities. The scope and intensity of our compli -
ance activities are determined on the basis of a group-wide 
compliance risk assessment that is updated annually. 
Group-wide compliance management activities are imple -
mented at operational level by the BMW  Group Com -
pliance Committee  Office, supported  by local compliance  
functions. These functions were expanded in the year 
 under review.
Compliance with and implementation of the BMW  Group 
Legal Compliance Code and internal compliance regula -
tions are audited regularly by Corporate Audit. The 
BMW Group Compliance  Committee  Office also conducts 
spot checks in conjunction with a forensic service provider, 
focusing primarily on corruption prevention. In 2018 , spe -
cific antitrust  validations  were introduced,  in addition,  to 
identity and audit possible antitrust risks at the company. 
The organisational units for audit are selected on the basis 
of a group-wide compliance risk assessment. • GRI  205 -1• see

BMW  Group position on antitrust allegations
In July  2017 , the media reported on suspected antitrust in -
fringements by the German automotive industry. Follow -
ing an inspection at the BMW  Group in October 2017 , the 
European Commission opened formal proceedings in con -
nection  with antitrust  allegations  against five German 
auto mobile manufacturers on 18 September 2018 . This 
constitutes a formal step without prejudice to any possible 
antitrust infringement.  
– The BMW  Group has assisted the European 
 Commission with its work from the beginning and 
will continue to do so.
– In this context, the BMW  Group wishes to emphasise 
the clear distinction between potential violations of antitrust law, on the one hand, and illegal manipu -
lation of exhaust gas treatment, on the other. The 
BMW  Group has not been accused of the latter.
– The BMW  Group is looking into the allegations of 
 possible violations of antitrust law very closely. We are 
fully committed to the principles of the market 
 economy and fair competition.
The BMW  Group is unable to comment further on the pro -
ceedings while the investigation is still ongoing.  • GRI  206 -1 
International conventions and principles
Our models for ensuring compliance with environmental and social stand-
ards throughout the value chain are based on various internationally 
 recognised guidelines. This especially applies to the • Guidelines for 
Multinational Enterprises  issued by the Organisation for Economic 
 Cooperation and Development (OECD), the  • UN Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights , the contents of the • ICC Business 
Charter for Sustainable Development and the • United Nations 
Environment Programme’s (UNEP) International Declaration on 
Cleaner Production.
By signing the • United Nations Global Compact  by the BMW AG 
Board of Management in 2001 and issuing a • Joint Declaration on 
Human Rights and Working Conditions in the BMW Group , we com -
mitted to abide by internationally recognised human rights and the core 
labour standards of the • Inter national Labour Organization (ILO).  
This commitment is also reflected in the • BMW Group Code on 
 Human Rights and Working Conditions , which has been ratified by 
the Board of Management and employee representatives. Our due 
 diligence process for human rights is geared towards the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights. • GRI 102-12, 102-16

PRODUCT SAFETY
Sustainability goal: 
The BMW  Group offers its customers and other road users 
the highest safety standards
The safety of our vehicles is the central component of our 
product responsibility. The BMW  Group considers product 
safety to be a holistic challenge. By incorporating active and 
passive safety systems in our vehicles, excluding hazardous 
materials, offering safe driving courses and providing 
 appropriate product information, we want to contribute 
 towards safety in road traffic and meet the requirements of 
our customers.Key measures: 
Comprehensively addressing product responsibility
In order to minimise the risk of accident and injury for our 
customers and other road users, we equip our vehicles with 
active and passive safety systems that meet the latest tech -
nical standards. These safety measures include perfect 
chassis tuning, strengthened passenger compartments, ef -
fective brakes, airbags and driver assistance systems.
With the BMW  and MINI  Driving Experience, we also of -
fer training courses in 30 countries for BMW s, MINI s and 
BMW  motorcycles which help to ensure the safety of our 
customers and other road users. In the year under review, 
we expanded our range of training courses in response to 
customer  needs and the increasing  significance  of electric 
mobility. In total, we trained over 124,000 participants at 
international training locations in 2018 .
Starting at the design stage of our vehicles, we pay atten -
tion to the avoidance of potential hazardous materials and 
minimisation of emissions in the passenger compartment. 
In this way, we ensure that the legal requirements in terms 
of product safety, protection of human health and the en -
vironment are complied with worldwide for each phase of 
the vehicle life cycle (from development to utilisation, 
through to recycling and disposal). In addition, all vehicles 
that belong to the BMW , MINI  and Rolls-Royce brands are 
equipped  with passenger  compartment  air filters, which fil-
ter out pollutants and particles such as dust or pollen from 
the outside air.
We also provide our customers with comprehensive infor -
mation on how to use our products and mobility services 
correctly. Information on the safety of our vehicles and on 
the protection of our customers’ health is available in the 
in-vehicle operating manuals, in printed form or as an app 
for smartphones and on the Internet. This data is supple -
mented by information on the vehicle and additional back -
ground information on services, accessories and compon -

Combined separate non-financial reporta component may be faulty, but does not present an imme -
diate danger. This involves an inspection of the vehicles 
and if necessary, the exchange of the faulty components. In 
the event of a safety risk, we conduct recall campaigns in 
cooperation with the responsible authorities. For this pur -
pose, the BMW  Group has established appropriate commit -
tees, processes and organisations, which are managed by 
the head department for Product Support, Technical Cam -
paigns and Warranty Costs. • GRI  416 -1
Results and performance indicators: 
Continuous improvement of safety
With ongoing innovation and development in safety sys -
tems, we continue to enhance the safety of the people who 
use our vehicles. At the same time, our measures contribute 
towards  increasing  the safety of other road traffic partici -
pants.
Our next steps:
In the years to come, we will keep working to even further 
enhance the safety of our vehicles. Our particular focus 
will be on connected and autonomous driving.As a basic principle, the BMW  Group follows the funda -
mental premise  of “safety first”. This means that the safety 
requirements  must be fulfilled  before offering  any solu-
tions. Safety is an important prerequisite for customer con -
fidence  in connected  and autonomous  driving.  The 
BMW  Group has created appropriate structures for this 
purpose.
In view of the increasing impact of digitalisation, aspects 
such as data privacy, data security and cybersecurity are 
becoming  ever more important.  “Privacy by Design” means 
that the BMW  Group ensure data privacy by providing cus -
tomers with transparency, informational self-determina -
tion and data security. In order to maintain an appropriate 
level of protection,  we apply our “Security  by Design”  ap-
proach. This involves examining products and services for 
safety aspects throughout the entire product life cycle. 
We use a secure backend for encrypted data communica -
tion between the vehicle and the BMW  Group. This serves 
to minimise  the vulnerability  of the vehicle fleet to un-
authorised access by preventing a direct, often unprotect -
ed, data transfer from the vehicle to third parties. For con -
tinuous improvement in the level of protection, the 
BMW  Group engages in an ongoing exchange of informa -
tion with national and international security and cyber -
security authorities.
Due diligence processes: 
Guaranteeing security through systematic management
BMW  Group products are developed and manufactured in 
strict compliance with quality management systems. All 
models are subject to thorough audits with regard to ve  hicle 
safety. 
Our quality management also covers the use of the vehicles. 
We also monitor our vehicles on the market and follow up 
on any reports relating to safety. If required, we immedi -
ately inform the responsible authorities and introduce all 
necessary measures to protect our customers. We carry out 
voluntary technical campaigns if there is an indication that 30

Global developments such as climate change and urbanisation constitute considerable challenges for 
the automotive industry. Added to this are sharply diverging market conditions. At the same, however, 
these offer great opportunities for companies that operate in a sustainable manner. The BMW Group is 
therefore pressing ahead with the transformation of its product portfolio. We are constantly working on making our vehicle platforms, vehicle designs and production processes more flexible. In future, this 
will allow us to offer our models equipped with fully electric drivetrains, as plug-in hybrid vehicles or 
with highly efficient combustion engines, depending on requirements. We continually enhance our  mobility services with innovative solutions for urban mobility and are pressing ahead with digitalisation. 
In doing so, we intend to improve the quality of life in cities and also take advantage of market opportu -

EMISSIONS OF  
CO 2 AND POLLUTANTS
Sustainability goal: 
By 2020 , the BMW  Group will have reduced CO 2 emissions 
in the European new vehicle fleet (EU- 28) by at least 50% 
compared to the base year 1995
Climate change and the burdens placed on air quality, espe -
cially in cities, are among the key challenges we face. We 
therefore consistently strive to reduce emissions of CO 2 and 
pollutants in the development of our vehicle fleet. In redu -
cing emissions of CO 2 and pollutants, we intend to continue 
to meet the statutory limit worldwide in future. Incentives 
for sustainable mobility also play an important role in the 
purchase decision of customers. Besides buyer’s premiums 
and reduced taxes, examples of these include exceptions to 
potential traffic restrictions as well as preferential treatment 
in lane usage and concessions in parking policies for electri -
fied vehicles. We respond to the growing environmental 
awareness of many customers by expanding our portfolio of 
low-emission, efficient vehicles. 
With these measures, we intend to contribute in particular 
to the SDG s 3 (Good health and well-being for people), 
9  (Industry, innovation and infrastructure), 12 (Responsible 
consumption and production) and 13 (Climate action).Key measures: 
Lowering emissions from vehicle use with efficiency 
technologies and solutions for pollutant reduction
In our conventional drive vehicles, we currently achieve 
the most effective impact on lowering  CO 2 and pollutant 
emissions  through  our efficiency  technologies  and through  
specific solutions  for pollutant  reduction.
A reduction in local emissions of nitrogen oxide (NO x) in 
particular is needed to improve urban air quality. All  diesel 
models of the BMW Group have been fitted with a highly 
effective  combination  of a NO x storage catalytic converter 
(NSC ) and a SCR  system ( SCR , Selective Catalytic Reduc -
tion) with urea injection (AdBlue) since mid- 2018  (except 
for MINI  3-door cars, 5-door cars and convertible models). 
The larger MINI  diesel models also use these technologies.1 
In terms of climate protection, reducing global CO 2 emis -
sions is imperative. Since 2007, our Efficient  Dynamics  
projects  have helped us integrate  efficiency  technologies  
in our vehicles,  in accordance  with the specific require -
ments of individual models, engines and the respective 
markets.
Offering more low-emission electrified models
Models with electric drivetrains  in our new vehicle fleet  also 
do their part in lowering CO 2 and pollutant emissions. To 
 familiarise customers as well as possible with electromobil  ity, 
we launched the fully electric battery model ( BEV) BMW  i3* 
in 2013  and the plug-in hybrid model ( PHEV ) BMW  i8* in 
2014 . In addition to the BMW i vehicles, we have six BMW  
PHEV  models and a MINI plug-in hybrid that we offer our 
customers worldwide. By 2025, we plan to offer  25 electri -
fied models, of which twelve will be purely electric.
1    This applies to the diesel models available for order in Europe and to the regions that 
adhere to European exhaust emissions legislation on diesel engines, for example through the UN Economic Commission for Europe. Generally speaking, only diesel models of the BMW Group with the NSC and SCR combination system are offered in the USA (MINIs with 
diesel engines are not available).

Results and performance indicators:  
Further reduction in emissions 
The BMW  Group reduced CO 2 emissions of its newly sold ve -
hicles in Europe by around 42 % between 1995  and 2018  
(2017: 42 %). In 2018, our European  new vehicle fleet (EU-28) 
had an average fuel consumption of 4.9 l diesel /  100 km1 and 
6 l petrol /  100 km1 and average CO 2 emissions of 128 g / km1 
(internal BMW  calculation; 2017: 128 g / km1). • GRI  302 -5, 305 -5
Despite a further reduction in the share of diesel vehicles, 
fleet CO 2 emissions in 2018  were maintained at the same 
level as the previous year, which is in part due to the growth 
in sales of electrified  models in Germany.  With  142,617 
units sold ( 2017 : 103,080), the BMW  Group exceeded the 
previously announced annual target of 140,000 electrified 
vehicles.
We intend to continue to meet the EU emissions targets in 
2020  and 2021 , and beyond.
In the USA , the average fuel consumption for the model year 
2018  was 33.62 mpg (model year 2017: 33.5 mpg) and the  
average CO 2 emissions were 168 g CO 2 / km2 (model year 
2017: 168 g CO 2 / km, internal  BMW  calculation). In China, 
average petrol consumption was 6.2 l / 100km3 in 2018  (2017: 
6.5 l / 100 km), and the median CO 2 emissions were 147 g 
CO 2 / km3 (2017: 154 g CO 2 / km).  • GRI  302 -5, 305 -5
1  Since September 2018, all vehicles in the EU must be approved in accordance with the new 
WLTP test cycle. However, the EU Commission will not start using WLTP to calculate fleet CO
2 emissions until 2021. For this reason, the WLTP fleet emissions will need to be 
retroac  tively calculated as NEDC values for the purposes of reporting up to and in 2020. 
The amended WLTP test constraints result in higher NEDC emissions (NEDC-correlated) in 
the retroactive calculation. To guarantee comparability, the fleet CO 2 emissions in 2017 
(122 g / km NEDC) were converted into a correlated NEDC value of 128 g / km under WLTP 
test constraints and disclosed for the first time in the second quarterly report of 2018.

The diversity  and lack of harmonisation  of different  regu -

with huge challenges  and have a significant  impact on cus-

harmonised guidelines, since they make an important 
contribution towards combatting climate change and im -
proving air quality. In the EU, for example, we have the 
harmonised test procedure WLTP  (Worldwide Harmo -

(German Association of the Automotive Industry) and

Combined separate non-financial reportOur Efficient  Dynamics  package  of measures  has played a 
role in significantly  reducing  fuel consumption,  CO 2 emis -
sions and our vehicle emissions since 2007. We want to con -
tinue on this successful path with innovative approaches in 
the areas of combustion engines, aerodynamics and light -
weight design.
We see further potential for reducing fuel consumption and 
pollutant  emissions  in the electrification  of the drivetrain  
and digitalisation. We are developing new models for 2019  
(BEV: MINI , PHEV : X3) and 2020  (BEV: BMW  iX3) and of -
fering the PHEV  models BMW  2-Series, 3-Series, 5-Series, 
7-Series and X 5 with improved electric range in 2019 . In 
2021 , we will make a start on the above-mentioned radically 
new concepts BMW  i4 Vision Dynamics and BMW  iNext. 
Following initial success with navigation-data-supported 
transmission control and the driving assistant, we are also 
investing in further research and development in this area.
From the perspective of the BMW  Group, modern diesel en -
gines will continue to play an important role. We will there -
fore continue  to work on highly effective  air-purity  technolo -
gies for our vehicle portfolio in 2019 . And we will keep on 
optimising our combustion engines with 48-volt recupera -
tion systems and maximum emission reduction. With more 
than 300 model versions available to order ex works, the 
product portfolio of the BMW  Group will largely be 
switched over to the exhaust emission standard Euro 
6d-TEMP by the end of the first quarter of 2019 , which will 
apply to all new vehicles in Europe as of 1 September 2019 . 
All of these models are standardly available to order. The 
delivery time is around three months on average, as is cus -
tomary. The changeover of the remaining model versions to 
the exhaust emission standard Euro 6c is running accord -
ing to plan.
In the coming year, we will continue to address any critical 
questions our customers and the public have about the fu -
ture of diesel technology. We will rebuild trust in the auto -
motive sector through transparency and open discussion.Taking due consideration of the above-mentioned cycle in the 
EU, 141g CO 2 / km1 was the average fleet CO 2 emissions of the 
BMW  Group per kilometre in 2018  (calculation for the key 
markets of EU- 28, USA, China, Japan and Korea), a reduction  
of 1.4% compared to the previous year ( 2017: 143g CO 2 / km1). 
• GRI  305 -3, 305 -5
Since the beginning of the 90s, we have significantly  reduced 
pollutant  emissions  by refining our technologies.  In Europe, 
emissions of nitrogen (NO x) and particulate matter (PM) in 
the new vehicle fleet were lowered by over  90% between 1992  
and 2018, in accordance with the limit values of the Euro stan -
dards. • GRI 305 -7
The introduction of new models with drive technologies that 
ensure lower emissions and pollutants continues to have a 
positive effect on our average fleet CO 2 emissions. We ex -
panded our product range to eleven electrified  models at the 
end of 2018 . For example, the BMW  225xe* Active Tourer 
can save 50% more CO 2 emissions in WLTP  compared to a 
similar model with a combustion engine, such as the BMW  
220i*.
In September 2018 , the NEDC  was replaced by the more 
 realistic test procedure WLTP . The changeover of BMW  
models went according to plan and has been completed.
Falling fuel prices and the associated changes in customer 
demand make it harder for us to achieve the fleet targets set 
for 2020. In addition,  there are regional variations  in fleet use 
due to influencing  factors such as the drivetrain  and segment  
combination, the respective relevant rates and the individ -
ual purchase and road performance.
Our next steps:
The BMW  Group sees itself as a driving force in the devel -
opment of sustainable individual mobility. In this process, 
we focus on both increasingly  efficient,  clean combustion  
engines as well as electromobility.

Emissions caused by diesel engines
More and more cities worldwide are taking action to im -
prove air quality and reduce CO 2 emissions, particularly in 
highly congested city centres. Reducing vehicle emissions 
is an  important starting point. Besides promoting alterna -
tive emission-free drivetrains and an improved range of 
mobility  services,  some cities are also introducing  traffic 
restrictions for vehicles entering into or driving through the city.
Older petrol models (exhaust emission standards Euro 
0 
and 1) and diesel-engine cars (Euro 0 to 2) are perma  nently 
prohibited  from entering  the green zone in Paris / FR.  Driv-
ers of older vehicles (Euro 0 to 3) are required to pay an ex -
tra fee in the inner city of London / GB.  In Germany,  older 
vehicles (Euro 0 to 3, depending  on the classification  of the 
green zone) have been banned since 2007  from entering cer -
tain city regions through the introduction of environmental 
badges. A total of 58 such green zones, of which 57 carry the 
maximum restriction of at least Euro 4 or Euro  3 with parti -
cle filter, now exist in German  cities. Despite these meas-
ures, the debate still centred around urban air quality, par -
ticularly in Germany, in the reporting period. In  several 
German cities, much stricter traffic restrictions  for older die-
sel models (Euro 4 and 5) have already been  decided upon 
and, in some cases, introduced.
In this regard, the German government assists the federal 
states and affected  cities in complying  with the applicable  
air quality limits as quickly as possible and in exploiting the full potential of all measures seeking to reduce nitrogen without restricting mobility. These include modern air pro
-
tection plans and municipal measures, such as creating in -
telligent infrastructure, converting diesel buses and taxis, digitalising  traffic systems  and expanding  electromobility.  
The 
BMW  Group welcomes this concept and, in addition to 
the national • BMW  UMWELTPRÄMIE  (environmental premium),  
has been offering the  • BMW  UMWELTPRÄMIE + (environmental 
premium plus) in selected cities since October 2018, which 
aims to speed up the rejuvenation  of the car fleet and thus make a quick and effective  contribution  towards  reducing  
nitrogen oxide emissions. • GRI  416 -2
In addition, the BMW  Group engages in continuous dia -
logue with cities, inhabitants and authorities in order to de -
velop joint solutions and prevent the restriction of mobility. We offer our customers  electrified  vehicles,  access to mo -
bility services and low-emission petrol and diesel engines. From the perspective of the 
BMW  Group, the modern diesel 
engine can also continue to make an important contribu -
tion towards improving air quality and achieving national and international CO
2 reduction goals in the short and  
medium term. A diesel engine emits 15% less CO 2 than a 
petrol engine on average and there is still no adequate infra -
structure for alternative drivetrain technologies. Political framework conditions in Europe can provide important in
-
centives for speeding up the market penetration of low-emis -
sion diesel.
Retrofitting  the hardware  of cars, which is currently  a topic 
of political discussion in Germany only, does not make 
sense in our opinion. The priority is to improve air quality 
as quickly as possible. Considering the high quality require -
ments and strong customer interest in this regard, we do 
not consider  hardware-retrofitting  to be a solution  that 
would bring about the desired results in the short term. Fur -
thermore, such action would have a negative impact on the quality, consumption and CO
2 emissions as well as on the 
performance  of vehicles due to the necessary  vehicle modifi -
cation and higher weight.
CO 2 limits stepped up in the EU
In December, the EU decided to step up CO 2 limits by 
2030 . By then, CO 2 emissions of new vehicles are expected 
to be reduced by 37.5% compared to 2021 . From the  
perspective of the BMW  Group, this goal can only be 
achieved  by significantly  increasing  the share of electri -
fied vehicles.  We already  offer our customers  a broad 
portfolio of models that we are continually expanding. However, the trends in our various markets show that 
this range is perceived  in different  ways. As one of the 
market leaders for electromobility  in Europe, we find that • see

ELECTROMOBILITY
Sustainability goal:  
The BMW  Group is a leader in taking a holistic approach to 
premium electromobility
Electromobility is one of the central topics of the future 
when it comes to making urban living and traffic sustain -
able. This is reflected again and again in our dialogue with 
stakeholders. Fully electric battery models ( BEVs) have zero 
local emissions and can significantly reduce the emission of 
CO 2 and air pollutants over the whole product life cycle, 
while also markedly reducing traffic noise in cities. The 
BMW  Group develops electrified vehicles1 that combine the 
advantages of sustainable mobility with a new driving ex -
perience for customers. The enhanced efficiency of the elec -
tric engine, compared to the conventional drivetrain tech -
nology, the quicker acceleration and innovative, spacious 
vehicle interior concepts are the crucial selling points here.
We intend to set standards in electromobility. To underline 
our claim to leadership, we are aiming to sell 500,000 ve-
hicles with electric and plug-in hybrid drivetrains by the 
end of 2019 . In doing so, we want to contribute to SDG s 7 
(Affordable and clean energy), 9 (Industry, innovation and 
infrastructure), 11 (Sustainable cities and communities), 12 
(Responsible consumption and production) and 13 (Climate 
action).
1  The term ‘electrified vehicles’ has varying definitions in the automotive industry. The 
BMW  Group defines these as fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles that can be charged 
and driven purely electrically.Key measures:  
Improving life cycle, range and framework conditions
From the very beginning of the BMW  i project, we have pur -
sued the goal of reducing the emissions of CO 2 and other 
 pollutants  throughout  the entire life cycle of our electrified  
vehicles. To this end, we rely on light construction, renewable 
resources  and particularly  resource-efficient  and environ -
mentally friendly production processes. The BMW  value 
chain stands out for its use of renewable energy sources: 
from the manufacture of energy-intensive materials such as 
CFRP (carbon fibre reinforced  polymer),  to vehicle produc -
tion and the BMW Green Energy package we offer our cus-
tomers when they purchase their vehicle. Other approaches 
include the recycling and reuse of batteries, for example in 
stationary storage  units for improved use of renewables.
A key challenge for the success of electromobility is improv -
ing the range of our vehicles. We are working towards this 
goal with a number of measures. According to the NEDC  
 cycle, the range of the BMW  X5 PHEV * increased from 
31 km in 2015 , to 80 km2, and the range of the BMW  i3 BEV* 
from 300 km in 2016 , to 359 km3). In collaboration with oth -
er carmakers, charging station operators, energy suppliers 
and grid operators, we are attempting to simplify access to 
charging stations and the charging procedure. We are work -
ing to achieve this by deploying both our specialist expertise 
and with financial  support.  With the joint venture  IONITY , 
we plan to establish a high-performing rapid charging net -
work with 400 rapid charging stations along major transport 
axes by 2020  at the European level. This will facilitate 
charging that is one to seven times faster than normal 50-
kW stations. Charging times of ten to 15 minutes will thus 
be realistic for appropriately equipped vehicles.• see

Anchoring carbon footprints in product development  
A holistic, life cycle-oriented regard for environmental im -
pact is an integral part of the target systems and organisa -
tional processes in our vehicle development.
We manage the implementation of targets and evaluation 
of progress in the development process by applying the 
Life Cycle Assessment in accordance with ISO standard 
14040 / 44. These carbon footprints allow us to determine at 
the development stage the environmental impact the ve -
hicle will have during its life cycle. This also allows for 
comparison with predecessor models. 
As an example, the • BMW  530 e iPerformance* Environmental 
Report shows that, assuming standard consumption levels, 
the life cycle CO 2 footprint of a plug-in hybrid vehicle is 
around 15% lower than in a conventional reference vehicle, 
taking account of the EU- 28 electricity mix. Furthermore, 
when charging electricity comes from renewable energy, 
the CO 2 footprint is reduced by around 47%. The green -
house gas potential of the purely electric • BMW  i3* can be 
reduced by more than 50%.
We consistently take our reduction targets and market-  
specific fleet requirements  into account  during product 
 development.  To do so, we define specific targets for opti-
misation over the whole life cycle for new vehicle projects 
in each product line. The BMW  Group’s Strategy unit is 
 responsible  for monitoring  and refining our targets.
*  See consumption and CO 2 data, p. 125We want to make electromobility even more convenient for 
private and fleet customers  and continue  to expand our 
BMW  360° ELECTRIC  product and service portfolio for 
state-of-the-art charging solutions. To promote electro -
mobility among our own employees, we are increasing the 
number of charging points in BMW  Group locations. We 
are also continuing  to refine the BMW  Group ChargeNow 
service and merging  charging  stations  of different  
 providers within one expanding network. BMW  subsid -

other OEM s (Original Equipment Manufacturers) access 
to the ChargeNow  network  as a product – the first custom -
er was the PSA Group in France. 
In many countries, there is still a need for governments to 
catch up in terms of political support for electromobility. 
The BMW  Group seeks out dialogue with policy-makers 
 regarding the consistency of policy measures on the supply 
and demand sides. We are involved, for example, in the 
“Nationale  Plattform  Elektromobilität”  (National  Platform  
for Electromobility – NPE ) in Germany and the “Agora 
Verkehrswende”  (Agora traffic transition).  Internationally,  
the BMW  Group is a member of the international advisory 
committee of China EV 100, as well as VELOZ, a non-profit  
organisation in the US state of California which promotes 
electromobility.

Electrified vehicles improved holistically and  
sales increased
In total, we have already sold around 360,000 vehicles with 
electric and plug-in hybrid drivetrains. In 2018 , the 
BMW  Group delivered 142,617 electrified  vehicles  (2017 : 
103,080), thus confirming  its leading role in electromobility.  
Since 2018 , new and existing customers have been able to 
opt for a BMW  i3* model and the third generation of 
high-voltage batteries with a capacity of 42 kilowatt hours.
From 2015  to the end of 2018 , the BMW  Group was also 
active in over 50 projects for improving the charging infra -
structure and initiated the installation of over 13,000 
charging points. High-performing and increasingly wide -

Combined separate non-financial reportOur next steps:
We are continuing to invest in the planning and develop -
ment of new vehicle models in order to expand our port -
folio to 25 electrified  models in all vehicle segments  by 
2025 , twelve of which will be fully electric. We are intend -
ing to offer our high-volume  models as pure battery 
 vehicles as well. Depending on the segment, we want to ex -
tend the range of our fully electric vehicles to up to 700  km. 
The next steps are the launch of the BMW  iX3 (2020 ) and a 
battery-driven electric model of the MINI  brand ( 2019 ).
The BMW Group is deliberately  focusing  its efforts on 
building a broad drivetrain technology base so that in the 
coming years we can continue  to offer innovative  solutions  
for the mobility needs of our customers worldwide. With 
the BMW  iNext in 2021, we will be introducing  the fifth 
generation of our electric drivetrains.  The vehicles in this 
range will be available as scalable modular assembly units. 
This uncouples the vehicle architecture from the drivetrain 
technology.  This means that every model can be fitted with 
a conventional, electric or hybrid drivetrain as required. 
We are pressing ahead with the development of hydrogen 
fuel cell vehicles as a complementary  electrification  option, 
with a view to preserving  flexibility  in terms of alternative  
drivetrains. BMW  also supports the development of hydro -
gen infrastructure as an associated partner of H 2 Mobility 
Deutschland.
In 2019 , we will take further steps to optimise our electri -
fied vehicles  environmentally  over their whole life cycle. 
We plan to further improve the recycling process for bat -
tery cells in order to increase the recycling rate to over 90% 
and avoid downcycling to low-value secondary materials. 
In the reporting period we established a technology con -
sortium together with Northvolt and Umicore. The aim of 
the initiative is to make batteries more sustainable, from 
the development and production stages right through to 
recycling, by closing material cycles. We will inaugurate 
our new competence centre for battery cells in the sum -
mer of 2019 . This will allow us to enhance our research 
 capacities and we intend to expand our expertise, particu -
larly in the area of battery design and cellular chemistry.• see

Supporting positive framework conditions  
for electromobility
Expanding the charging infrastructure is a fundamental 
condition for the breakthrough of electromobility. Posi -
tive regulatory  incentives,  both financial  and functional, 
are a catalyst for the rapid shift from the combustion 
 engine to the electrified  vehicle. Such incentives  that are 
facilitated at the national level and put into practice by 
communal policy are now the main reason why our cus -
tomers actively opt for an electric vehicle. Regarding the financial  incentives,  there is still the issue of the wide 
variation in the intensity and type of promotional meas -
ures from country to country, region to region and city to city. In addition, customers currently react very quickly 
when incentives  are removed  (e. g. tax incentives),  which 
is reflected  in a reduction  in demand.  This is apparent  in 
the Netherlands.  After removing  tax benefits  for plug-in 
hybrids in 
2017, demand for these vehicles almost disap -
peared (– 94% compared to the previous year).
With regard to functional incentives, for example the pri  -
oritisation  of electrified  vehicles over combustion   engines 
in car parks, local authorities need to independently devel -
op, communicate  and implement  an electrification  strate -
gy. This would encompass all planned measures, build 
trust in the new technology and thus create security of  
investment for private companies, particularly for the costly development of charging infrastructure. The 
BMW  Group concluded a corresponding agreement with 
the city of Hamburg in 2017  with a view to solving the 
chicken-and-egg problem on a collaborative basis. It was 
agreed that the city, as described above, would further 
 expand the public charging infrastructure and create 
privileged  parking  spaces for electrified  vehicles.  The 
BMW  Group has heavily invested its own funds into 
 gradually  electrifying  the carsharing  fleet of DriveNow  in 
Hamburg. In the view of the BMW  Group, this coopera -
tive approach is a suitable blueprint for other cities.Other strategically relevant topics
Opening up business models for the energy transition
Back in 2015 , we founded Digital Energy Solutions, a joint 
venture company in collaboration with the Viessmann 
Group. Digital Energy Solutions  offers its customers  intel -
ligent solutions for optimal energy consumption in the 
areas of mobility, heat and electricity. In addition to the 
installation and networking of charging infrastructure 
for customers, the portfolio includes digital services,  intelligent IT solutions as well as the development and 
digital networking of storage solutions.
This allows us to tap into new business areas that are 
emerging at the interface between mobility and energy in 
the course of the energy transition. Our common goal is, for example,  to help fleet operators  make the switch to 
electromobility and support small and medium-sized companies in reducing their energy requirements and 
 
optimising  energy flows. An energy management  system 
developed by BMW  is applied in this process to minimise 
the energy consumption of customers. Stationary electrici -
ty storage facilities or an electric car fleet can easily be inte-
grated to balance out peak loads. This is key to reducing operating expenses in industrial enterprises with energy-
 
intensive  production.  Customers  benefit from this service 
in three ways: their energy costs are optimised holistically, 
their carbon footprint is reduced sustainably and they can 
be sure of improved security of supply at their company  
locations.
Sustainable  solutions  for fleet customers  are taking on in-
creasing importance. This is the speciality of Alphabet 
Fuhrpark Management GmbH, through which we provide 
customers with targeted advice on the adoption of electro -
mobility solutions.45

frastructure. This becomes clear when looking at the sales 
of the BMW  Group in Europe.
If you compare the number of electrified  vehicles  of the 
BMW  Group  in Europe, it is apparent that our share of elec -
tric vehicles is relatively low, particularly in the high volume 
markets.  The general share of electrified  vehicles,  for exam -
ple, in Germany ( 2018: 1.9%)* or United Kingdom and Ireland 
(2018: 2.3%) is still relatively low. To achieve the new EU 2030  
CO 2 emissions  targets, we believe that effective promotional  
measures, combined with the comprehensive expansion of 
the charging  infrastructure,  which will significantly  increase 
the share of electrified  vehicles,  are required  throughout

customers in the individual European countries. Despite offering the same range across countries,  there are some 
clear differences  in market penetration . In the view of the

MOBILITY PATTERNS
Sustainability goal: 
The BMW  Group will have permanently changed mobility 
patterns in selected metropolitan areas by 2020  through 
the introduction of integrated mobility services
The BMW  Group offers its customers individual mobility 
at premium quality. The focus is always on our brand 
promise of driving enjoyment. This has become a chal -
lenge, especially in densely populated urban spaces, but 
 also on the motorways around large cities. By 2030 , a pro -
jected 60% of people worldwide will live in cities. The 
 increasing volume of traffic in cities often goes hand in 
hand with a significant rise in noise and air pollution, con -
sumption of space as well as increased risk of accidents. 
We are proactive in taking these challenges into account as 
we develop our networked vehicles and mobility services. 
Our measures are designed to contribute to SDG s 9 (Indus -
try, innovation and infrastructure), 11 (Sustainable cities 
and communities) and 13 (Climate action).
Renewing our business model is also necessary due to 
 profound changes in the mobility market. The integration 
of cars into an intermodal, increasingly digital transport 
system – especially in urban areas – is seen as a great 
 entrepreneurial challenge. The technological shift towards 
electrification, digitalisation and new providers for mobil -
ity services is fundamentally changing the sector.Key measures: 
Improving urban quality of life with networked  
and automated driving
Automated and digitally networked vehicles have the po -
tential to significantly  reduce the frequency  of traffic jams, 
lower the risk of accidents, reduce emissions and improve 
the quality of life in cities. This applies especially when  
using electrification.  State-of-the-art  driver assistance  sys-
tems are already available in the 5-Series and 7-Series BMW  
models as well as in the BMW  X3 and BMW  X5. At present, 
the first highly automated  research  vehicles not only drive 
on motorways but are also being used for testing purposes 
in city traffic in Munich / DE  as well as in selected cities in 
China and the USA . During these tests, drivers who can 
take over control in any situation are always in the vehicle.
We want to bring the first highly automated  vehicle, the BMW  
iNEXT , onto the market in 2021 . The driver can delegate 
driving to the car during longer periods on motorways and 
up to a speed of 130  km / h. In the same year, a test fleet of 
BMW  iNEXT  vehicles will put automated driving in the ur -
ban environment to the test in several cities on various con -
tinents. With regard to development, we are relying both on 
our own technological strength and collaboration with inno -
vative partners. In this way, we also intend to establish an 
open industry standard for highly and fully automated driv -
ing (“non-exclusive  industry  platform”).
Facilitating sustainable mobility patterns with services
The BMW Group continually  refines its mobility services in 
order to facilitate  more efficient  and less resource-intensive  
transportation. This allows us to provide more and more 
 people with on-demand mobility services with DriveNow in 
Europe and ReachNow in the USA  and China. ReachNow 
provides an ecosystem of mobility services in one app in 
 Seattle’s innovation market. In addition to carsharing and 
ride hailing, subscription models and B 2B offers are also 
 being developed and piloted. ChargeNow is the world’s 
largest service for the public charging of vehicles. The ChargeNow,

Combined separate non-financial reportPreventively protecting information and customer data 
The protection of information and data is an integral part of 
business processes at the BMW  Group. Data protection ad -
heres to the relevant laws, in particular the EU General Data 
Protection Regulation. Our information protection complies 
with the international security standard ISO / IEC 27001 . Per-
sonal data from customers is only collected, processed or 
used if this is legally permissible and the person in question 
has given consent. We address complaints in a timely way. 
In order to protect our digital systems from manipulations, 
we systematically search out weak points and close any 
 potential gaps in good time before releasing the respective 
component. We continuously convert new insights into 
 mandatory standards. There are also clear guidelines for in -
formation and data protection for cooperation and partner 
relationships. 
In 2017, we introduced BMW  CarData in Europe. This is a 
service that gives customers the option of deciding about the 
utilisation and transmission of data from their vehicles to 
third parties in compliance with data protection legislation. 
We now want to establish this service in other core markets 
such as the USA .
Results and performance indicators:  
Autonomous driving further advanced with BMW  Vision 
iNext, and artificial intelligence and cooperation network 
expanded
The presentation of BMW  Vision iNext in 2018  was another 
important milestone on the road to the autonomous vehicle. 
And we officially  opened our Autonomous  Driving Campus 
in Unterschleissheim, Germany, with capacity for around 
1,800 employees. 
Artificial  intelligence  has been used in the new  BMW  X5 
since 2018  to anticipate typical hazardous situations, for 
 example  when vehicles  merge in traffic and respond 
 accordingly. The learning process always takes place on the 
central computer system of our development unit, so that 
all vehicles  are fitted with identical  and safeguarded  BMW  i3* integrates  different  modes of transport  into 
 personal route planning (intermodal routing). This is the 
BMW  Group’s  contribution towards increasing intermodal 
mobility in cities. The innovative digital parking service Park -
Now facilitates ticketless and cashless parking on the street 
and in the car park. It has been available in many cities in 
Germany, Austria, France and Switzerland as an app or as an 
integrated service through Connected Drive in the naviga -
tion system of BMW  models since 2016 . We are also convey -
ing the benefits of our mobility services in pilot projects in  
selected cities.
Due diligence processes: 
Taking changes and effects of urban mobility  
behaviour into account at an early stage
In order to understand changes, impacts and needs of ur -
ban mobility patterns worldwide in good time, the 
BMW  Group takes part in projects focused on dialogue, ini -
tiators and research. These include the BMW  Institute for 
Mobility Research (ifmo) and the BMW  Group Dialogues 
with stakeholders. We systematically integrate the insights 
gained from these into the development processes for new 
vehicle models and services. The BMW  Group Urban Mobil -
ity competence centre is also responsible for implementing 
scalable solutions in cooperation with cities by improving 
framework conditions. One example of this is our agree -
ment with the city of Hamburg. We manage the develop -
ment of our mobility services and fully automated driving 
centrally via the business divisions of the same name.

Combined separate non-financial reportInvestment in new mobility concepts
In 2018 , the BMW  Group once again invested through 
 iVentures in innovative mobility concepts in the • Mapillary , 
• Vera and • Lime start-ups, among others. Mapillary opti -
mises maps by acquiring more precise data by means of com -
puter vision from an extensive database of streetscapes. Vera  
develops data-centric safety and control solutions that facili -
tate the simple monitoring, control and management of data 
access and access rights. Lime provides on-demand micro-  
mobility services, often exclusively, in the USA  and Europe. 
These include bicycles, e-bikes and electric scooters.
Our next steps:
We will continue to work on the intelligent interconnection 
of mobility services, vehicles and infrastructure in order to 
make urban mobility  more flexible, convenient,  sustainable  
and safe. We want to rapidly expand this business model 
in order to allow for a quick, global scaling of the offering. 
To do this, we are planning to merge our mobility services 
with those of Daimler AG in a joint venture. The relevant 
competition authorities approved the plan last year. The 
50/50 joint venture will comprise the following activities 
and services: multimodal and on-demand mobility (moovel 
and ReachNow), carsharing (car 2go and DriveNow), ride- 
hailing (mytaxi,  Chauffeur  Privé, Clever Taxi and Beat), 
parking (ParkNow  and Parkmobile  Group / Parkmobile  
LLC) and charging (ChargeNow and Digital Charging 
Solutions).
According to forecasts, by 2030  many vehicles in urban 
traffic will be automated,  networked  and electric.  In dia-
logue with municipalities and in public partnerships, we 
will contribute  more towards  offering  sustainable  and 
 tailored mobility offers like the DriveNow  and ReachNow  
on-demand services to all residents. We will also markedly 
expand the availability of our intelligent parking and 
charging services ParkNow and ChargeNow. Besides indi -
vidual comfort for our customers, our focus is on reducing 
traffic volumes  and associated  emissions  as well as on 
 recovering urban space for inhabitants. features.  To ensure that the use of artificial  intelligence  is 
 always hazard-free for humans, we have developed our 
own  process to methodically safeguard this. We share our 
experiences in the German research project PEGASUS  with 
the goal of establishing industry-wide standards in the area 
of testing through to the approval of highly automated 
 driving functions by mid- 2019 . In 2018 , we also signed a 
Memorandum of Understanding on accession to Apollo, the 
open platform for autonomous driving of the Chinese tech -
nology company Baidu.
We have further expanded our cooperation network to 
 ensure that we reach our targets for automated and net -
worked vehicles by 2021 . Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is a new 
partner in the existing alliance with Intel and Mobileye. 
Increase in number of customers of mobility services  
By 31 December 2018, the DriveNow car-sharing service had 
1,175,000 customers across Europe ( 2017: 1,026,000) and is 
now available  in twelve European  cities. The DriveNow  fleet 
currently comprises around 6,500 vehicles, of which around 
15% are purely electric BMW  i3 vehicles. Over 420,000 cus-
tomers have driven more than 29.6 million emission-free 
 kilometres with the electric BMW  i3 since 2013 . DriveNow is 
one of the strongest drivers of electromobility in Germany. 
Our ReachNow service in the USA  counted more than 
103,000 customers by the end of the year ( 2017: 82,000). More 
than 1,000 vehicles are available to members, of which 
around 8% are purely electric BMW  i3 models. 
The ParkNow Group served more than 29 million customers 
worldwide across all brands in 2018 .

Addressing framework conditions and challenges  
of automated driving
At the centre of our concepts and technical develop -
ments for automated driving are the safety of drivers, 
passengers, pedestrians and other road users. Therefore, 
clear legal framework conditions need to accompany the introduction and advancement of this technology. The 
data transfer that accompanies digitalisation and automa -
tion also intensifies  the requirements  placed on aspects 
of manipulation and data privacy. We are meeting these requirements appropriately.
With an increasing degree of automation, the challenges 
are not only legal in nature, but also societal and ethical. 
The legal framework is being adjusted worldwide. For ex -
ample, up to 
100,000 vehicles can be licensed with special 
permits in the USA . With regard to legislation about 
 automated driving, Germany is currently playing a lead -
ing role. Also, a separate ethics commission on behalf of 
the federal government has developed 20 guidelines for 
programming automated drive systems. The BMW  Group 
sees that there is still a way to go in terms of European 
approval of automated driving systems that are regulated 
in UN bodies. For this very reason, the EU commission is pushing ahead with a exemption regulation similar to 
that in the 
USA . A number of activities have been 
launched in China to create a regulatory framework for 
automated driving.
In the view of the BMW  Group, additional regulations 
are also required  in relation to the rolling out of fleets of 
automated vehicles for customer operations in cities in 
conjunction with mobility services such as ride-sharing or ride-pooling. For example passengers should be able to 
enter or exit the vehicle at locations they are already used 
to when taking conventional taxis, such as at entrances and in lay-bys. In conjunction with the above-mentioned 
mobility services, the Urban Mobility competence centre 
of the 
BMW  Group cooperates with many cities through Other strategically relevant topics
Promoting electromobility and on-demand  
mobility services in urban areas
The BMW  Group believes that designing urban mobility 
with the goals of quality of life and economic growth ne -
cessitates a change in mindset. Accordingly, we focus on developing innovative technologies and concepts. How successful electromobility and on-demand mobility ser -
vices are in becoming established also depends to a large degree on the prevailing  framework  conditions.  A signifi-
cant market penetration of electromobility requires more 
than the availability of charging infrastructure and  
further purchasing incentives. If the users of electric or 
car-sharing vehicles gain privileged access to public park -
ing spaces, for example,  then this means a significant  ad-
vantage they can enjoy on a daily basis. Such support measures  have the potential  to influence  purchasing  and 
utilisation decisions in the desired direction.
The German electromobility and car-sharing laws allow the granting of privileges for the respective vehicles in 
public spaces. However, privileging certain vehicles can 
also cause conflict,  especially  because  parking  spaces in 
cities are so scarce and in high demand. To debate the 
existing opportunities with residents and local stake
-
holders, and develop and implement these, the 
BMW  Group has initiated pilot projects in • Hamburg  / DE, 
• Berlin / DE  and  • Munich  / DE. The point is to start the ball 
rolling with residents and to communicate the results to other cities and communities. In our view, this contributes 
to a faster dissemination of sustainable mobility concepts.53

VALUE CREATION
Climate change, scarcity of resources and social inequality are some of the greatest challenges 
 facing society today. In order to live up to our claim of being the most sustainable premium manufac -
turer, we are continuously reducing CO 2 emissions and resources used per vehicle produced and are 
setting a good example within our own production network. We are increasingly using renewable 
 energies at our locations worldwide. At the same time, we foster the implementation of social and 
 environmental standards as well as transparency and resource efficiency in our supply chain. We 
place particular emphasis on the support of initiatives to ensure that sustainability criteria are met 
in the mining and processing of critical raw materials. As electromobility spreads, these measures 
are becoming increasingly important. In this manner, we want to make a contribution towards solving the challenges faced by society, decrease risks and reduce production costs.

CONSUMPTION OF 
RESOURCES
Sustainability goal:
The BMW  Group will reduce its resource consumption  
(energy, water, waste, solvents) per vehicle produced by 
45% by 2020  (base year 2006 )
The effects of climate change, depletion of resources and the 
impact of a growing global population’s increasing consump -
tion on the environment present enormous challenges for our 
society. In order to fulfil our vision of being the most sustain -
able premium manufacturer, we are continuously improving 
our energy- and resource-efficiency and reducing CO 2 emis -
sions in our production processes. With these measures we 
meet our stakeholders’ expectations and also reduce produc -
tion costs in the medium term while at the same time prepar -
ing for expected new legal requirements. In addition, we are 
striving to contribute to fulfilling SDG s 9 (Industry, innova -
tion and infrastructure), 12 (Responsible consumption and 
production) and 13 (Climate action).
Key measures:
Conserving resources by means of optimising processes 
and new technologies
In order to reduce CO 2 emissions and energy consumption, 
we optimise  processes  and invest in more efficient technolo -
gies. By finalising  the switch to LED lighting in the reporting 
year in our Munich / DE,  Dingolfing / DE,  Berlin / DE,  Lands-
hut / DE, Regensburg / DE,  Wackersdorf / DE,  Leipzig / DE  and 
Eisenach / DE  plants, we are able to achieve significant  en ergy 
and cost reductions. In addition, we have introduced new 
painting  technologies  at our plants in Munich / DE  and  Oxford / UK,  reducing  VOC  (volatile organic compounds) 
emissions, which occur in particular during the painting 
 process. 
We also rely on optimised processes and state-of-the-art 
technology to reduce our water consumption and waste  
water. In this context, key measures are introducing water -
less processes in our foundries, repeatedly using treated  
process waste water as well as further optimising processes 
in our paint shops and waste water treatment plants.
In order to minimise waste, we develop recycling and  
re- usage concepts that are customised for waste streams in 
the different  plants, varying legal requirements  and existing 
disposal structures. In addition, starting in the product 
 development phase, we make economical use of resources 
and design products with the aim of ensuring that as  many 
material cycles as possible can be closed. 
Due diligence processes:
Controlling consumption of resources with environmen -
tal management
In 2001 , the BMW  Group signed the United Nations En -
vironment Programme’s “International Declaration on 
Cleaner Production”  and expressly  committed  to keeping 
the environmental impact and resource consumption of 
our production activities as low as possible.
Management and control of resource consumption along 
with the identification  of potential  risks in order to achieve 
our goals form an integral part of environmental manage -
ment at our plants. The steering committee of the 
BMW  Group’s international environmental network con -
trols these measures. Each machine, building and space in 
each plant is allocated to an operator. This person is respon -
sible for the processes and procedures, machines and tech -
nical systems as well as their environmental impacts in their 
allocated area.• see

 Improvement in resource consumption and emissions 
from vehicle production since 2006
3.01  
 
Energy consumption – 38.0%
CO2 emissions – 61.9%
Waste for disposal – 77.5%
Water consumption – 26.7%
Process waste water – 45.1%
Solvent emissions – 62.9%
Our main focus is currently on energy and water consump -
tion. In this area, we systematically follow our reduction 
plans in order to achieve our objectives. And we also con -
tinue to work on making further improvements in other 
 areas where we have already achieved our internal targets.  
Our next steps:
In the area of energy, we will focus on continuously utilising 
the potential of continuous process improvements in the 
coming years. In this way we will further reduce energy con -
sumption and CO 2 emissions in our production processes. 
We will achieve this, for example, by reducing the base -
load – the amount of energy that is consumed in the plant, 
even when production is at a standstill.
In addition,  we want to significantly  improve  resource  effi-
ciency by modernising our technical equipment at our 
plants in Dingolfing / DE,  Regensburg / DE,  Leipzig / DE  and 
Rosslyn / ZA  by 2020. From its first full production  year in 
2020 , our new plant in Mexico is to become the most 
 resource-efficient  plant of the BMW  Group.• GWe have established environmental management systems 
at all of our existing production plants and plan to roll 
them out at all future locations. With the exception of 
 motorcycle  production  in Manaus / BR,  where this step is 
planned in the near future, all of our production locations 
worldwide, all German locations including the Research 
and Innovation  Centre in Munich / DE  as well as six others 
in Europe (Vienna / AT,  Zurich / CH,  Rome / IT,  Milan / IT,  
Madrid / ES  and Barcelona / ES)  are ISO 14001 certified.  In 
accordance with ISO 50001 , we incorporated the energy 
management system into our environmental management 
system.
The BMW Group has five environmental  centres of compe -
tence in the areas of emissions, water, waste, training and 
environmental  management  system. They are staffed by 
environmental  experts from the different  plants and by 
specialists from Corporate Environmental Protection. All 
participating managers of the plants as well as the Corpor -
ate Energy Management department of the BMW  Group 
work closely together  in the area of energy efficiency.  Both 
the competence centres and Energy Management discuss 
legal requirements and best practice solutions with tech -
nology experts from the production plants and develop 
reference systems on which to base future planning and 
process improvements. Environmental improvements that 
have been effective  at one location are implemented  at other 
locations wherever possible. Furthermore, we pass on our 
experiences to our suppliers in order to foster sustain -
ability in our supply chain as well.
Results and performance indicators:
Resource efficiency slightly below previous year’s level
Since 2006 , the BMW  Group has reduced its consumption 
of energy and water in vehicle production, waste and waste 
water volume as well as solvents and CO 2 emissions per ve -
hicle produced by an average of 52.0%. In the same period, 
due to our efficient use of resources,  we made cost savings 
totalling  € 167 million. Compared to the previous year, util -
isation of resources and emissions per vehicle produced in 
2018  increased by an average of 2.7%. This is due to the rise • see

Circular economy 
Using Design for Recycling 
Life Cycle Engineering ensures the environmentally 
friendly use of raw materials as early as the vehicle devel -
opment phase. The requirements for recycling-optimised 
development and production of our vehicles as well as se -
lection and use of secondary  materials  are defined in a 
separate BMW  Group standard. We design our supply 
chains and material  flows accordingly.
When using potentially supply-critical raw materials such 
as rare earths, we carefully consider weight, function and 
costs. Wherever it makes technical and environmental sense, we replace artificial  materials  with renewable  ma
-
terials.
In our BMW  i3* in particular, we use a large proportion of 
recycled plastics and natural fabrics. We are currently re -
searching how we can also use plastic that has been re -
covered from rivers or the sea.
The BMW  Group is an active member of “Circular Econ -
omy Initiative  Deutschland”.  The initiative  was set up in 
2018  by acatech, the German National Academy of Sci -
ence and Engineering in collaboration with SYSTEMIQ . 
The initiative is aimed at driving the transformation to -
wards a circular economy with the support of representa -
tives from politics, science, industry and society.

graphic 2.02End-of-life vehicle recovery and recycling
We do not consider end-of-life vehicles as waste to be dis -
posed of, but rather as a secondary source of raw mater -
ials. Established recovery systems for end-of-life vehicles, 
components and materials ensure that they are reinte -
grated into the raw materials cycle. Together with its sales 
organisations in each country, the BMW  Group has in -
stalled recovery systems for end-of-life vehicles in 30 na-
tions and offers vehicle owners environmentally  friendly 
vehicle recycling at more than 2,500 recovery centres. 
GRI 301-3 All BMW  Group vehicles brought onto the 
market since 2008  meet the strictest global requirements 
set for the recycling of end-of-life vehicles, components 
and materials. This results in 95% total recycling, with 
85% reuse and material recycling. • GRI  301 -3
In order to increase our recycling rate even further, we con -
tinuously test recycling concepts for new vehicle compo -
nents at our recycling and dismantling centre. Further -
more, we promote the implementation of new technologies, 
such as the recycling  of batteries  and carbon fibre compo -
nents, through cooperation with research institutes and 
suppliers.
Reusing and recycling batteries
Batteries that are no longer suitable for vehicles may be 
given a new lease of life in stationary storage systems. 
In this way they contribute to integrating renewable en -
ergy into the power grid, increasing grid stability and 
reducing electricity costs for the consumer. We are also 
gradually installing battery storage systems at our own 
sites.  
For batteries that are no longer suitable for use even as a 
stationary storage unit, we aim to achieve the highest pos -
sible rate of recycling of the valuable resources they con -
tain. In collaboration with a university partner, the 
BMW  Group has developed a procedure by which we can 
achieve a recycling rate of more than 90% compared to con -
ventional recycling methods, which achieve just above 50%. 
Here, we want to ensure that resources are not downcycled 
to low-value secondary materials and, if possible, generate • see

recyclates of suitable quality for producing new lithium-ion 
batteries. Currently, for example, we are engaged in a bat -
tery technology development project in collaboration with 
Duesenfeld GmbH to investigate how we can recycle elec -
trolytes and graphite into secondary material that is suit -
able to be used in batteries. Our aim is to be able to do this 
by 2020 .
In the summer of 2019, we are officially  opening  our 
 hi-tech competence centre for battery cells. This will 
 expand our research capacities and we want to widen 
our expertise, in particular in the area of battery design 
and cellular chemistry. Furthermore, we have set up a 
technology consortium with Northvolt and Umicore. 
The initiative is aimed at making battery cells more sus -
tainable, from production to recycling, by closing gaps 
in the material cycles.61

The entire upstream railway system for supplying our inter -
national production plants, for example, has been switched 
to green electricity, from a separate branch line owned by 
BMW  Group, to the export sea ports in Germany. More 
than half of all new vehicles ( 2018 : 51.4%, 2017 : 55.4%) leave 
our plants by rail. Furthermore, we are also using all-elec -
tric as well as gas-powered lorries in plant supply in coop -
eration with logistics service providers. 
With the Design for Recycling principle, we want to ensure 
that as many of the components  as possible flow back into 
the materials cycle once the vehicle has reached the end of 
its life cycle. This leads to lower CO 2 emissions in the value 
chain.
The company’s total CO 2 emissions along the entire value 
chain have increased over the years. This is due to growing 
production and sales volumes. Although emissions per ve -
hicle have gone down over time, we are aware that we also 
need to contribute to protecting the climate by lowering the 
Group’s overall emissions. This is one of the key strategic 
challenges we are faced with.Further key indicators
BMW  Group CO 2 footprint
CO 2 emissions at the BMW  Group locations are generated 
directly from burning fossil fuels (Scope 1 emissions) and 
indirectly through the company’s electricity and heat con -
sumption (Scope 2 emissions). We focus on reducing CO 2 
emissions from our production facilities, which account for 
around 90% of these emissions. We are pursuing our vision 
of carbon-free energy supply at all locations.
Both upstream and downstream in the value chain, we con -
tinually reduce emissions caused by the use and disposal of 
our products, in our supply chain, in transport logistics and 
by employees commuting to and from work (Scope 3 emis -
sions 1). Almost 70% of these emissions are generated during 
utilisation of the vehicles sold. The emissions generated 
during fuel production  are not counted  here. With our Effi-
cient Dynamics  technologies  and our electrification  strategy 
we are continually  reducing  the average fleet emissions  of 
CO 2 per kilometre. 
Around a fifth of Scope  3 emissions are generated in the up -
stream supply chain. We constantly work with our suppliers 
to look for further possibilities  to use resources  more effi-
ciently.  
Furthermore, around 2% of Scope 3 emissions are caused by 
the global transport volume required to supply our produc -
tion plants with materials, to deliver our vehicles and to sup -
ply spare parts to the markets. In order to keep these CO 2 
emissions to an absolute minimum, we work on the prin -
ciple “production  follows the market”.  We also continuously  
work on expanding utilisation of low-carbon energy and 
transport modes.

With regard to the requirements of the Paris Climate Agree -
ment, we have developed our “Green Logistics Strategy 
2050”, which will guide our future activities.  The focus here 
is on low-carbon solutions for road and sea transport.Logistics: carriers and CO 2 emissions
BMW  Group prioritises low-carbon energy sources and 
modes of transport. For example, in October 2018 , we es -
tablished a ferry link between Turkey and Italy to supply 
our European production plants. Previously, the produc -
tion parts manufactured in Turkey were transported by 
road. These are mostly supply-critical components such as 
engine parts and wheels, for which a reliable supply route 
is of particular relevance. In future, all transports from 
Turkey to Germany and the UK will travel on this ferry 
route. In early 2019 , we are switching the route from the 
port of Trieste / IT  to the freight company’s  hub from road 
to rail.
We will also continue to transport more than 50% of the 
finished  vehicles  by rail. In addition,  we were able to 
 reduce air miles by using the improved rail services to 
distribute parts from the regional warehouses in China.
Furthermore, during the reporting period we developed 
strategically relevant and environmentally sustainable 
 logistics concepts in collaboration with freight forwarders, 
infrastructure operators and producers of commercial 
 vehicles. The first “Green Logistics  Strategy  2050” projects have al-
ready been implemented. A total of nine electric lorries are 
on the road for the plant logistics departments at the  
Munich / DE, Landshut / DE, Leipzig / DE and Regensburg /DE  
sites. In addition,  five gas-powered  lorries are already in 
use at the Leipzig / DE  plant. 
Despite our efforts, CO 2 emissions from transport in 2018  
increased by 4.5% compared to the previous year. This is 
mainly due to the increased proportion of air-freight in 
the reporting year. This in turn is the result of the high 
number of starts and discontinuations of vehicle projects 
in the entire plant network as well as the preparations for 
commissioning the new plant in Mexico.

Water consumption
Total water consumption in 2018  rose compared to 2017 . 
At 2.39 m³ ( 2017 : 2.22 m³), water consumption per vehicle 
was also considerably higher than in the previous year. 
This is mainly due to exceptionally high temperatures at 
our locations, which have a direct impact on our water 
consumption rates.
In the reporting period, no sensitive water sources were im -
pacted by water removal (water from nature conservation 
areas), nor are there any plans in this regard in the future.

Waste water
Materials input into waste water should be limited to vol -
umes that will not overtax natural decomposition processes. 
At all of our plants, we have thus introduced our own 
BMW-specific  waste water standards,  some of which con-
siderably exceed local regulations. By reducing waste water 
from sanitary facilities, we were able to slightly reduce the overall volume of waste water. However, process waste water 
volume slightly increased compared to the previous year. 
This is due to the start-up of new paint shops in Rosslyn / ZA  
and Dadong / CN,  the first full year of operation  of the new 
paint shop in Munich / DE  as well as process changes in the

RENEWABLE ENERGY 
The BMW Group is the leader in the use  
of renewable energy in production and  
value creation.
Genuine green electricity: the Bio 2Watt biogas system in South 
Africa, which supplies the Rosslyn/ZA plant, is a prime example 
of how renewable energy is used for production in the 
BMW  Group.Sustainability goal

Combined separate non-financial report3.2  
RENEWABLE ENERGY
Sustainability goal: 
The BMW  Group is the leader in the use of renewable 
 energy in production and value creation
The use of renewable energy in our production processes is 
essential in order to reduce CO 2 emissions and thus help 
prevent the effects of climate change. Therefore, the 
BMW  Group has set itself the objective to supply all produc -
tion plants worldwide exclusively with electricity from re -
newable sources by 2020 . In addition, we are also expanding 
our own renewable generation capacities at our sites. In this 
way, we improve our environmental performance and match 
our stakeholders’ expectation to keep emissions from ve  hicle 
production to a minimum and to use a holistic approach  
towards implementing sustainability in mobility. At the same 
time, we are striving to contribute to fulfilling SDG s 7 (Af-
fordable and clean energy), 9 (Industry, innovation and infra -
structure) and 13 (Climate action).Key measures:
Using renewable energy at our plants
We use renewable energy mainly in our own plants. In or -
der to decide which renewable energy sources are best 
suited to a particular location, we regularly carry out 
country-specific  analyses  to evaluate  the technical,  poli t-
ical and economic  conditions.  We use different  technolo -
gies and solutions accordingly. We always make produc -
ing our own electricity a priority. If this is not entirely 
feas ible due to prevailing technical and economic condi -
tions, we purchase additional electricity from local renew -
able sources if possible. However, this is not always easy, 
in particular in energy markets that are strictly regulated 
by the state or closed, like in China, for example, since 
availability of electricity from renewable sources depends 
on political decisions.
Stabilising the grid by storing energy
In addition, we continuously work on innovative solutions 
for using and storing renewable energy. On our battery 
farm on the premises  of our Leipzig / DE  plant, we use 
high-voltage batteries from the BMW  i3. The storage farm 
is connected to the public electricity grid and can take 
load off the grid in times of renewable  energy peak gener -
ation. When supply is low, the storage system can feed the 
electricity back into the grid. In this way the BMW  Group 
contributes to keeping the public electricity grids stable.
Promoting renewable energy in the supply chain
More than a fifth of our total emissions  (Scope  1, 2 and 3), 
and thus many times the CO 2 emissions at our own plant 
locations, is generated at our suppliers. That’s why we sup -
port the use of renewable energy in our supply chain too. 
As part of the • Supply Chain Programme of the Carbon Disclosure 
Project ( CDP ) we ask our suppliers for details on their CO 2 
emissions and the proportion of renewable energy in their overall energy consumption. In addition, we ask suppliers 
with a good 
CDP  rating  to set themselves emission targets. 
In this way they are making a measurable contribution to -
wards achieving the international climate goal of keeping 
global warming below 2 °C.• see

Results and performance indicators: 
Consistently high levels of renewable energy
In 2018  we covered 79% of our electricity supply with renew -
able energy ( 2017: 81%). Despite this decrease in the share of 
renewable energy, we were able to reduce the relative CO 2 
emissions in production from 0.41 t (2017 ) to 0.40 t per ve -
hicle ( 2018 ). The absolute CO 2 emissions in the production 
network were also reduced by 2.7% (2018 : 962,545 t CO 2; 
2017 : 989,111 t CO 2). Our strategy to expand renewable en -
ergy has proven to be an effective  foundation  for the plan-
ning of concrete measures and can be applied in a wide var -
iety of country contexts. In addition to our production loca -
tions in Europe that are already supplied exclusively with 
electricity from renewable sources, our plant in Brazil also 
covered 100% of its consumption with green electricity in 
2018  (2017: 77%). We have also further expanded our use of 
renewable energy at our locations in Asia. In the reporting 
period we commissioned the photovoltaics system at our 
plant in China and expanded the system at our plant in In -
dia. We regard the continuous growth in the share of renew -
able energy in our production  plants as confirmation  that 
our measures  are having the desired effect.• see

chapter  3.1Due diligence processes: 
Central management and local tracking of the use of 
 renewable energies  
The Real Estate, Facility Management and Corporate 
 Security unit manages and controls the use of renewable 
energy in the BMW  Group buildings. A steering group is 
responsible for coordinating current and future measures 
and for evaluating regularly whether the targets are being 
achieved.  We have defined independent  processes  through -
out the Group for the planning and implementation of 
measures, which assign clear roles and responsibilities to 
the central strategy departments, regional control stations 
as well as plants at the local level. 
Furthermore, the BMW  Group works in close cooperation 
with its energy suppliers in the local markets in order to be 
able to respond to any changes in the supplied electricity 
quality in terms of the green electricity share and CO 2 
freight. 
Changes in the relevant regulations often present us with 
great challenges, as they make long-term planning more 
difficult.  The monitoring  process, also with external  sup-
port, helps the BMW  Group to respond to corresponding 
developments  at an early stage in order to find both tech-
nically and economically as well as politically viable solu -
tions.

SUPPLY CHAIN
Sustainability goal:
The BMW  Group will significantly increase supply chain 
transparency and resource efficiency by 2020
Environmental and social standards being adhered to along 
the entire value chain is of the utmost importance for the 
BMW  Group and its stakeholders. Since our network of ap -
proximately 12,000 suppliers accounts for around 80% of our 
value creation, it is vitally important that it uses resources ef -
ficiently and safeguards social standards. The increasing com -
plexity of the supply chains presents us with great challeng -
es. With electromobility consistently expanding, our demand 
for raw materials is changing. These specialised supply 
chains can carry particular environmental and social risks. 
Therefore, we work closely with our direct suppliers in order 
to make our supply chains more transparent. • GRI  102 -9
In addition, the BMW  Group increasingly supports initiatives 
for standardising sustainability requirements and introduc -
ing monitoring mechanisms, for example in mining and pro -
cessing critical raw materials. We are convinced that only con -
tinuous and collaborative supplier development and consis -
tent supplier management will increase resource efficiency 
and foster compliance with environmental and social stand -
ards. With our measures along the supply chain we want to 
contribute towards fulfilling SDG s 8 (Decent work and eco -
nomic growth), 10 (Reduced inequalities) and 12 (Responsible 
consumption and production).Key measures:
Integrating and advancing sustainability in the  
supply chains
The due diligence process is at the heart of how we imple -
ment our sustainability requirements in the supply chains. 
As a pioneer in the automotive sector, we have made sus -
tainability an integral part of our procurement process since 
2014 . Our sustainability requirements apply to all suppliers 
of production materials as well as service providers.
We identified  raw materials  and other materials  that are 
particularly critical in terms of sustainability as early as 
2012 . Since then, we have analysed the impact of these re -
sources on the environment and society along the entire 
supply chain and we carry out pilot projects to increase 
sustainability performance. We use our experiences from 
these projects in the • Drive Sustainability  and • Responsible 
Minerals  initiatives as well as other programmes. The aim is 
to drive the standardisation of sustainability requirements 
as strongly as possible along the entire supply chain.  
In 2017 , an analysis of the most important raw materials 
was carried out at the European company network CSR  
Eur ope at the suggestion of the BMW  Group and with the 
support of the other nine carmakers who form part of the 
Drive Sustainability initiative. The results were published 
in the 2018  • Material Change Report  by the two standardisa -
tion initiatives mentioned above as well as • The Dragonfly 
 Initiative . The report identified  and evaluated  opportunities  
and risks in terms of sustainability for 18 key raw materials 
used in vehicle production. It is intended as a basis to be 
used to discuss potential for improvement in order to sup -
port the development of joint solutions in the automotive 
and electronics sectors. In this context, in 2018  we have 
looked in particular at steel, aluminium, cobalt, copper and 
natural rubber and the specific supply chains of the conflict 
minerals tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold. We have already 
made significant  progress  in this area.  • Other topics with

Appendix·
Combined separate non-financial reportIn 2018 , we initiated a working group in collaboration with 
other companies from the automotive sector in order to 
further advance the implementation of the CDP  Supply 
Chain Programme along the entire supply chain. In this 
group we exchange experiences and viewpoints and joint -
ly hold information events for suppliers.
Due diligence processes:
Increasing transparency and minimising risks
The increase  of transparency  and resource  efficiency  in 
our supply chains is based on compliance with environ -
mental and social standards  as defined in the  • BMW  Group 
sustainability standard for the supplier network.  The standard is an 
integral part of the application documents for suppliers 
and must be taken into account at the time of preparing an 
offer. In addition,  all supplier agreements  concluded  by the 
BMW  Group for materials required for production as well 
as for materials not required for production contain spe -
cific clauses in the  • purchasing conditions.  These conditions 
are based on the principles of the • UN Global Compact  and 
the  • International Labour Organization (ILO) • GRI  412 -3 and 
contain specifications  for resource  efficiency.  When they 
sign the contract, our suppliers also commit to ensuring 
that their own suppliers in turn comply with these agree -
ments. Our employees in Strategic Purchasing are respon -
sible for sustainability topics concerning the supply chain. 
We use due diligence processes to monitor the implemen -
tation of sustainability standards at our suppliers.In 2018 , the BMW  Group was nominated as a member of 
the OECD  stakeholder group. During the various talks 
and discussions, we brought our experiences with cobalt 
as a raw material to the table and contributed some valu -
able ideas for making sustainability criteria part of the 
procurement process. In addition, we joined the cross-sec -
tor initiative • Responsible Business Alliance  (RBA ). In our 
“supporter”  role, we investigate  how suppliers  can be audit -
ed more efficiently  and campaign  for more efficiency  in the 
supply chains. Furthermore, we were elected to the Board 
of the Responsible Minerals Initiative in 2018 , a subsidiary 
organisation of RBA . This organisation, which had ori -
ginally been concerned  exclusively  with conflict minerals,  
is now increasingly opening up to other critical materials 
and thus provides us with an opportunity to utilise proven 
tools and methods in our key supply chains.
In addition, we worked on the pilot for a joint auditing pro -
gramme as part of a specific working group of the German 
Association of the Automotive Industry ( VDA ), which was 
chaired by the BMW  Group. The aim is to make results of 
audits that were carried out or initiated by one VDA  mem -
ber available to other members.
Addressing resource efficiency and CO 2 emissions at our 
suppliers
By encouraging them to participate in the Carbon Dis -
closure Project’s ( CDP ) • Supply Chain Programme , we support 
our suppliers  in their efforts to reduce the impact of their 
business activities on the climate. The annual reports for 
the programme take a large number of aspects into ac -
count: from making climate protection part of the compa -
ny strategy to actively managing potential risks. In this 
context, measures for reducing CO 2 emissions and increas -
ing the share of renewable energy play an important role. 
The  reporting  results in an overall evaluation  reflecting  the 
 increase  in resource  efficiency  and the reduction  of emis -
sions. It is our aim that 60% of our suppliers participating 
in the CDP  Supply Chain Programme achieve at least a B 
rating by 2020  (A is the highest and D is the lowest rating 
in terms of implementing the CDP  criteria).

Increase in transparency due to the  
CDP  Supply Chain Programme
In 2018 , a total of 190 of our suppliers ( 2017: 189) reported 
their resource  efficiency  through  the CDP  Supply Chain 
Programme. These suppliers account for 75% of the 
production-  relevant purchase volume of the BMW  Group 
(2017: 77%). The decrease is due to the fact that some large 
suppliers did not submit reports. 
As in the previous year, our participating suppliers, includ -
ing the 20 companies that entered the programme in 2018 , 
achieved an average rating of C. 30% achieved a rating of B 
and higher ( 2017: 25%). There have been significant  im-
provements at suppliers who have been reporting for at 
least three years. We regard this as evidence that the pro -
gramme is well established at the companies that have 
been participating for longer periods and that it yields the 
expected results.
Participating suppliers reduced their CO 2 emissions by 
39 million t in 2018  (2017: 34 million t). This was mainly 
due to two larger divestments, renewable energy projects 
and an increase  in energy efficiency.
The positive results that have been achieved thus far by the 
programme  would seem to indicate  that our efforts to in-
crease transparency  and resource  efficiency  in the supply 
chain are effective.Results and performance indicators:
Relevant supplier locations evaluated
In the period under review, we assessed 4,168 (2017 : 4,886) 
nominated and potential supplier locations on the basis of 
the industry-wide sustainability questionnaire. Our focus 
is on suppliers with a large tendering volume. Therefore, 
the evaluation included 97% (2017 : 94%) of suppliers of ma -
terials required for production with a tendering volume of 
more than € 2 million from BMW  AG, as well as 80% (2017 : 
77%) of new suppliers of materials that are not required for 
production  with a tendering  volume of more than € 10 mil-
lion from BMW  AG.  • GRI  308 -1, 412 -1, 414 -1 
Sustainability  deficits were identified  at 2,320 potential and 
existing supplier locations, for example in the area of en -
vironmental management or with regard to a human rights 
policy not being in place at the company in question. Cor -
rective measures  to remedy the sustainability  deficits were 
 defined for 1,123 of those cases.
In our terms and conditions of purchase for materials 
 required for production and in our general contract terms for 
materials not required for production, we stipulate the 
 requirement  for a certified  environmental  management  sys-
tem according to ISO 14001  or EMAS . In addition, 79 audits 
and ten assessments were carried out by or on behalf of the 
BMW  Group in 2018. Crucial areas of action identified  by 
 audits and assessments have been highlighted, particularly 
in the areas of hazardous substance management, waste 
management and working conditions or occupational safety.  
• GRI  308 -1, 308 -2, 414 -1, 414 -2
A total of 193 supplier locations were not commissioned 
because they did not meet the sustainability requirements 
of the BMW  Group, among other things. We did not, how -
ever, terminate any existing cooperation in 2018 . We re -
gard this as confirmation  of the success of our approach  of 
addressing and demanding sustainability requirements 
early on in the procurement process. • GRI  308 -2, 414 -2• see

and which we officially  joined after it was formalised  in 
the reporting period. The objective of this initiative is to 
increase the level of transparency and to implement meas -
ures pertaining to overcoming social and environmental 
risks in the cobalt supply chain. In collaboration with the 
Responsible Minerals Initiative and the Chinese Chamber 
of Commerce ( CCCMC ), we developed an auditing stan -
dard and an auditing  process for refineries  and smelters, 
which are being validated  and further refined by means of 
pilot audits in 2018  and 2019 .
In addition, we have, in collaboration with partner com -
panies from our supply chain, commissioned the German development agency Gesellschaft für Internationale 
Zusammenarbeit (
GIZ) to run a three-year project to in -
vestigate how working and living conditions in small-scale mining in the Democratic Republic of Congo can be im -
proved. The project focuses on a pilot mine where cobalt 
is extracted using artisanal methods. The pilot project, 
which is 
100% privately funded was set up to test ap -
proaches for improving the working and living conditions for miners and the people in the surrounding commu -
nities. If the project is successful, these approaches can then 
also be used for other artisanal mines in the long term.
Copper
With the electrification  of our fleet, the demand  for copper 
is also on the rise, since large amounts of the material are 
contained in the vehicles’ electrical systems as well as the 
high-voltage battery and the drivetrain. Therefore, in this supply chain as well, we want to address potential negative 
effects on the environment  and society. We collaborate  with 
the state-owned Chilean copper producer Codelco and are 
committed to increasing transparency in the copper supply 
chain and ensuring sustainability from mine to production 
line. To this end, we are working in collaboration with the copper industry, representatives from civil society and end 
consumers to establish a cross-industry initiative that will 
develop a sustainability standard for copper.Other topics with strategic relevance
Action taken on selected raw materials
Steel and aluminium
In terms of weight, steel and aluminium make up the largest 
share of materials used in our vehicles. Therefore, we are 
consistently  looking for ways to increase  efficiency  and 
transparency in the supply chains and to ensure that we 
source our materials in an environmentally friendly and so -
cially viable manner.
As a founding member of the Aluminium Stewardship Ini -
tiative ( ASI), we have helped define the standard  for a trans -
parent and sustainable supply chain from mine to vehicle 
from the outset (Performance Standard, Chain of Custody). 
We are currently  working  on getting certification  for our 
own manufacturing processes and those of our suppliers.
We have also been supporting the formalisation of the Re -
sponsible Steel Initiative ( RSI) for a long time and we are 
actively contributing towards developing a sustainability 
standard.  This year, we have joined the initiative  officially  
in order to meet our responsibilities.
Cobalt
Another relevant raw material is cobalt, a key component 
in the production  of electrified  vehicles.  Large amounts  of 
cobalt are contained in batteries of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. As cobalt mining is associated with high risks, in particular in terms of human rights, we are work -
ing towards establishing maximum transparency in the supply chain. We are in constant contact with our sup -
pliers and, for some years now, we have asked them to dis -
close the origin of this raw material. At the end of 
2017 , 
we made information on smelters and countries of origin 
of cobalt • available to the public , and we update this on a 
regular basis.  
We are also a founding member of the Responsible Cobalt 
Initiative ( RCI), where we are represented on the Board 85

training, information and support for the suppliers. In or -
der to improve our understanding of the processes in the 
mineral-processing sector, we  visited selected European 
smelting works in 2018 .In addition, we have set up a pilot project with DRÄXL -
MAIER  Group, one of our suppliers, to make the copper 
supply chain for the vehicles’ electrical system more trans -
parent. Together with our partners from the supply chain 
we are using supply chain mapping to thoroughly analyse all steps along the chain. We utilise the transparency that 
we gain in this way in order to identify and manage sus -
tainability risks and opportunities.
Natural rubber
Fostering sustainability in the natural rubber supply 
chains, a raw material which is mainly used in tyre 
 products, is also particularly important to us. The 
BMW  Group initiated talks with suppliers and NGO s on 
this topic as early as 2015 . Since then, we have been seek -
ing opportunities for dialogue and collaboration with the 
relevant stakeholders in this sector in order to establish a 
multi-stakeholder initiative on this topic. Our objective is to make consensus decisions and come up with joint 
solutions. In April 
2018 , the BMW  Group hosted a round 
table, organised by Drive Sustainability, on the topic of sustainable natural rubber for representatives from civil 
society, tyre manufacturers, carmakers and representa -
tives from standardisation organisations.

uses the relevant OECD  Due Diligence Guidance. In 
view of the EU Conflict  Minerals  Regulation,  which is set 
to come into force on 21 January 2021 , we want to foster 
transparency with regard to the origins of minerals. In 
this context we are focusing initially on the BMW  Group

HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE
Sustainability goal:
To preserve the health and the performance of its employees 
in the long term, the BMW  Group promotes personal respon -
sibility and an appropriately designed work environment 
Our employees are the BMW  Group’s most important suc -
cess factor. Maintaining their health and performance is 
therefore a top priority for us. High demands are sometimes 
placed on employees at work, and, what's more, there is often 
additional mental stress. As an employer, the BMW  Group 
has to be able to react flexibly to changes in lifestyles and the 
needs of an ageing society. Our occupational health and safe -
ty concept therefore includes a holistic health management 
programme, work safety and er gonomics, ageing-appropriate 
work systems and a wide  variety of healthy food in our can -
teens. These programmes also help us contribute towards 
achieving SDG s 3 (Good health and well-being for people) 
and 8 (Decent work and economic growth).Key measures:
Promoting health
Since 2011, our “Health Initiative”  has been coordinating  
the measures to promote the health and performance of 
our employees in the three areas of health management, 
work safety and ergonomics as well as corporate catering. 
As part of this initiative, we have developed an extensive 
prevention and rehabilitation programme covering the 
 areas of nutrition, exercise, relaxation and addiction pre -
vention. International campaigns are designed to promote 
health awareness among employees – in 2018 , for example, 
under the headings  “Burn what you eat” and “Keep mov-
ing”. In addition,  we hold campaign  days, dialogue  events, 
courses and training for executives in order to regularly in -
form our employees about current health topics such as 
cancer prevention, the dangers of addiction, and resilience.
And since 2014 , the “Health Management 2020” (GM  2020 ) 
programme has been running in collaboration with the 
company’s doctors. It is designed to strengthen employee’s 
sense of individual responsibility and to provide a work 
environment that meets the respective requirements for 
optimal health and performance. The programme includes 
a health check-up and an employee survey about their 
working environment. Subsequently, participants receive 
an extensive personal medical report and have the option 
of consulting a physician for advice on any preventive 
measures required. In Germany, for example, we had com -
piled around 28,500 personal medical reports by the end 
of 2018 . Internationally, too, the Health Management 2020  
programme forms the basis for prevention measures within 
the respective country’s local conditions.
After the check-up, the participating employees’ depart -
ments receive an anonymous overall report laying out the 
relevant health aspects and information on how to struc -
ture the working environment. By the end of 2018, around 
750 reports had been compiled for the various departments 
of the company.  While they do not allow identification  of any 
individual person, they do help to determine general areas 
for improvement. Introduction

Combined separate non-financial reportEnabling long-term employment
A workforce that is increasing in average age brings with it 
new health challenges. Our “Today for Tomorrow > NEXT”, 
programme, which started to be introduced company-wide 
in 2018 , is helping to ensure that our employees remain 
healthy and able to work as they age. The programme fo -
cuses on muscular-skeletal disease as well as physical indi -
cations.  It includes measures for employees and executives 
in the four action areas of prevention, ergonomics, manage -
ment of employee’s work and leadership. In Germany, the 
programme additionally includes a prevention and integra -
tion process that integrates employees with health limita -
tions as best as possible into the work processes.
Due diligence processes:
Evaluating risks and implementing measures  
at our locations
The BMW  Group carries out comprehensive risk manage -
ment in the area of occupational health and safety. • GRI  102 -11 
For example, the health check-ups of the Health Management 
2020  programme help with prevention. At present, 27 of our 
31 production locations have occupational health and safety 
management  systems certified according  to OHRIS  (Occupa -
tional Health and Risk Management System) or OHSAS  
18001  (Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series). 
Both systems are designed to reduce risk of injury and acci -
dent and prevent work-related illness. In addition, occupa -
tional health and safety committees with representation from 
both the employer and employee sides are active at almost all 
BMW  Group locations, making continuous improvements in 
health and safety standards at the workplace. • GRI  403 -4 89.2% 
of employees are represented on the occupational health 
and safety committees, for example by union representa -
tives ( 2017 : 88.4%). This figure also includes  temporary  
workers, interns, thesis students working at the company 
as well as doctoral candidates. • GRI  403 -1As an evaluation of the Health Management 2020  pro -
gramme carried out in 2017  was positive, we continued to 
implement it in 2018 .
Managing occupational health and safety
At all of our locations, we continually evaluate and im -
prove work safety on the basis of certifications,  through 
health and safety committees, and with the help of risk as -
sessments such as the Safety and Ergonomics Risk Assess -
ment system ( SERA ). This system was introduced in 2016  
and expanded by 2018  to a total of twelve locations world -
wide.
In order to avoid accidents  even more effectively,  a “Be-
haviour Based Safety” project was piloted in 2017  in the 
corporate catering area of the Research and Innovation 
Centre in Munich / DE.  This project entails an extensive  
training programme for executives and employees, during 
which they are supported by a trainer in analysing risks in 
their working area and defining  long-term  accident  pre-
vention measures. After the successful pilot phase and a 
decrease in accident numbers, corporate catering began to 
implement the project at the Munich plant in 2018 . 
An analysis of accidents at the BMW  Group dealerships 
showed that most occupational accidents in the workshops 
result in cuts or bruises. In 2018  we therefore introduced 
a campaign to prevent these types of injury. 
It is of the utmost importance to us that all third-party 
companies that are present at the BMW  Group locations 
work as safely as possible. Safe collaboration with contract -
ors is regulated by the contractor declaration, which de -
termines risks and derives protective measures from the 
first day of work onwards.  In addition,  all employees  of ex-
ternal companies who are working on the large construc -
tion sites receive safety instruction above and beyond the 
statutory stipulations from a specialist BMW  trainer (on 
smaller construction sites this is the task of the external 
company).93

The success of our efforts is demonstrated  by the accident

ness rate) and the number of days missed.
Further reduction in accident frequency
Accident frequency was further reduced, with 3.5 accidents 
per one million hours worked ( 2017 : 3.6). On-site occupa -
tional health and safety management systems, the continu -
ous improvement of safety conditions in the workplace as 
well as targeted safety training are decisive factors for this 
success. By 2015 , we had already attained the target we set 
in 2011  to reduce this rate to below 4.5 worldwide by 2020 , 
thus more than halving it.  • GRI  403 -2

tal stress experienced at the workplace by conducting obser -
vational interviews. The risk analysis in production plants 
and in production-adjacent  areas was simplified  by 
the  SERA risk analysis. Further measures  include the office 
workstation analysis ( BAPA ) and the central logging system 
for environmentally relevant substances ( ZEUS ). 
The right to health and safety at the workplace is a key com -
ponent of our new • BMW  Group Code on Human Rights and Work -
ing Conditions . In it, the BMW  Group undertakes to consist -
ently comply with the currently applicable occupational 
health and safety legislation worldwide and in addition to 
set its own standards for improving occupational safety.  
All issues within the company  that affect occupational  
health and safety are consolidated within the “Work Envir -
onment and Health” unit, which is part of our Human 
 Resources portfolio within the Board of Management.  
Internationally, occupational health and safety manage -
ment is under the charge of regional  hubs at the different  
locations. In general, the on-site managers are responsible 
for all operational processes. The health management and 
 occupational health and safety teams (company doctors, 
medical assistants,  safety experts and officers)  support 
and advise the respective departments in carrying out the 
statutory tasks involved in occupational health and safety.94

The number of days of absence, which has been consoli  dated 
at BMW  Group level since 2017  and maps the degree of 
 severity of accidents (number of days of absence due to an 
occupational accident per one million working hours), in -
creased slightly compared to the previous year ( 2017: 68.7, 
2018 : 71.3). • GRI  403 -2 Based on the slight change of 3.8%, we 
cannot currently identify any trend in accident severity at the 
BMW  Group.
The sickness rate (number of hours of absenteeism due to ill -
ness, divided by the contractually agreed number of hours 
to be worked) was 4.9%* (2017: 4.6%), slightly higher than in 
the previous years. However, as in the previous years, the

Graphic G 4.03 shows the main activities during which 
accidents occur at the BMW  Group. It shows that most 
accidents happen while employees are walking or doing 
assembly and dismantling work. Walking accidents can 
result in injuries such as concussions, fractures, sprains 
and contusions. To counteract this, we continued to im -
plement the BMW Group “safe walking”  campaign  
launched in 2016 . In 2018 , we launched a campaign at 
the dealerships to reduce accidents that could lead to 
cuts and bruises during assembly and dismantling work. 
This includes employee and manager surveys (before 
and after the campaign), communication materials (such as flyers and posters)  as well as one-day  workshops  on 
behaviour-related occupational safety with the master 
craftspeople  and safety officers at the dealerships.

this, we are also fulfilling our commitment to SDG s 4 (High-  
quality education) and 8 (Decent work and economic growth).
Especially in these times of digitalisation and technological 
change, it is vital for the BMW  Group to be an attractive em -
ployer. The company is facing considerable challenges in 
terms of increasing competition with leading technology 
companies, a global scarcity of qualified technical workers 
and demographic change. With this in mind, it is essential 
for us to invest in our employees, to offer them opportunities 
and to fos ter con tinuous learning. This approa ch to long-
term employee development helps us to fulfil this vision.Key measures:
Offering attractive overall remuneration
We aim to ensure that the total remuneration package is 
above the average for the respective labour market. To ver -
ify this, we carry out annual remuneration studies world -
wide. The total compensation package is made up of month -
ly remuneration, a variable compensation component and a 
wide range of additional  benefits,  such as a company   
pension. 
The same remuneration policies apply for all of the 
BMW  Group companies – regardless of employees’ gender, 
religion, origin, age, disability, sexual orientation or coun -
try-specific  characteristics.  Our remuneration  policy is thus 
an integral part of a consistent and transparent process of 
employee development.  • GRI  401 -2
Encouraging work-life balance
The working hours that function best for employees vary 
depending on what phase of life they are in, their individ -
ual life plans and their work situation. For this reason, the 
BMW Group offers all employees  a range of options to help 
them find the right work-life  balance – for example through 
flexible working  hours, sabbaticals  or mobile working.  In 
addition,  we have for many years been offering employees 
family support services.
Offering a wide range of training and further  
education options
The BMW  Group also invests on an ongoing basis in train -
ing its employees and fostering their talents. This lets us 
ensure that they have the skills needed to keep pace with 
future challenges. We follow the principle of life-long learn -
ing with a focus on the digital transformation. Thus, our 
medium-term goal is to switch to agile working and leader -
ship methods.  • GRI  404 -2100

Combined separate non-financial reportSurveying employees, achieving improvements
We want our employees to identify with the company and 
to translate their passion into top performance each and 
every day. We therefore conduct an employee survey every 
two years to identify potential for improvement.
Due diligence processes:
Systematically identifying and managing need for action
Our • BMW  Group Code on Human Rights and Working Conditions , 
published  for the first time in 2018 , sets down our prin -
ciple of exceeding minimum standards with regard to our 
working conditions.
The BMW  Group has established a strategic process for 
human resources planning in recent years in order to de -
tect new skills required at the company in good time and 
promptly  find the right people for the tasks at hand. This 
process takes place every year, and is steered by the 
“Group Human  Resources,  Strategy  and Goals” depart -
ment. The planning results serve as a basis for the system -
atic alignment and success tracking of our training and 
further education programmes as well as relevant HR 
tools such as personnel marketing, recruitment and 
young talent programmes.  
In order to ensure gender parity in remuneration, the 
BMW  Group has established a monitoring process that 
compares the monthly pay of men and women based on 
the categories of full-time, part-time, pay grade and age. 
The analysis carried out in the year 2018  found no signif -
icant differences  between  the overall compensation  pack -
ages of women and men. • GRI  405 -2 Vocational training at the BMW  Group is being redesigned 
worldwide  due to digitalisation  and the spread of electrifica -
tion. In addition to three new vocational training occupa -
tions in the areas of IT and electronics, training year 2018  
saw the introduction of twelve STEM -subject bachelor’s 
 degrees in the German dual system ( STEM : sciences, tech -
nology, engineering,  mathematics).  We modified  the content 
of the existing 27 vocational occupations to focus on the fu -
ture topics of big data analytics, agile development methods, 
robotics as well as smart production and logistics. Our long-
term need for skilled workers in the company is being served 
by the introduction of new skill sets, modern equipment and 
innovative teaching methods.
To foster young talent, in addition to its regular scholar -
ship programmes, the BMW Group offers entry to highly 
talented graduates via the Global Leader Development 
Programme.  It focuses among other things on teaching 
personal, professional and intercultural as well as team 
and collaboration  skills. The programme  is offered at the 
BMW  Group locations worldwide.
In 2018 , we considerably expanded our range of specialist 
training courses. Here, the focus was on new skill set areas 
such as data analytics.
Fundamentally, our aim is to develop leaders who stand out 
as much for their personal initiative as for their ability to 
work well with others to successfully manage teams and 
build networks.  To achieve this, we continuously  refine our 
training programmes for executives and have added new 
courses focusing  on “Leadership  in the digital age”.
In addition, every BMW  Group employee receives a consist -
ent and comprehensive performance and behaviour review 
at least once a year in order to support their individual devel -
opment. • GRI  404 -3101

Unions and collective bargaining
As laid down in the • BMW  Group Code on Human Rights and 
Working Conditions , the company recognises the rights of all 
employees to set up employee representation and carry 
out collective bargaining to regulate working conditions. 
At the BMW  Group, institutionalised co-determination is 
implemented Group-wide according to the applicable 
 national regulations. At all BMW  AG plants and dealer -
ships as well as in Austria and the UK, elected works 
councils observe co-determination for the employees. In 
China and South Africa, employees are represented by  local workers’ councils. At locations that have no workers’ 
representatives, the 
BMW  Group encourages regular dia -
logue between employees and the company.The BMW  Group complies with conventions 87 and 98 of 
the ILO (International Labour Organization), which guar -
antee workers freedom of association and the right to col -
lective bargaining. This also includes the right to establish 
and to join independent C 93 trade unions and other advo -
cacy organisations as well as protection against discrimi -
nation on the grounds of membership in an employee rep -
resentative body. Freedom of association is thus one of the principles set down in the •
 Joint Declaration on Human Rights 
and Working Conditions at the BMW  Group . The timely and com -
prehensive involvement of employee representatives is en -
sured in the BMW  Group by the Supervisory Board of 
BMW  AG with equal representation of all parties as well 
as by works councils and local employee representatives.

Combined separate non-financial reportKey measures: 
Promoting diversity and equal opportunity in the company 
The • BMW  Group Code on Human Rights and Working Conditions , 
published in 2018 , declares that equal treatment of all em -
ployees is a fundamental principle of our corporate policy. 
The Diversity Concept for the BMW  Group workforce 
passed by our Board of Management in 2010 defines three 
dimensions where diversity is to be strengthened Group-
wide while taking due consideration of local conditions: 
gender, cultural background,  age/experience.
The BMW  Group focuses for this purpose on event and dia -
logue formats designed to raise awareness of diversity issues 
among managers and employees. We also take measures in 
the areas of recruitment and human resources development 
to foster diversity and equal opportunity throughout the com -
pany. In addition,  we develop formats that address different 
target groups in specific company  portfolios  and divisions.  
For example, female production managers take part in a spe -
cial onboarding programme when they join the company. 
In 2018  a special focus was placed on communications and 
events. We developed for example a new communications 
concept to draw attention throughout the year to the topic of 
diversity.
Diversity-promoting concepts were also developed for the 
management boards (Board of Management and Supervisory 
Board). We report in detail on these concepts and their imple -
mentation in our • Annual Report 2018. 
To further promote an international perspective and inter -
cultural understanding among our new employees, we de -
signed our young talent programmes such as the “Global 
Leader Development  Programme”  with the needs of inter -
national participants in mind. We also focus on recruiting 
managers with international experience, while working to 
increase the share of employees of non-German origin in 
the long term.4.3  
DIVERSITY
Sustainability goal: 
Through its diverse workforce, the BMW  Group increases 
its competitiveness and enhances its innovative strength
Modern society is characterised by a variety of different back -
grounds and lifestyles. The BMW  Group is aware of its social 
responsibility as an employer to promote equal opportunities 
in an increasingly versatile society through a diverse work -
force. As a global enterprise, the BMW  Group regards an 
 intercultural workforce, an appropriate gender balance and a 
good age mix as very beneficial to our business. We are con -
vinced that a diverse workforce increases our innovative 
strength and further enhances our competitiveness, for exam -
ple by helping us to better understand customers’ needs. The 
action we are taking in this area is also designed to achieve 
SDG s 5 (Gender equality) and 10 (Reduced inequalities).110

Further increase in diversity in the company
We have been able to increase the proportion of women in 
the total workforce from 19.3% (2017 ) to 19.9% (2018 ). This 
is above our self-imposed target range of 15–17%. The 
share of female managers in the BMW  Group rose to 17.2% 
(2017 : 16.0%). In the young talent groups, the proportion of

Due diligence processes:
Counteracting discrimination through clear policies and 
grievance mechanisms
The BMW  Group Legal Compliance Code prohibits dis -
crimination of any sort. Employees can address related 
queries to their own managers,  the relevant  offices of the 
BMW  Group, the HR department or the works council. The 
BMW  Group SpeakUP Line, a telephone hotline available 
in over 30 languages, furthermore gives our employees 
worldwide  a way to anonymously  and confidentially  report 
possible breaches of the Legal Compliance Code.
In addition,  a grievance  office for discrimination,  staffed based 
on equal representation,  was installed at our Munich / DE  loca-
tion in 2018. This provides employees with a downstream pro -
cedure so that they can track the progress of their grievance.

The BMW  Group will continue to pursue an integrated  
diversity strategy  – in particular with regard to gender, 
age and cultural background. The measures already imple -
mented will be continued  and intensified  next year.In the area of cultural diversity,  we continue  to benefit from 
the great variety of cultural backgrounds in our workforce. 
In 2018 , employees from a total of 124 countries were work -
ing together successfully at BMW  AG alone ( 2017 : 118 coun -
tries). When it comes to securing talent for the future, we 
 also take an international approach: young people from 
eight countries took part in the Global Leader Development 
Programme that fosters young talent.
We also continued to promote age diversity in 2018 . At 
BMW  AG1 the share of employees over the age of 50 in-
creased from 28.3% (2017 ) to 29.1%. This is the result not 
only of demographic  change but also of our efforts to sup-
port age(ing)-appropriate working conditions. • GRI 405-1

CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP
Sustainability goal: 
The BMW  Group is a leader in intercultural understanding
Effective corporate citizenship forms an integral part of the 
BMW  Group’s vision of itself as a business enterprise. As a 
global company, we take responsibility and address current 
issues in society, focusing on areas where we can best bring 
our competencies to bear to achieve measurable improve -
ments. We are convinced that our activities contribute to over -
coming societal challenges while also creating added value for 
the company. This is accomplished, for example, by imple -
menting new ideas that arise when a variety of social stake -
holders work together. Experiences thus gained can also go 
 towards strengthening innovation in our core business. With 
our projects, we also want to make a contribution towards 
achieving the SDG s, specifically SDG  4 (High-quality educa -
tion), 5 (Gender equality), 8 ( D e c e n t  w o r k  a n d  e c o n o m i c  
growth), 10 (Reduced inequalities) as well as 17 (Partnerships 
to achieve the goals).
Key measures:
Actively promoting intercultural understanding and 
 social inclusion
Corporate citizenship at the BMW  Group focuses on long-
term solutions that are internationally transferable and 
bring lasting results according to the principle of “helping 
people to help themselves”.  We therefore  concentrate  on 
our core competencies: intercultural understanding and 
social inclusion.  
As a global corporation with a multinational workforce, the 
BMW  Group has a vital interest in tolerance and under -standing  between  different  nations,  religions  and ethnic 
groups. With the annual • Intercultural Innovation Award , we 
collaborate with the • United Nations Alliance of Civilizations 
 (UNAOC ) to recognise innovative projects that pursue solu -
tions to intercultural  tensions  and conflict.  The winning  
individuals and initiatives receive support in the form of 
both a grant and expert advice. The main focus here is on 
projects that promote gender equality.
Globally, the BMW  Group fosters social inclusion through 
education projects – from primary level right through to 
higher education. We make a lasting contribution to more 
equality of opportunity by helping disadvantaged young 
people to gain entry to the labour market. We conduct cor -
responding projects at our company locations that are tai -
lored to the respective local needs – in 2018  in such coun -
tries as the USA , Thailand, India, Brazil, Mexico, China, 
Korea and Germany.  
One example  of this is the “Joy Home” initiative  of the 
BMW  Warm Heart Fund in China. This initiative was set 
up so that we can provide facilities for children who live 
far away from their parents – e. g. if the parents are work -
ing in other provinces. Thanks to a modern education pro -
gramme combined with plenty of games and sports activ -
ities, we aim to bolster the physical and mental health of 
the children who have been left behind and to equip them 
for the future. Our “Livelihood  for Youth” in India teaches 
young people English and basic computer skills so that 
they can realise their potential on the labour market. The 
BMW  Araquari plant in Brazil runs a social and leisure 
centre where children up to nine years of age receive 
meals and educational support. In England, the “ BMW  
Edu cation” programme  gives children  and adolescents  in-
sights into sustainable  mobility  of the future. And finally, 
in the “Young Engineers  Dream” programme  in South 
 Korea, BMW  and MINI  engineers share their knowledge 
and experience with senior pupils in technical secondary 
schools. The experts are also available to the pupils as 
mentors, working with them to develop life goals and 
 career plans. The one-year programme consists of month -
ly day-long workshops, mentor meetings, basic training at 
the BMW  Group Korea Trainings Academy, a visit to an 116

Appendix·
Combined separate non-financial reportWe want to make sure that our corporate citizenship ef -
forts address actual needs and have a lasting impact. With 
this in mind, the Corporate Citizenship department leads 
and coordinates the activities. It collaborates with the dif -
ferent locations in shaping and evaluating corporate citi -
zenship efforts. To obtain a complete  overview  of all activ -
ities, the department conducts an annual global survey in 
all relevant areas of the company.
Based in Munich / DE,  the department  also reviews the im-
pact of the BMW  Group as a whole with respect to corporate 
citizenship. Since 2010, the iooi (Input Output Outcome Im -
pact) method has been used for this purpose. By listing the 
resources deployed (inputs), the services provided (outputs), 
the results achieved  (outcomes)  and the effects attained  (im-
pacts), this method makes it possible to differentiate  corpor-
ate citizenship  activities according  to the effort involved and 
the benefits realised,  making their impact measurable  and 
demonstrable. This gives us a basis for evaluating and fur -
ther developing our projects. 
Results and performance indicators:
Further increase in people reached 
We regularly formulate clear objectives that allow us to 
meas  ure the impact of our sponsorship measures. For ex -
ample, between 2011  and 2025 , we want to reach six mil -
lion people through the diverse projects recognised by the 
Intercultural Innovation Award. We are on the right track. 
Between 2011  and the end of 2018 , we were able to help 
over 2.58 million people through the winning projects, 
meaning we had already reached over 43% of our target.automotive trade fair and even a trip to a BMW  plant in 
Germany. For further information, see the BMW  Group 
• website Corporate citizenship .
Fostering responsible leadership through the BMW  
Foundation Herbert Quandt 
We also foster responsible leadership through the BMW  
Foundation Herbert Quandt. This foundation encourages 
leaders worldwide to take on their responsibility to society 
in line with the Agenda 2030 . With its leadership pro -
grammes, its network of around 1,500 members and its 
investments, the foundation gives managers a platform 
for personal and professional engagement. The founda -
tion also uses its own budget to fund initiatives from the 
network as well as social organisations that achieve a 
proven and sustainable impact. Through the Eberhard 
von Kuenheim Fund, the foundation additionally invests 
a share of its core assets in realising  not only financial   
returns but also positive effects on society. For further in-
formation on the BMW  Foundation Herbert Quandt, see

Due diligence processes:
Avoiding risks by applying clear guidelines and systemat -
ically evaluating impact
The hallmarks of all of the corporate citizenship activities 
undertaken by the BMW  Group are transparency, compli -
ance with all statutory requirements as well as careful doc -
umentation of the measures taken. The BMW  Group pol -
icy on “Sponsorship,  donations  and memberships”  was 
drafted for this purpose in 2011 . It prescribes binding rules 
of conduct for all internal departments and locations of the

OUR REPORTING CONCEPT
The BMW  Group Sustainable Value Report ( SVR ) 2018  has 
been published to provide stakeholders with comprehensive 
information about the company’s sustainability strategy and 
the progress made in integrating sustainability into its corpo -
rate processes. The requirements of the German CSR Direc -
tive Implementation Act ( CSR  RUG ) obligate Bayerische  
Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft ( BMW  AG) to publish a 
non-financial report at company and Group level. This will 
be published as an integrated, separate non-financial Group 
report within this Sustainable Value Report. The legally  
required information1 will be provided in the chapter 
sub-sections on the beige-coloured pages. If information on -
ly applies to parts of the BMW  Group (e. g. to BMW  AG), this 
will be indicated. This report has been prepared in accord -
ance with the GRI Standards: Comprehensive option.   
• GRI  102 -54
1 Diversity Concept in Board of Management and Supervisory Board is contained in the Statement on Corporate 
Governance. • see Annual Report 2018CSR  Directive Implementation Act
Main topics
Based on the results of the materiality analysis updated in 
the year under review in accordance with the Global Report -
ing Initiative ( GRI) as well as the current long-term sustain -
ability goals of the BMW  Group, we derived the main topics 
to be complied with pursuant to the legislation. Both our 
own business activities, products and services as well as 
business  relationships,  e. g. along the supply chain, were 
 taken into consideration. The topics of high relevance are 
 presented  in the integrated,  separate  non-financial  report.
The order of the topics described is aligned with the long-
term sustainability goals of the BMW  Group and does not 
represent any particular weighting of the topics. An overview 
of the information on the main topics that is relevant to the 
legislation is presented at the beginning of each sub-  
section of the respective chapter. Here, in accordance with 
the statutory materiality requirements, we have compiled 
the information that in each case is required for an under -
standing  of the business  performance,  the financial  result 
and the current situation of the BMW  Group and which 
clearly expresses  the effects of business  activities  on the 
non-financial  aspects specified  in the legislation.
The main topics for the BMW Group’s financial  services 
were determined in 2017  by an internal workshop. They are 
described in  Chapter 1.4.
Risks
During the reporting process, we assessed whether any 
risks are associated with our own business activities, our 
business relationships and the products and services, 
which would very probably have, either currently or in the 
future, severe negative effects on the non-financial  aspects 
specified  in the legislation.  Based on this net-risk assess -
ment as well as the general legal requirement on selecting 
the main reporting content, we have no risks to report in 
the context of the CSR RUG .• see

Connection to figures in financial statements
For each topic, an assessment was carried out to identify 
any figures in the financial  statements  that are required  in 
order to understand  the combined  separate  non-financial  
report and are therefore to be reported and explained. The 
assessment concluded that no such information is required.

With the exception of the auditors of the legislation-relevant 
information – who were selected by the Supervisory Board 
of BMW  AG – the Corporate Reporting, Corporate Commu -
nications and Policy as well as Corporate Planning and 
Prod  uct Strategy departments selected the external auditors 
for the Sustainable Value Report. Ms Ursula Mathar, Head of 
Sustainability and Environmental Protection and Dr Thomas 
Becker, Vice President of Governmental and External 
 Affairs are responsible  for expert approval  of the SVR . 
Overall responsibility lies with the Board of the BMW  Group. 
The Supervisory Board is responsible for reviewing the CSR 
RUG -relevant information. The external auditors support 
the Supervisory  Board in fulfilling  its obligation  to under-
take audits within the context of the CSR RUG . 
References to information external to the report are consid -
ered additional information that is not part of the audit. 
Third-party auditing enables us to document for the public 
the reliability and trustworthiness of the information pro -
vided. In addition, we receive impetus for improvement 
and innovation in the reporting process. • GRI  102 -32, 102 -56121

Forward-looking statements
The BMW  Group Sustainable Value Report 2018  contains 
various forward-looking statements about future develop -
ments which are based on the current status of the 
BMW  Group’s assumptions and forecasts. They are thus 
subject to a variety of predictable and unpredictable risks, 
uncertainties and other factors, so that the actual outcome, 
including  the company’s  financial  and assets position,  its 
development  or performance  could differ considerably. 
The BMW  Group makes no commitment to update such 
forward-looking statements or to adapt them to future 
events or developments. 
The report is published in German and English. For rea -
sons of clarity and to avoid double references, generic 
references to the masculine in this document should be

Independent Practitioner’s Report on a Limited Assurance Engagement on Non-financial Reporting and  
Sustainability Information1
To BMW  AG, Munich 
We have performed a limited assurance engagement on the sustain -
ability disclosures (hereinafter the “Sustainability Information”) and 
the combined separate non-financial report pursuant to §§ (Articles) 
289b Abs. (paragraph) 3 and 315b Abs. 3 HGB (“Handelsgesetzbuch”: 
“German Commercial Code”) (hereinafter the “Non-financial Report”) 
contained therein and highlighted in color before the respective chap -
ters in the “Sustainable Value Report” of BMW AG, Munich (hereinafter 
the “Company”) for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2018 
(hereinafter the “Sustainable Value Report”).  
Responsibilities of the Executive Directors 
The executive directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation 
of the Sustainability Information in accordance with the principles stated 
in the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative 
(hereinafter the “GRI-Criteria”) and the Non-financial Report in accor -
dance with §§ 315b and 315c in conjunction with 289b to 289e HGB.
This responsibility of Company’s executive directors includes the selection 
and application of appropriate methods of sustainability reporting and 
non-financial reporting as well as making assumptions and estimates  
related to individual non-financial disclosures which are reasonable in the 
circumstances. Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for 
such internal control as they have considered necessary to enable the 
preparation of the Sustainable Value Report that is free from material  
misstatement whether due to fraud or error.
Independence and Quality Control of the Audit Firm
We have complied with the German professional provisions regarding 
independence as well as other ethical requirements.
Our audit firm applies the national legal requirements and professional 
standards – in particular the Professional Code for German Public Auditors 
and German Chartered Auditors (“Berufssatzung für Wirtschaftsprüfer 
und vereidigte Buchprüfer” : “BS WP/vBP”) as well as the Standard on 
Quality Control 1 published by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute 
of Public Auditors in Germany; IDW): Requirements to quality control for 
audit firms (IDW Qualitätssicherungsstandard 1: Anforderungen an die Qualitätssicherung in der Wirtschaftsprüferpraxis – IDW QS 1) – and  
accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control includ -
ing documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with  
ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements.
Practitioner’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the 
Sustainability Information in the Sustainable Value Report and the  
 information in the Non-financial Report based on the assurance  
engagement we have performed. 
Within the scope of our engagement we did not perform an audit on 
external sources of in-formation or expert opinions, referred to in the 
Sustainable Value Report.
We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with the  
International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000  
(Revised): Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of 
Historical Financial Information, issued by the IAASB. This Standard 
requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement to allow 
us to conclude with limited assurance that nothing has come to our  
attention that causes us to believe that 
– the Sustainability Information in the Sustainable Value Report for 
the period from 1 January to 31 December 2018 has not been  
prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with the relevant 
GRI-Criteria, 
or 
– the Non-financial Report contained within the Sustainable Value 
Report of the Company for the period from 1 January to  
31 December 2018 has not been prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with §§ 315b and 315c in conjunction with 289b to 289e HGB. 
In a limited assurance engagement the assurance procedures are less in 
extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement, and therefore a 
substantially lower level of assurance is obtained. The assurance proce -
dures selected depend on the practitioner’s judgment.
1  PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH has performed a limited assurance engagement on the German  
version of the “Sustainable Value Report” and issued an independent practitioner’s report in German 
language, which is authoritative. The following text is a translation of the independent practitioner’s 
report.123

Based on the assurance procedures performed and assurance evi -
dence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to 
believe that 
– the Sustainability Information in the Sustainable Value Report for 
the period from 1 January to 31 December 2018 has not been  
prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with the relevant GRI-Criteria,  
or 
– the Non-financial Report contained within the Sustainable Value 
Report of the Company for the period from 1 January to  
31 December 2018 has not been prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with §§ 315b and 315c in conjunction with 289b to 289e HGB.
Intended Use of the Assurance Report
We issue this report on the basis of the engagement agreed with the 
Company. The assurance engagement has been performed for pur-  
poses of the Company and the report is solely intended to inform the 
Company about the results of the limited assurance engagement.  
 The report is not intended for any third parties to base any (financial)

The data on fuel consumption, CO 2 emissions, power consumption and range are calculated according to the current versions of the prescribed measuring methods Regulation (EC) 2007/715 respectively. The data 
refers to a vehicle in its basic version in Germany, the ranges account for differences in the selected wheel and tyre size and optional extras and can change during configuration.  
As at: 31 December 2018.
The figures have already been calculated based on the new WLTP test cycle and reverse-calculated to make them comparable with the NEDC. Other values than those stated here may be applicable for these vehicles 
when calculating taxes and other vehicle-related charges that are (also) based on CO 2 emissions.
