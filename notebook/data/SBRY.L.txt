The past year has seen 
unprecedented change 
within the business and 
I’m proud of how we have 
adapted at pace in order 
to support our customers, 
colleagues and communities 
during the COVID-19 pandemic . 
Throughout the year 
we have had three 
key priorities: 
keeping 
our customers and colleagues safe, 
helping to feed the nation and 
supporting our communities 
and those most vulnerable in 
society . I am delighted that 
we raised £35 million for good 
causes this year, which includes 
donations made to our partners 
Comic Relief and FareShare to 
support those severely affected 
by the pandemic . We also 
created an additional £1 million 
local community fund for 
stores in January and created 
a digital version of our instore 
Food Donation Programme . 
Despite the level of change 
across the business this 
year, our sustainability 
commitments remain as 
important as ever  .  Last year we 
announced our commitment 
to invest £1 billion over 20 years 
to become Net Zero across our 
own operations by no later than 
2040  . In November we set out a 
plan to transform our business 
over the next three years, Net 
Zero by 2040 is a key priority 
for us and a central part of 
our plan to put food back at 
the heart of Sainsbury’s . We have also taken our Net 
Zero by 2040 plan further with 
the addition of an ambitious 
target across the value chain 
which requires the reduction 
of absolute greenhouse gas 
emissions by 30 per cent by 
2030  . Remuneration targets 
were also approved for the 
Board against priority pillars, 
further embedding our 
sustainability commitments 
into the business . 
As part of our Net Zero by 2040 
plan, we have set ourselves 
ambitious long-term goals 
that require fundamental 
change and we are making 
good early progress to reduce 
carbon emissions, food waste, 
plastic packaging and water 
usage and increase recycling, 
biodiversity and healthy and 
sustainable diets .  Positive 
examples include where we’ve 
decreased our food waste 
by 16 per cent and reduced 
our absolute greenhouse 
gas emissions within our 
operations by three per cent, a 
14 per cent reduction from our 
2018/19 baseline, keeping us on 
course for our headline target .  Committed to Net Zero by 2040
In his first year as Chief Executive Officer and a year on from launching our ambitious Net Zero by 
2040 commitment, Simon Roberts reflects on our progress and how we’re embedding sustainability 
across the business .

J Sainsbury plcSainsbury’s Sustainability Update 2020/2104
However in areas like plastic, 
increased volume as a result 
of the pandemic impacted the 
amount of plastic we put into 
the market, despite continuing 
to drive our plastic reduction 
initiatives .  From our varied 
results this year, we recognise 
the need to go further and 
faster working closely with our 
suppliers, but are confident that 
the activities and initiatives that 
have been implemented over 
the year across the business 
will support us in achieving our 
future goals . 
We continue to make progress 
on being a truly inclusive 
retailer where people love to 
work and shop . This year we 
set new corporate objectives 
for diverse representation in 
leadership positions for the top 
230 leaders and the next top 
1200 leaders (beneath the top 
230 leaders), with 2024 targets 
for female, ethnically diverse 
and Black representation . 
I’m pleased that 1,400 of 
our top leaders, including 
the Board, completed race 
fluency upskilling sessions 
this year, and we’ve continued 
to work on representation 
and transparency across the 
business, incorporating our 
ethnicity pay gap into our 
Gender Pay Report for the first 
time this year  . 
Our colleagues and customers 
care about wide-ranging, 
complex issues and we know 
that climate change is at 
the top of their minds . We 
recognise the enormity of the issue and know the solution is 
through collaboration, therefore 
as we look to the year ahead, 
I’m really pleased we were 
chosen to be a Principal Partner 
of the UN Climate Change 
Conference, COP26, taking 
place in Glasgow in November 
2021 . An exciting moment for 
the UK where world leaders, 
climate experts and businesses 
will convene to collaborate on 
the challenges ahead . We will 
also be hosting our inaugural 
Environmental, Social and 
Corporate Governance (ESG) 
day for investors in June . 
We have an exciting year 
ahead and we understand the 
scale of our business means 
we can make an important 
contribution to both society 
and the planet . We want to help 
everyone eat better and remain 
committed to accelerating 
progress across our ESG agenda 
so that we can drive lasting, 
positive change . 
Simon Roberts 
Chief Executive Officer

We have committed to investing £1 billion over twenty years towards 
becoming a Net Zero business across our own operations by 2040, 
aligned to the highest ambitions of the Paris Climate Change 
Agreement . We are implementing a programme of change, focusing 
on reducing carbon emissions, food waste, plastic packaging and 
water usage and increasing recycling, biodiversity and healthy and 
sustainable eating . 
To support our commitment and to drive long-lasting and meaningful change, we will be supporting the UN Climate 
Change Conference, COP26, as Principal Supermarket Sponsor in the upcoming year and signed up to the UN’s Race to 
Zero campaign, designed to accelerate the adoption of net zero targets ahead of COP26  . We have also set remuneration 
targets for the Board against our key Net Zero by 2040 pillars to help drive business performance . More information on 
remuneration targets can be found in our Annual Report and Financial Statements 2021 .Net Zero

Net Zero by 2040 
Last year we announced our 
commitment to invest £1 billion 
over 20 years to become Net 
Zero across our own operations 
by no later than 2040  . This 
target includes Scopes 1 and 
2, covering our direct and 
indirect emissions within our 
operations .  
Setting science 
based targets 
This year we have taken our 
ambitious Net Zero by 2040 
plan further with the addition 
of a Scope 3 target, which 
covers indirect emissions that occur throughout our value 
chain .  We want to reduce 
the environmental impact of 
our business and work with 
farmers, growers and suppliers 
throughout our supply chain to 
help them reduce theirs .  
The Science Based T argets 
initiative (SBTi) has approved 
our Science Based T argets for 
Scopes 1, 2 and 3  . For Scopes 
1 and 2, these include the 
reduction of greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions from 
Sainsbury’s own operations to 
Net Zero by 2040 in a bid to 
limit global warming to 1 . 5°C .  
We worked with the Carbon 
Trust to define an ambitious 
Scope 3 target which requires 
the reduction of absolute GHG 
emissions by 30 per cent by 
2030, to align to a well below 
2°C scenario . The baseline 
is 26,663,081 tC02e (2018/19) . 
The target includes reducing 
emissions from purchased 
goods, upstream transport 
and distribution, services 
sold and our customers’ use 
and consumption of the 
products we sell . We have also committed to working closely 
with our vast global supplier 
base to help them develop and 
then meet their own targets .   
“
“We congratulate 
Sainsbury’s for setting 
science-based targets 
consistent with limiting 
warming to 1 . 5°C, the 
most ambitious goal of 
the Paris Agreement . 
By aligning its goals 
with a 1 . 5°C future, and 
asking its partners to do 
the same, Sainsbury’s 
is ensuring it builds 
resilience firmly into its 
business model and will 
be positioned to thrive 
as the global economy 
transitions to a zero 
emissions future .”

Based T argets initiative 
partners) Carbon
Climate change and resource scarcity are complex, global challenges, which affect every part of our 
business . To grow our business sustainably, we are cutting carbon and maximising energy efficiency .

J Sainsbury plcSainsbury’s Sustainability Update 2020/2107
Cutting carbon 
emissions 
The impact of the pandemic 
on our emissions has been 
substantial . We have seen a 
reduction of energy usage due 
to the closure of certain areas 
of stores such as cafes and 
counters and all of our office 
space . We have seen more fuel 
usage due to the rise of online 
shopping and an increase in 
the number of products going 
through our supply chain . 
Overall, we have reduced our 
absolute GHG emissions within 
our operations to 818,161 tCO2e, 
a reduction of three per cent 
year-on-year and 14 per cent 
from our 2018/19 baseline, 
keeping us on course for our 
headline target . We continue 
to roll out our LED lighting 
programme, with 79 per cent 
of supermarkets already fully 
upgraded and we remain on 
track to install 100 per cent in 
our supermarkets by the end 
of 2021 .  
Following a successful trial, we 
are looking forward to rolling 
out five electric fridge trailers 
this year  . These are the first five to be used by in the UK 
and run on 100 per cent electric 
power, with battery charging at 
depot and an axle generating 
electricity to top up the battery 
when on the road .  
Disclosure and 
transparency 
We are proud to be recognised 
by CDP , an environmental 
impact disclosure system, 
for our environmental 
transparency . We were 
awarded an A rating for our 
climate change disclosure for 
the seventh consecutive year, 
the only UK retailer to have 
achieved this . We were also 
recognised by CDP as a 
Supplier Engagement 
Leader for our work 
engaging with our 
suppliers to tackle climate 
change .

Minimising water 
usage 
This year we have seen a 
reduction in water usage of 
eight per cent year-on-year, to 
2,776,288m³ . This equates to a 
14 per cent reduction from our 
2018/19 baseline, keeping us on 
track to meet our commitment 
to minimise water use as we 
aim for water neutrality by 
2040  .   Rainwater 
harvesting 
We continue to rollout rainwater 
harvesting systems across our 
estate in order to recycle water  . 
We currently have 120 rainwater 
harvesting (RWH) systems 
across our estate, and this year 
we installed our first micro 
RWH system in Balderton . 
Self-supply 
transition  
We are reviewing every aspect 
of water across the business, 
measuring and lowering 
the amount of water used 
across our estate by as much 
as possible . We made the 
decision to transition to self-supply so that we would have 
greater control over our water 
management, including meter 
readings, accuracy of data 
and future water reduction 
activities . Self-supply is where 
a customer buys water supply 
and wastewater services 
from the water company 
and provides their own retail 
services . In March 2021, we 
began the transition of our 
English estate to 100 per cent 
self supply .
Disclosure and 
transparency 
We are proud to be recognised 
by CDP , an environmental 
impact disclosure system, 
for our environmental 
transparency . We were 
awarded an A rating for our 
water disclosure for the second 
consecutive year  .  Water 
Water is the most precious natural resource on the planet . But, as populations increase, there’s 
less of it to go around . We’re doing our bit to tackle water scarcity by improving the efficiency of 
our water use across our operations, and are working with experts to implement water-saving 
initiatives . Through robust water stewardship, we are addressing and managing all areas of water 
vulnerability in our business as we aim for water neutrality by 2040  .

Reducing food 
waste 
We have committed to 
reducing food waste by 50 per 
cent across the whole value 
chain by 2030  . This year we 
reduced the food waste we 
send to anaerobic digestion 
in our own operations by over 
5,000 tonnes, a reduction of 16 
per cent year-on-year, which 
puts us ahead of our target 
trajectory . This has been driven 
by reductions in our overall 
operational waste figure, owing 
to propositional changes in our 
food service departments, as 
well as growth in the volume 
redistributed to humans 
and sent to animal feed as a 
result of the pandemic and 
process improvement . We are 
working on further process 
improvements to support us on 
delivering our commitment . 
Redistribution of 
surplus food 
The total amount of food waste 
generated this year was 36,338 tonnes, of which 27 per cent 
was surplus food redistributed 
for human consumption and 
for animal feed . We continue 
to divert surplus bread to 
animal feed, and this year we 
have built on this work and 
are trialling diverting unsold 
fruit, vegetables and salads to animal feed . We are also 
looking into initiatives to 
divert more surplus food for 
human consumption . For more 
information on our surplus food 
donations, see page 24 .  
Collaborating for 
greater impact 
We continue to support the 
delivery of Courtauld 2025/
Champions 12 . 3 and the 
UK Food Waste Reduction 
Roadmap . We wrote to our 
suppliers to encourage 
their participation in this 
initiative, and we are pleased 
to have seen an increase in 
participation this year  . We 
have also continued to work 
on our pilot whole-chain 
waste reduction projects in 
collaboration with WRAP 
and our suppliers . The first 
project reviewed the value 
chain of our own label frozen 
chips identifying key actions 
for improvement and waste 
reduction . We will finalise and 
implement findings from this 
project in the year ahead .  Food waste 
Around a third of all food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted, therefore we’re working 
to reduce or put as much of our waste as possible to good use . This includes working with farmers 
and growers to reduce food waste in our supply chain, sending surplus food from our stores to good 
use including to our charity food donation partners and recovering energy from our waste .

Reducing plastic 
packaging
COVID-19 has had a significant 
impact on our usage this year 
due to an increase in sales 
volume which has led to an 
increase in plastic packaging 
used overall . Therefore progress 
made in plastic weight 
reductions this year have been 
outweighed by the challenges 
of the pandemic . Year-on-year 
the tonnage has increased by 
3,496 tonnes to 117,959 tonnes, 
which puts us behind our target 
trajectory . Overall there has 
been a 1 . 7 per cent reduction in 
our food plastic packaging from 
our 2018 baseline . 
Although volume has increased 
this year, we continue to drive 
our plastic reduction initiatives 
which will support us with 
our longer term target . We 
recognise we have a lot more 
to do on plastic packaging 
reduction and along with 
new initiatives and a focus on 
collaboration, we look forward 
to making greater progress in 
the upcoming year  . Collaborating for 
success
We continue to collaborate 
on research to develop new 
packaging and recycling 
technologies . As members of 
WRAP’s UK Plastic Pact, we 
are collaborating to eliminate 
unnecessary single-use 
packaging by 2025 and working 
towards all plastic packaging 
being 100 per cent reusable, 
recyclable or compostable by 
2023, as well as containing 
at least 30 per cent recycled 
content by 2022 .
Our approach - 
remove, reduce, 
replace, recycle 
and reuse
Remove
Since pledging to halve our use 
of plastic packaging by 2025, 
we have removed thousands 
of tonnes of plastic across the 
business, including eliminating 
290 million loose produce 
plastic bags, rigid plastic trays 
from tomatoes, courgettes, 
kiwis & baby corn (216 tonnes), 
plastic overlids removed from 
cream pots (114 tonnes) and zip 
removal on frozen fruit bags 
(28 tonnes) . In the year ahead 
we will also be removing 18  .5 
million plastic straws from our 
own brand lunchbox carton 
range .Reduce
We continue to redesign and 
lightweight packaging where 
possible in order to reduce the 
volume of plastic used . This 
year we delivered an 86 per 
cent reduction in pancake mix 
packaging and 70 per cent 
reduction in steak packaging 
(in the So Organic and T aste the 
Difference ranges) .
We are working with Prevented 
Ocean Plastic to turn plastic 
collected from the coast into 
packaging for our strawberry and fresh fish range, removing 
297 tonnes of plastic from 
entering the ocean each year, 
and supporting customers to 
make more sustainable choices . 
In the upcoming year, 34 per 
cent of fresh fish and 80 per 
cent of strawberry punnets will 
be sold using packaging made 
from plastic recycled from 
coastal areas .
“
“I’d like to thank 
Sainsbury’s for identifying 
and embracing this real 
and positive action to 
reduce Ocean Plastic 
Pollution, support coastal 
collection communities 
and to help educate 
consumers that plastic 
is a valuable resource 
that can be recycled & 
not to be littered into 
environment .”
Patrick Gautier
UK Division Director for SharpakPlastics and recycling
Packaging helps us deliver fresh, undamaged produce, but we know that it can have a negative 
impact on our planet, therefore reducing plastic across all our stores and supply chain is one 
of our absolute priorities . This is why we were the UK’s first major retailer to make a significant 
commitment to reduce plastic, pledging to cut plastic packaging by 50 per cent by 2025  .

Replace
This year we trialled a new 
plant-based alternative for 
our own-brand teabags, using 
Polylactic acid (PLA) made 
from the sugars in cornstarch, 
cassava or sugar cane . This 
will be fully rolled out this 
year which will see 815 million 
individual teabags a year 
moved from using oil-based 
plastic to plant-based plastic . 
We will also be removing the 
outer plastic wrapping from 11 
products, which will result in 
a reduction of 16  .2 tonnes of 
plastic per year  .Recycle
Through our facilities we help 
our customers reduce their 
waste and put it to positive 
use, helping customers recycle 
unwanted clothing, metal cans, 
glass, plastic, paper and other 
materials at our managed 
recycling facilities in 273 
Sainsbury’s stores nationwide .
273
number of Sainsbury’s 
recycling sites This year we launched 
a 63-store trial for an in-
store recycling system 
for flexible plastics . The 
innovative recycling system 
allows customers to recycle 
Polypropylene (PP) film found 
in several household products, 
with further roll out taking 
place in the year ahead . We 
also provide front of store 
collection points for customers 
to bring back polyethylene 
(PE) film and carrier bags to 
supermarkets across the UK 
which are recycled back into 
carrier bags .100% of our hangers used 
for our Tu clothing are made 
from recycled materials . Last 
year we recycled eight million 
hangers, and in the year ahead 
we are looking at implementing 
processes to further increase 
the amount of hangers that we 
recycle . 
We are also continuing our 
work on piloting Deposit Return 
Schemes with our reverse 
vending machines . Customers 
can recycle plastic, metal cans 
and glass drink containers in 
exchange for a 5p per item 
coupon towards their shopping . 
We are working collaboratively 
with industry organisations 
and are a founding member 
of Circularity Scotland, the 
new not for profit ‘System 
Administrator’ of the Deposit 
Return Scheme in Scotland . 
Reuse and refill
We are providing more 
sustainable choices for 
customers, including the 
option to purchase a reusable 
drawstring bag when buying 
loose fruit and vegetables, 
each made from one recycled 
bottle . This follows us removing 
all plastic produce bags from 
our bakery and produce aisles 
in 2019, the first retailer to do 
so . We are also looking into 
refillable packaging options 
and in the past year we trialled 
an Ecover refill station, with 
dedicated refill points for dish 
washing and laundry detergent .

Increasing 
healthy sales
We know that food that is 
better for us is also better for 
the planet . This is why we have 
committed to develop and 
deliver healthy, sustainable 
diets for all . This year we 
announced a mass colleague 
and customer campaign, 
helping everyone eat better, to 
raise awareness and drive 
behaviour change . 
We want to help 
make healthy 
eating choices 
more affordable, 
easy and tasty, to 
support having a 
positive impact on 
the health of our 
customers and the 
health of the planet . In November 2020, we reported 
on the volume of ‘healthy’ 
sales relative to 
total sales . Moving 
forward, we believe 
reporting the 
tonnage of healthy 
and better for 
you sales relative 
to total sales is a 
more credible way 
to reflect the weight of plate from healthy 
choices, similar to the approach 
of the Eatwell Guide, and 
therefore this is how we will 
be defining a future target . 
Our current position is 55  .3 per 
cent healthy sales tonnage, 
remaining the same year-
on-year  .  We undertook an 
extensive piece of work to 
review the nutrition criteria 
used to define healthy and 
better for you sales . This 
approach will help us identify 
better choices within categories 
for both branded and own-label 
products, along a spectrum 
from less healthy to most 
healthy . 
Making everyday 
products 
healthier
We have an ongoing 
programme of reformulation, 
reducing sugar, salt and calories 
from our own brand products, 
in order to improve the nutrient 
profile of our products without 
compromising on quality or 
taste for our customers . We have been reducing sugar 
for a number of years and 
continue to make strong 
progress within key categories . 
We have achieved over a 20 per 
cent sugar tonnage reduction 
since 2015, from categories 
contributing most to children’s 
sugar intake . Whilst 93 per 
cent of our own brand products 
meet the Public Health England 
maximum calorie per portion 
target .  
We have a long history of 
providing clear nutritional 
information, and were the first 
UK supermarket to introduce 
front of pack traffic light 
labelling in 2005, going beyond 
government requirements . 
We ensure that our products 
are accurately and simply 
labelled, providing 
nutritional claims on 
our products to help 
customers understand 
the nutritional 
benefits of the 
product, including fibre and protein 
levels . We restrict nutrition 
and health claims on any 
own-brand product with a red 
traffic light label (except where 
naturally occurring), and we 
continue to reformulate to 
reduce the number of red traffic 
lights across our ranges .
Our prepared foods range 
has a wide choice of fruit and 
vegetable portions, helping 
our customers increase their 
consumption easily and in 
different ways . Our Love 
Your Veg range emphasises 
the benefits of increasing 
vegetables in our 
customers’ 
diets .Healthy sustainable diets
We are serious about our responsibility to help our customers eat healthily, whatever their budget .
As the UK’s second largest food retailer, we also know we have a role to play in helping to navigate 
customer choices and supplier behaviour towards more sustainable choices, helping to preserve 
our limited natural resources . A key priority for our business is to develop and deliver healthy and 
sustainable diets for all, therefore we aim to provide customers with the information, incentives and 
rewards to encourage healthier and more sustainable food choices .

Innovating for 
healthier choices
We continue to innovate in 
our product ranges to provide customers with new healthier choices
 .
 Our Plant Pioneers 
own-brand offer provides innovative and delicious options to customers following flexitarian or plant based diets
 .
 In September 2020, we 
increased our in store space allocated to fresh plant-based ranges by 40 per cent and continue to increase the availability of these products
 .
 
We also have products to help customers get enough of the key vitamins in their diet, including our Super Mushrooms fortified with B12 and Vitamin D and our Scottish salmon with additional Omega-3
 . The 
UK government advise two servings of fish a week, one of which should be oily
 .
 2020 
marks the twelth anniversary of the launch of our responsibly sourced Scottish farmed salmon reared exclusively on RSPCA Assured farms on the West Coast and Islands of Scotland
 .
 The salmon is fed a 
diet specifically formulated to ensure our fresh salmon is high in healthy long chain omega 3’s
 .
 For more on our approach to 
sustainable fish, see page 16  .W
e know it is particularly 
important that we do our bit to encourage our youngest customers on their journey to developing healthy eating habits
 .
 That is why we are 
particularly proud that our Little One’s range was awarded the 2020 Peas Please prize for Innovation in recognition of our vegetable first-taste products and for our Little One’s tray meals which contain at least two of your five a day
 .
Helping 
customers to make healthier choices
We understand many of our 
customers want to make healthier choices and we have been utilising ‘test and learns’ to help nudge customer behaviour by incentivising customers with value pricing or additional Nectar points
 .
 
In 2020 we launched the first ever Great Big Fruit & Veg Challenge to encourage and reward our customers for buying more fruit and vegetables, with over 450,000 customers signing up to take the challenge via the Nectar app
 .
 Analysis conducted with 
the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics suggested that Nectar card holders who took part in the challenge took home an extra 3
 .6 port
ions of 
fruit and vegetables per week during the challenge
 .
 We also 
ran initiatives such as our discounted 60 pence range where we aim to make fruit and vegetables more affordable and encourage customers to increase their intake
 .
  
Supporting 
healthy balanced diets during the pandemic 
During 2020, the importance of 
achieving a healthy balanced diet to avoid excess weight gain took centre stage, with Government announcing that those who are obese are significantly more likely to suffer worse outcomes of COVID-19 than those with a healthy body weight
 .
 
This year to support our customers and community in accessing vital food to support a healthy diet, we became a part of the Child Poverty T ask Force
 .
 In February we 
also topped up Healthy Start vouchers, provided by the Government to low-income pregnant women and families with children under the age of four
 .
 The vouchers consisted 
of a £2 fruit and vegetable coupon, more than any other retailer, to help families in need have access to nutritious produce through the half-term and summer holidays
 .
 
Collaborating for 
our customers
We are committed to 
promoting healthier lifestyles to our customers and continue to strive to ensure that all promotions, adverts, incentives and product placements, both in-store and online, are offered responsibly
 .
 
We also work with many research and campaigning organisations
 .
 Our partnership 
with Livestock Environment and People (LEAP) supports environmental research projects with the University of Oxford
 .
 
As part of one project, we were the first UK supermarket to trial selling meat-alternative products in meat aisles
 .
W
e continue to invest in 
research to make healthy and sustainable choices easier for customers and have partnered with the Institute of Grocery Distribution and Consumer Goods Forum on their Healthy and Sustainable Diets research projects
 .Disclosure and 
transparency
We are pleased to be the 
highest scoring retailer within the Access to Nutrition Initiative (ATNI), a review of the ten largest UK food retailers’ disclosures on nutrition, diets and health
 .
 We also report 
on the proportion of our total food sales that come from vegetables, which currently stands at 12 per cent, as part of our Peas Please Pledge

Protecting 
forests
With many of the world’s 
tropical forests at risk, we have 
a long history of collaborating 
with others to progress greater 
sustainable sourcing of palm 
oil, cocoa, soy and timber 
globally, and we are committed 
to sourcing 100% of our key 
materials to an independent 
sustainability standard . 
99.3% 
palm oil sourced 
to an independent 
sustainability standard 
We use palm oil in a variety of 
our own brand products and 
are proud that 99  .3 per cent 
of our palm oil is sustainably 
sourced to an independent 
standard, certified by the 
Roundtable on Sustainable 
Palm Oil (RSPO) . The RSPO 
sets the environmental and 
social standards for sourcing sustainable palm oil and 
includes palm oil producers, 
palm oil processors and traders, 
environmental NGO’s, consumer 
goods manufacturers, social 
NGO’s, banks and retailers .
We are continuing to seek 
new ways to ensure more 
of our palm oil is certified 
sustainable each year and are 
working with other retailers and 
manufacturers in order to send 
a clear market signal to bring 
sector-wide change . We are 
founding members of the Palm 
Oil Transparency Coalition and 
the Consumer Good’s Forum 
Forest Positive Coalition of 
Action . For more information 
on our approach to sourcing sustainable palm oil, please

Our longstanding partnership 
with The Woodland Trust 
enables us to continue to 
support the protection of 
woodland and biodiversity in 
the UK . This year we planted 
325,000 native trees . Since 
2004 we have planted over 4 . 2 
million native trees, which have 
the potential to mitigate over 
1 million tonnes CO2 . During 
this time we have raised £10  .8 
million for the trust and moving 
forward we aim to plant a 
further 1 . 5 million native trees 
by 2025  .  Biodiversity
We work closely with farmers, growers and suppliers – in the UK and internationally – so we 
can reassure customers about where and how our products are sourced . Sourcing our products 
sustainably helps us to improve people’s livelihoods, improve the quality of our products and 
contribute to tackling climate change .

Responsible 
fishing
We continue to lead the way 
in sourcing fish responsibly 
from both wild capture fisheries 
and farms and are committed 
to 100 per cent of our seafood 
sales being independently 
certificated as sustainable . 100 per cent of our farmed fish 
sources are independently 
certified to a recognised 
best aquaculture practice 
standard . We are currently in 
the process of transitioning to 
the Aquaculture Stewardship 
Council (ASC) standard for our 
farmed fish, the world’s leading 
labelling programme for 
responsible aquaculture .
76 per cent of our wild caught 
fish and seafood are certified to 
the Marine Stewardship Council 
(MSC) standard . Where fisheries 
are not yet certified, we are 
engaged with our suppliers in 
order to achieve certification in 
the shortest possible timescale 
through structured fishery 
improvement programmes .
We continue to support 
Project UK, which is working towards meeting the MSC 
standard for a number of 
species, including scallops, 
monkfish and langoustines, 
to deliver a sustainable future 
for these UK fisheries, as well 
as a number of international 
fisheries improvement 
projects . We also support 
a number of organisations 
driving responsible practice 
through pre-competitive 
collaboration and innovation 
such as the Global Dialogue on 
Seafood Traceability, Fisheries 
Innovation Scotland, Global 
Tuna Alliance and the Global 
Ghost Gear Initiative .
We’re proud to haves won MSC 
UK Supermarket of the Year 
in 2020, for the sixth time .  
The MSC UK annual awards 
celebrate the outstanding 
achievements in sustainable 
seafood across the entire UK 
seafood supply chain . With 
a consistently high range of sustainable seafood, and the 
largest number of MSC labelled 
fish and seafood products of 
any UK retailer, our sixth win 
in this category demonstrates 
our continued commitment to 
offering sustainable seafood to 
our customers, and at the same 
time protecting the oceans .
Sustainable 
general 
merchandise and 
clothing
As one of the largest general 
merchandise and clothing 
retailers in the UK, we can 
make a real difference . We 
have focused on driving 
transparency, including through 
updating our Tu website with 
key sustainability facts about 
our business and plans for the 
future .89% 
of our cotton is sourced 
more sustainably 
through the Better 
Cotton Initiative (up 
from 79% in 2019/20)
We also continue to increase 
our sourcing of sustainable 
cotton, and currently 89 
per cent of the cotton for 
our clothing and general 
merchandise is sourced more 
sustainably through the Better 
Cotton Initiative (BCI), up 
from 76 per cent in 2019/20  . 
Sourcing of Better Cotton has 
provided an estimated water 
saving of 6  .28 billion litres of 
water and an additional profit 
of an estimated €2 . 8 million 
benefitting BCI farmers in 2020  . Collaborating on 
global goals
With a growing population 
and our planet’s resources 
being pushed to their limits, 
we are focusing our efforts 
where we can make the 
greatest difference . We believe 
that industry collaboration 
is the only way to address 
domestic and global issues at 
the speed and scale required . 
We have a strong track record 
of partnering to help address 
global challenges and drive 
change in our value chains 
and are currently involved in 
many industry collaborations, 
including the Consumer Goods 
Forum, Better Cotton Initiative 
and the Roundtable on 
Responsible Soy Association .

Sustainable 
Sourcing
We source products from over 60 countries and have a vital role to 
play in supporting our farmers, growers and suppliers across the 
world .  We work collaboratively to tackle climate change, reduce 
our environmental impact and improve the livelihoods of farmers, 
growers and suppliers . Whether it’s our people, animals or the 
environment, we aim to have equivalent standards wherever we 
source from in the world .

Working closely 
with our farmers 
and growers
We’ve built strong relationships 
through our UK Farmer and 
Grower Development Groups 
and are working with these 
suppliers to develop a more 
resilient and sustainable 
British agricultural industry . 
We continue to work closely 
with our Dairy Development 
Group, paying our dairy 
farmers a fair price through 
our cost of production model . 
This provides a ringfenced 
supply which has continued 
to see benefits such as higher 
health and welfare outcomes, 
and improved efficiency and 
business sustainability . We 
have also been sourcing beef 
through the North Highland Initiative for over 15 years, 
supporting rural communities 
and over 100 beef producers in 
the far north of Scotland .
We have been working 
collaboratively with our 
growers through our Crop 
Action Groups (CAGs) since 
2006, sharing best practice 
and supporting Integrated 
Pest Management (IPM) . We’re 
proud to say that the number, 
size and reach of these groups 
has grown considerably over 
this time . We run CAGs over 
varied crop areas, covering the 
UK as well as other countries 
and regions, including Spain 
and South Africa .
Improving 
animal health 
and welfare
Protecting animal welfare is 
a top priority for both us and 
our customers and we also 
know that it increases farm 
productivity . We continue to 
be the largest retailer of RSPCA 
Assured products and this year 
won MSC Supermarket of the 
Year for the sixth time .
We have sold 100 per cent 
cage free eggs since 2009 and 
this year have moved to 100 
per cent free range eggs 
sourced from UK farms 
across our full range . 
Free range birds enjoy 
unlimited access to 
the outside during the 
daytime and are free 
to exhibit their natural behaviours . We also continue 
to provide our Egg Tracker on 
our corporate website, whereby 
customers can use the code 
printed on each eggshell to find 
out where the egg came from .
We remain committed to 
working with our Development 
Group farmers to share best 
practice on animal health 
and welfare across our supply 
chain . We have a data-led 
outcomes approach and 
work closely with our famers 
and suppliers to collect data 
across livestock areas . We 
utilise data dashboards to 
give us the best insights 
and engage our suppliers to 
drive improvements . We are 
confident in our approach of 
measuring and managing 
to continuously improve the 
health and welfare of our 
animals .

approach to animal health 
and welfare, see our Animal 
Health & Welfare Report and

Supporting 
British farming
As a UK retailer, we’re proud to 
support British producers . As 
well as boosting the national 
economy we’re reducing food 
transport miles . 
We continue to hold our annual 
Farming Conference as it 
provides a great moment to 
engage and converse with our suppliers on the year ahead . 
This year the conference was 
held virtually for the first time 
and attendees were given a 
business update from our CEO, 
Simon Roberts, as well updates 
on our Fresh Food strategy and 
our sustainability agenda .
We have a well established 
partnership with Linking 
Environment and Farming 
(LEAF), and this year we 
returned as a principal sponsor 
for their Open Farm Sunday 
event, for the fifth year  . Due to 
the pandemic the event was 
adapted this year to the first 
LEAF Online Farm Sunday, 
providing virtual farm tours .
We also continue to support 
LEAF’s Farmer Time initiative 
of which we are a founding 
supporter  . Farmer Time 
aims to inspire, engage and 
educate young people about 
the journey from farm to fork, 
alongside the everchanging 
diverse agricultural industry 
using the power of digital 
communication . To date, 
Farmer Time has paired 524 
schools with farms, which 
amounts to over 15,000 children 
chatting virtually to farmers 
from their classrooms .

Trading for a 
fairer future
We have a long history of 
supporting smallholder farmers 
and workers in our supply 
chain . In 2009 we began 
supporting the smallholder 
tea farmers of the Sukambizi 
Association Trust in Malawi 
through the development of a 
nursery growing heat resistant 
tea seedlings . In 2017 we 
launched the Sainsbury’s Fairly 
Traded Programme with the 
ambition to expand our support 
to all our East African tea 
supply chains . We’ve directly 
benefitted 26,900 people 
through the funding of projects 
supporting the environmental, 
social and economic resilience 
of farming communities across 
Malawi, Rwanda and Kenya . 
We will continue to evolve our 
approach as we work to address 
vulnerabilities in our supply 
chains . For more information 
see our Sainsbury’s Fairly 
Traded page at  www  .about .

Disclosure and 
transparency
Our customers care about 
where and how our products 
are sourced, therefore 
transparency within our 
supply chains is important . 
We’re pleased to have been 
ranked Tier 2 again this year 
in the Business Benchmark 
on Farm Animal Welfare 
(BBFAW), a global measure of company performance 
on farm animal welfare .  We 
also scored 47 per cent on the 
Fashion Transparency Index, a 
disclosure on policies, practices 
and supply chains . This was 
a huge jump from 28 per 
cent the previous year which 
demonstrates our investment 
to improve transparency of our 
policies and commitments .

are committed to being an inclusive employer where everybody is 
treated fairly and with respect, and where colleagues love to work 
and are encouraged to develop their skills and fulfil their potential .  
We continue to play an active role in our communities, and we have 
high ethical standards that we and our suppliers adhere to .

A place where 
colleagues love 
to work
Colleagues are at the heart of 
everything we do . We need 
them to understand our 
purpose and valued behaviours 
and we are working on a 
significant culture change 
project to achieve that . We 
want our colleagues to feel 
connected and engaged and 
we measure this through our 
annual colleague engagement 
survey . This year we increased 
our sustainable engagement 
score by six per cent to 81 
per cent, with 86 per cent of 
colleagues agreeing with the 
statement ‘I feel I am able to 
be myself at work’, up from 85 per cent last year  . We also 
introduced a check-in survey 
to ensure we’re engaging with 
colleagues regularly on how 
they’re feeling and get their 
input on business activities . 
Impact of 
COVID-19
COVID-19 has had a major 
impact on colleagues across the 
business both professionally 
and personally . Colleagues 
adapted positively and at pace 
to support our response to 
help feed the nation . We have 
listened and responded to our 
colleagues and customers 
throughout the pandemic and 
our colleagues have helped to 
inform many of the changes 
we have made throughout . 
We continue to invest in our 
colleagues, identifying and 
nurturing talent, providing 
training and development 
opportunities and ensuring 
they are rewarded fairly . 
More information on fair 
pay, including the thank-you 
payments made to recognise the hard work and commitment 
of our frontline colleagues 
during the pandemic, can be 
found in our Annual Report and 
Financial Statements 2021 .
Health and 
Safety
The health and safety of our 
colleagues and customers is 
a key part of our strategy . We 
have seen a long-term decline 
in both colleague and customer 
reportable injuries over the 
past five years; our colleague 
reportable injury rate has 
declined by over 25 per cent, 
whilst our customer reportable 
injury rate has declined by over 
20 per cent . An independent 
safety team supports our 
retail and logistics operations . 
They provide a combination 
of coaching, expertise and 
challenge to our line managers 
using our innovative risk 
mapping tool, utilising data 
from a wide range of sources 
to identify the key areas 
requiring support in any of 
our stores across the business . This helps us to ensure that 
we have the right level 
of compliance in place 
around key areas such as 
training, fire safety and 
adherence to procedures, 
as well as reviewing culture 
in individual stores through 
the lens of colleagues, regional 
management, and safety 
teams .
We have strong governance 
in place which ensures 
colleagues can feedback 
on issues, regular 
engagement with our 
unions and Board 
oversight . This 
includes our 
Great Place to 
Work groups, 
divisional level 
safety steering 
groups, our Group 
Safety Committee which 
reports into the Operating 
Board, as well as quarterly 
updates to the plc Board . 
We have strong and well-
established Primary Authority 
relationships in place that cover 
all our risk areas across health 
and safety, food safety, fire Our colleagues

• Our Women in Tech 
initiatives are designed to 
attract, develop and retain 
great female talent into 
technology roles
• We actively monitor 
and seek to improve 
the diversity of our

We continue to work 
on representation and 
transparency across the 
business and we incorporated 
our ethnicity pay gap into our 
Gender Pay Gap Report for the 
first time this year  . We have 
reduced our gender pay gap 
by 0  .8 per cent to 9  .7 per cent this year, while our median 
gender pay gap has increased 
slightly to 5  .0 per cent . Our 
mean ethnicity pay gap is 0  .4 
per cent . We set ourselves an 
aspirational target of reaching 
10 per cent ethnically diverse 
representation in senior 
positions (top 230 leaders) 
by the end of 2020/21; this 
currently stands at 8  .07 per 
cent, remaining the same 
year-on-year  . The proportion of 
women in senior management 
roles currently stands at 
37 .67 per cent, against our 
aspirational target of 40 per 
cent by 2020/21, an increase 
of 2 . 5 per cent year-on-year  . 
Across the entire business, 
female representation is 52 . 9 
per cent .  
To ensure sustained 
improvement, we continue 
to look at focused initiatives, 
culture and accountability 
through aspirational targets . We 
have set new, stretching targets 
to take us to 2024 which covers 
more of our talent pipeline and 
covers Black representation 
specifically (see table) . 
Importantly, these targets will 
form part of our long-term 
incentives for management .

Being an inclusive organisation 
with diverse representation 
at all levels of our business

a way to go, and we are 
committed to driving positive, sustainable change to improve 
the lived experience and 
opportunities for under-

colleagues or customers .
Recognising our 
great colleagues
We are also proud that some 
of our colleagues have been

Making a positive 
difference in our 
communities
We play an active role in the 
communities we serve and 
this year a key priority for 
us has been to support our 
communities and the most vulnerable in society during 
the pandemic . This year we 
raised a total of £35 million for 
good causes, which includes 
corporate donations, customer 
and colleague fundraising, 
merchandising and carrier 
bag profit . Alongside our 
community investment, we 
make positive economic contributions through our 
responsible approach to tax . We 
contributed £2 . 2 billion in taxes 
borne and collected this year, 
this includes the business rates 
relief Sainsbury’s chose to forgo .
Digitalising 
our approach to 
fundraising 
This year as volunteers were 
unable to fundraise in stores 
due to the impact of the 
pandemic, we adapted our 
campaigns and programmes to 
take a more digital approach to 
fundraising in order to protect 
the income of existing charity 
partners . We continue to support The 
Royal British Legion’s Poppy 
Appeal and have raised an 
estimated £40 million to date . 
This year customers were 
able to donate via a range 
of methods including the 
rounding up of bills on manned 
tills, fixed donations on self 
check-outs, donating points via 
Nectar and fixed donations via 
Groceries Online . Overall store 
donations were down year-
on-year but we saw a huge 
upsurge in online donations . 
We also introduced three 
new methods of donation; 
donation barcodes to be 
used with a SmartShop 
device, contactless 
donation points trialled 
in twelve stores and 
charity QR codes in store . 
Our Food 
Donation 
Programme
We have a long history of 
working with food banks 
and community donation 
schemes to support our Our communities
Sainsbury’s is a place-based business and our long-term business success relies on resilient, thriving 
communities .  We have presence in thousands of communities across the country through our 
supermarkets, convenience stores, store support centres and depots, as well as sourcing from over 
60 countries across the globe . Whether it’s the communities we serve or the communities we source 
from, we aim to have a positive impact on these communities, with the help of our partners and 
colleagues, in order to make a positive difference .
£35m 
raised for good causes 
this year
J Sainsbury plcSainsbury’s Sustainability Update 2020/2125
local communities . We are a 
founding member of FareShare 
which began in 1994 and 
continue to work with them to 
redistribute surplus food .
To support the huge amount of 
pressure on foodbanks, charities 
and community groups at 
the start of the pandemic, we 
made a £3 million commitment 
to FareShare . To ensure a 
coordinated approach, we 
worked as an industry through 
our partners, FareShare and 
the Institute of Grocery 
Distribution, to help charities 
and community groups access 
much needed food . The grant 
was used to support the 
end-to-end logistics, moving 
food donated from various 
organisations to frontline charities who have been 
supporting the most vulnerable 
during the pandemic . During 
this time, Sainsbury’s funded 
and supported distribution of 
over 24 million meals, via 3,945 
unique charities . 
We also trialled a digital Food 
Donation Programme this 
year, whereby customers were 
able to add a range of fixed amounts to their shops, with 
100 per cent of donations going 
to FareShare . The trial raised 
over £124,000 which resulted in 
the distribution of over 297,000 
meals . Due to it’s success, we 
have made this an ongoing 
feature on Groceries Online .
Help Brighten 
a Million 
Christmases 
This year for our Help 
Brighten a Million Christmases 
campaign, our focus was on 
food donations to support 
those most impacted by the 
pandemic . Stores worked 
with over 800 front of store 
Food Donation partners to 
redistribute food to foodbanks, 
charities and community 
groups . We also worked with 
FareShare and Comic Relief 
across some of our digital 
channels and in Argos . We 
offered digital fundraising 
channels in store for customers 
to donate products (digital 
donation was money only) or a 
financial contribution . 
We created a £5 million 
community pot where we 
matched every donation up to 
£4 million as well as a £1 million 
community fund for stores and 
support teams to contribute 
to local charities and good 
causes . In total the programme 
raised £5  .9 million, of which 
we donated £1 . 8 million to 
FareShare which supported the 
distribution of over 10 million meals to communities over 
Christmas .
Supporting our 
communities 
during the 
pandemic
Supporting foodbanks, 
charities and community 
groups was a key focus for us 
during the pandemic . We also 
supported Comic Relief and 
Children in Need by matching 
our customers’ donations £ 
for £ in the The Big Night In 
Appeal, with the total donation 
exceeding £4 million, split 
between the two charities, 
to support those severely 
affected by the pandemic . 
479,000 brand new items of 
Tu clothing were donated 
towards local communities and 
charities via Comic Relief and 
our existing charity network . 
We also supported Mail Force’s 
Computers for Kids campaign, 
by donating 2,000 laptops to 
help pupils during lockdown .
To support those shopping 
on behalf of others at the 
beginning of the pandemic, we 
provided Volunteer Shopping 
Cards in the form of e-gift cards 
to make it easier for customers 
to support those who were 
unable to shop for themselves . 
We also supported vendors 
who were unable to sell The 
Big Issue on the streets, the 
first time the magazine was 
available to buy in retail outlets, 
in order to maximise sales .

Championing 
human rights
We want to treat people fairly 
throughout our business and 
supply chains and we remain 
committed to respect human 
rights .  We identify vulnerable 
workers and do not tolerate any 
form of slavery or servitude in 
our own operations . 
We launched our Modern 
Slavery Risk Tool in 2017; this 
gives us unique insights 
into slavery risks across a 
complex global supply 
chain and we continue 
to embed the tool into the business by using its results 
for internal risk assessments . 
We provided training for 170 
suppliers this year on how 
to prevent modern slavery in 
our supply chains . We also 
supported the government’s 
response to the issues of forced 
labour in Xinjiang, China, 
by working collaboratively 
with the industry and our 
suppliers on policies, training 
and mappings risks . For more 
information on our 
Human Rights Policy 
and our Modern 
Slavery Statement,

suppliers
The pandemic provided a 
unprecedented challenge 
over the past year and a key 
priority for us was ensuring 
the safety of workers in our 
own operations and within 
our supply chains . We worked 
with other Food Network for 
Ethical Trade (FNET) members 
to sponsor the development of 
a series of webinars to support 
suppliers managing the impact 
of COVID-19 in the workplace . 
The supplier webinar series 
reached 3,993 participants in 55 
countries .

Collaborating for 
greater impact
We are active members of 
The Consumer Goods Forum 
(CGF) Sustainable Supply

global benchmarking initiative 
for third-party audit and 
certification programmes . We 
contribute to the Social and 
Management Criteria Technical 
Working Group and the 
Steering Committee . Through 
our policies and practices, we 
also support the CGF’s Human

Disclosure and 
transparency
We have taken part in the 
Workforce Disclosure Initiative 
(WDI) survey since its inception 
in 2017  . The WDI brings 
investors together to 
request comparable data 
from companies via an 
annual survey . The disclosure’s ultimate goal is 
to improve the quality of jobs 
in multinational companies’ 
operations and supply chains .  
This year we scored 89 per cent 
for our disclosure, an increase 
of over 30 per cent year on year, 
and well above the average of 
66 per cent for our sector and 
country . 
WDI also held the inaugural 
WDI awards this year where we 
gained a special mention for 
our COVID-19 response and won 
the award for our supply chain 
disclosure .
“
“We’re very happy to 
congratulate Sainsbury’s 
for being one of the 
three companies to win 
the Supply Chain Data 
Award in the 2020 WDI 
Workforce Transparency 
Awards . Supply chains 
are of course hugely 
complicated and 
changing all the time so 
qualifying for the Award 
by providing so much 
data in Sections 11-13 
of the WDI 2020 survey 
should be applauded 
and celebrated . We hope 
that more companies will 
follow Sainsbury’s lead in 
the future .”

Governance
J Sainsbury plcSainsbury’s Sustainability Update 2020/2129
Dear Shareholder, 
As a responsible retailer, 
we want to help everyone 
eat better, offering our 
products in a way 
that helps customers 
reduce their impact on 
the environment one 
plate at a time .  The Committee oversees 
the governance of being a 
sustainable business . The third 
year of my tenure as Chair of 
the Committee has seen some 
significant developments 
across the business, including 
the expansion of our Net Zero 
by 2040 plan to include Scope 
3, which we announced in 
February 2021 . The inclusion of 
the Net Zero by 2040 targets 
for senior management 
remuneration targets for 
2021/22 has been a step forward 
and I’m really pleased that 
the Net Zero by 2040 plan is 
a central part of our plan to 
put food back at the heart of 
Sainsbury’s . This past year has 
also been unprecedented in 
terms of the business change 
required to adapt to the impact 
of the pandemic, and I am 
proud of the pace at which 
we’ve adapted to best support 
our customers, colleagues, and 
the communities we serve .  
In January 2020 we announced 
our Net Zero by 2040 plan 
and committed to report on 
progress biannually, with 
our first results published in November 2020  . As the business 
adapted to feeding the nation, 
the impact of the pandemic 
played a considerable role in 
our progress this year  . We’ve 
seen changes in energy usage 
due to the closure of store 
operations and the increase 
of deliveries into homes and 
store, whilst changes in our 
food service provision and 
food surplus redistribution 
have impacted our food waste . 
Even in a year of great change, 
we continue to drive forward 
initiatives to reach our Net Zero 
by 2040 commitments . You can 
read more about how we have 
performed on page 34 . 
As well as our Net Zero by 
2040 target for Scope 1 and 
2 emissions, in line with the 
Paris Agreement to limit global 
warming to within 1 . 5°C, this 
year the Committee approved 
our Scope 3 target . The target 
is to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions (GHG) by 30 per cent 
by 2030, to align to a well below 
2°C scenario . We were pleased 
the Science Based T argets 
initiative (SBTi) approved our 
Science Based T argets for Corporate Responsibility and 
Sustainability Committee Report 

J Sainsbury plcSainsbury’s Sustainability Update 2020/2130
Scopes 1, 2 and 3  . This year the 
Committee worked with the 
Remuneration Committee to 
approve remuneration targets 
linked to plastic reduction and 
GHG emissions across Scopes 
1, 2 and 3, further embedding 
these objectives into the 
business .  
We became signatories of the 
T ask Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 
in January 2020, and this year 
we have taken this further 
by reporting our roadmap 
for TCFD disclosure  . We are 
also disclosing against the 
Sustainability Accounting 
Standards Board (SASB) 
framework for the first time this 
year  . For a summary of this, 
visit www  .about .sainsburys .
co .uk . 
COVID-19 has had a significant 
impact on the business over the 
past year, and the Committee 
has kept abreast of our key 
priorities to keep our customers 
and colleagues safe, help feed 
the nation and support our 
communities and the most 
vulnerable in society . The 
amount of change has been 
substantial for colleagues this 
year and therefore ongoing 
engagement and clear 
communication have been 
essential . We’re pleased that 
colleagues have remained 
engaged, with our colleague 
engagement score increasing 
by 6 per cent to 81 per cent . 
The Committee was also highly 
supportive of the initiatives put 
in place to reduce the pressure on foodbanks and help those in 
our communities most severely 
impacted by the pandemic . 
As a Committee, we continue 
to focus on stakeholder 
engagement including 
our customers, colleagues, 
suppliers, and the community, 
and have listened to and 
engaged with our stakeholders .  
There have been a number 
of changes to the Committee 
this year  .  Martin Scicluna 
and Simon Roberts joined the 
Committee on 1 June 2020  . We 
also welcomed Keith Weed 
to the Committee on 1 July 
2020 following Jean Tomlin’s 
departure .  Keith has significant 
sustainability experience 
having championed new ways 
of integrating sustainability 
into business and building 
brands with purpose in previous 
roles .  He has been a great 
addition to the Committee . 
I would like to thank all 
members for their contribution 
this year  .   
We are looking forward to 
holding an investor day 
in June 2021 focusing on 
Environmental, Social and 
Corporate Governance (ESG) 
where we intend to share 
what we’re doing to help the 
planet and society and ensure 
we have a sustainable future . 
The recordings from the day 
will be available online for all 
shareholders to view  . We are 
also really pleased we were 
chosen to be a Principal Partner 
of the UN Climate Change 
Conference, COP26, taking place in Glasgow in November 2021 . 
Climate change is a key global 
challenge which remains at the 
top of our agenda; we recognise 
the scale of the issue and 
know the solution is through 
collaboration .

 Principal 
activities in the 
year 
The Committee met three times 
during the year for scheduled 
meetings and one additional 
meeting was arranged to 
discuss remuneration targets . 
The meetings focused on our 
Net Zero by 2040 plan and 
stakeholder engagement – 
customers, colleagues, the 
community, suppliers and 
shareholders . Updates and 
progress against our Net Zero 
by 2040 plan was a key focus 
of the Committee this year 
and the Committee played a 
fundamental role in approving 
the Scope 3 GHG emissions 
targets .  
The Committee was updated on 
our customer and community 
response to the pandemic . 
This included our evolved 
fundraising approach with 
the development of new 
digital fundraising channels 
and initiatives to support the 
income of existing partners .  
Culture and colleague 
engagement were an important 
part of the Committee’s 
agenda . The Committee was 
updated throughout the year 
on the impact of the pandemic 
on colleagues and the ongoing 
steps being taken to keep our 
colleagues and customers safe . 
Members were provided with 
the results of the colleague 
engagement surveys and 
discussed the initiatives put 
in place to address colleague feedback .  
The Committee was pleased 
with the progress made on 
supplier engagement and the 
steps taken during the year 
that led to an increase in our 
benchmark position in both the 
Advantage Suppliers Survey 
and Groceries Code Adjudicator 
report . The Committee also 
received feedback from the 
Chair of the Sainsbury’s 
Foundation Advisory Board 
on the Sainsbury’s Fairly 
Traded Programme, how the 
Foundation has functioned and 
opportunities for the future .  
Committee members were also 
keen to understand the actions 
being taken to respond to 
regulatory developments such 
as supply chain legislation, 
including a Defra consultation 
on deforestation and on EU 
Human Rights Due Diligence, 
and the cost and impact of 
these on the business . The 
Committee was also updated 
on the impact of extended 
producer responsibility, and 
increased campaigner action 
and public awareness of 
illegality in supply chains . 
Modern slavery and human 
trafficking are abhorrent 
practices that still exist in many 
parts of the world, including 
the UK . The Committee 
reviewed the steps being taken 
to prevent modern slavery 
and human trafficking in our 
business operations and supply 
chain and recommended that 
the Board approve our Modern 
Slavery Statement .  Engaging with shareholders 
on ESG matters is becoming 
increasingly important . The 
Committee discussed our 
approach and developments 
in this area and the hosting 
of an ESG focused event 
with investors was approved 
for the upcoming year  . The 
Committee also worked with 
the Remuneration Committee 
to review and approve the 
remuneration targets for senior 
management against key areas 
of our Net Zero by 2040 pillars .

We started the 2020/21 financial year ahead of our target trajectory which supported us to achieve our target  . Store closures as a result of COVID-19 also contributed to the carbon savings 
across the year as did our continued focus on LED light installation, with a total of 472 supermarkets with LED lights installed by the end of the 2020/21 financial year  .
The future programme continues to be well planned and focuses on efficiency improvements  . The 2021/22 financial year will see the LED programme completed across the estate .

Flat year-on-year with no significant movement within a category  . Improvement in future years will be driven by a new target and category level plans  .

Commentary
This year we reduced the food waste we send to anaerobic digestion in our own operations by over 5,000 tonnes, a reduction of 16 per cent year-on year, which puts us ahead of our 
target trajectory  . This has been driven by reductions in our overall operational waste figure, owing to propositional changes in our food service departments, as well as growth in the 
volume redistributed to both humans and animals as a result of impacts from the pandemic and process improvement  . See page 10 for breakdown of redistribution to humans and 
animals  .
Our ability to meet our target is dependent upon increasing the amount we redistribute for human consumption and we are looking into third party tech solutions to enable this  .

Commentary
In 2020, our efforts to reduce packaging were hampered by COVID-19 due to increased sales volumes and having to use plastic for some high volume lines, e . g . for eggs, as pulp packaging 
supply ran out across the industry  . However if we strip out the impact of COVID-19 we are still behind our trajectory so significant progress is required in order for us to meet our long term 
target  .

Commentary
% timber sourced to an independent sustainability standard
Last year we reported on Sainsbury’s only  . This is the first year that we have reported on Argos and Habitat which will be a focus going forward  .
% palm sourced to an independent sustainability standard
Our sustainable sourcing performance on palm oil remains strong and we continue to strive towards our 100 per cent target  .
% soy sourced to an independent sustainability standard
This year saw a significant improvement in the share of soy feed sourced sustainably in our supply chains as we continue engaging with our suppliers  .
% cotton sourced to an independent sustainability standard
Improvements this year are attributed to a greater sourcing of sustainable cotton within General Merchandise and Clothing  .
% wild caught seafood sales which is independently certified as sustainable
The fall this year can be attributed to mackerel loosing its Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certification which creates challenges for meeting our long term target  .
% farmed seafood sales which is independently certified as sustainable
Our farmed seafood remains 100 per cent sustainably certified and we expect to be the first retailer to transition to Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) in the UK  . 
Number of Woodland Trust trees planted
Last year we focused on planting trees in strategic areas (schools and communities) as oppose to chasing the highest number  .Biodiversity
