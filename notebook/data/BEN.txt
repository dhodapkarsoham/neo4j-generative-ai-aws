change creates an opportunity to 
better meet client needs.
Being a good corporate citizen is 
essential to our role in building a 
better world. It’s also good business. 
Each step we take on our CSR 
journey helps us better serve our 
stakeholders and furthers our 
commitment to sustainability.
In fiscal year 2021, we achieved our 
full set of CSR goals outlined in last 
year’s report and executed on key 
priorities, including the following:
Stewardship and Sustainable 
Investing
To further connect sustainability 
leaders from our specialist 
investment managers (SIMs) and 
guide the evolution of our sustainable 
investing practices and infrastructure, 
we formed our Stewardship and 
Sustainability Council in March 2021. 
In July 2021, Franklin Templeton’s A Message from 
CEO Jenny Johnson
As we celebrate Franklin Templeton’s 
75th anniversary, I am proud to 
present our FY2021 Corporate 
Social Responsibility (CSR) 
Report —  part of our ongoing 
commitment to progress. We live 
in a time of rapid change, with 
innovation transforming entire 
industries. At the same time, we 
face great challenges, including 
the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, 
the tragic war in Ukraine, the 
accelerating effects of climate 
change, and uncertain economic 
conditions. Now, more than ever, 
we are steadfast in our commitment 
to CSR for our clients, our global 
employees, and the communities 
and world around us.
This report details Franklin 
Templeton’s approach to our six 
dimensions of CSR, highlights our 
achievements in the last year, and 
demonstrates our belief that every investment groups, along with 
ClearBridge Investments, Brandywine 
Global and Martin Currie, joined 
the industry-leading Net Zero Asset 
Managers initiative (NZAMI) to 
support its goal of net-zero emissions. 
In February 2022, we appointed 
Anne Simpson as Global Head of 
Sustainability, a newly created role 
as one of my direct reports and 
working in close partnership with 
Dr. Ben Meng, Franklin Templeton’s 
executive sponsor of sustainability. 
Anne brings 35 years of global 
sustainable investment and 
academic experience. This hire is 
a testament to our commitment to 
upholding environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) principles and 
acknowledges that our investment 
decisions have a profound effect 
on the world and its future. 
Building on our existing presence 
in this area, Anne will advance our 
sustainable investment strategy

and global engagement with 
corporations on material sustainable 
investment issues.
Diversity and Inclusion (D&I)
A strong focus on D&I is fundamental 
to navigating the dynamic 
landscape in our industry. Clients 
are increasingly taking stands on 
D&I and social issues and seeking 
partners and investment vehicles 
with the same values. In fiscal year 
2021, we developed a holistic D&I 
strategic framework that focuses 
on our People, Practices and Public 
Commitment. Over the past year, we 
prioritized inclusive leadership and 
required every employee to set a 
diversity goal. We invested in female 
and Black entrepreneurs, and we 
have expanded recruitment and 
development of underrepresented 
employees in partnerships with 
the Financial Alliance for Racial 
Equity (FARE) and the Equity 
Collective. We were recognized 
by Fund Intelligence for “Best DEI Initiative” for our sponsorship of 
Nex Cubed’s Historically Black 
Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) 
Founder’s Program.
Environment/Climate
Over the past year, we further 
strengthened our efforts to address 
climate-related issues. We continued 
to reduce our emissions and expand 
our Scope 3 reporting. We set an 
emissions target aligned with the 
science of climate change and 
established a firm-level Environmental 
Committee to help advance our 
global strategy and initiatives. 
Franklin Templeton has completed 
more than a decade of reporting to 
CDP, the industry leader for climate 
disclosure. We maintained a B score 
in 2021, which placed us above 
average for companies reporting 
both in North America and globally. 1
For the year ahead, we have 
established important goals and 
commitments, including commencing Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 
reporting; advancing progress 
within our Net Zero Asset Managers 
initiative (NZAMI) commitments; 
completing third-party verification 
of our corporate-level greenhouse 
gas emissions; and implementing 
initiatives to provide access and 
opportunities to underserved 
entrepreneurs, businesses and 
suppliers. A full list of fiscal year 
2022 goals and commitments can 
be found later in the  report .
Taking Action for the Future
Our commitment to CSR is a journey. 
We build on our achievements 
and make progress every day. 
It’s essential that our clients, 
shareholders, employees and other 
stakeholders have confidence in our 
integrity as a responsible corporate 
citizen. We will continue to employ 
the highest standards in the way we 
operate and invest on behalf of our 
clients. This commitment is reflected in the way we treat our employees 
and serve our communities, and 
in our efforts toward inclusivity 
and limiting our impact on the 
environment. We are always focused 
on ways we can do even better.
I invite you to read our report 
including highlights and commitments 
across our CSR dimensions. We 
have also included data related to 
Sustainability Accounting Standards 
Board (SASB) standards and the newly 
added Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
index for increased transparency and 
disclosure. As always, we welcome 
your feedback to globalcitizenship@
franklintempleton.com .
Sincerely,
 
Jenny Johnson 
President and Chief Executive Officer

Our six  
dimensions  
of CSR Stakeholder Engagement and Materiality
As a global investment management organization, we manage and address 
a broad range of environmental, social and governance issues. In 2019, 
we conducted a robust process to gather inputs from a variety of internal 
and external stakeholders to determine the topics that were most important 
to them as well as to our business. We validated these topics through 
additional stakeholder engagement, industry benchmarking and review of 
primary international reporting frameworks. We narrowed down these issues 
to Franklin Templeton’s six dimensions of CSR, which are outlined below. 
Going forward, we plan to continue stakeholder engagement to be responsive 
to stakeholder needs and prepare for future opportunities and risks.Our Six Dimensions of CSR
CSR is embedded in our corporate values: put clients first, build relationships, 
achieve quality results and work with integrity. This is an important aspect 
of how we work to deliver better outcomes. Elements of each dimension are 
inextricably intertwined and support each other.

We recognize an organization of our breadth and scale can have a more 
powerful influence on issues in this area by coordinating our efforts within a 
global strategic framework. Our goal is to be a global leader in stewardship 
and sustainable investing, and to extend that leadership through collaborative 
participation in key industry initiatives and partnerships.
In 2021, we published our first stewardship report, aligning our firm with 
the 12 principles of the UK Stewardship Code and putting data behind our 
commitment to excellence and transparency in the responsible allocation, 
management and oversight of capital on behalf of our clients. We plan to 
release our next report in April 2022.
At the board level, according to its charter , the Corporate Governance 
Committee is formally designated to assist our board of directors in 
overseeing Franklin Templeton’s corporate responsibility and sustainability 
programs related to ESG matters.
Global Head of Sustainability
Building upon our decades of focus on sustainability, in February 
2022, Anne Simpson became Franklin Templeton’s first Global Head of 
Sustainability, a newly created role that reports directly to the CEO. Anne 
works in close partnership with Dr. Ben Meng, Franklin Templeton’s executive 
sponsor of sustainability. Bringing a deep and wide-ranging international 
expertise in sustainable investing to the role, Anne will drive the firm’s overall 
strategic direction on stewardship and sustainable investment strategy.Stewardship and Sustainability Council
To fully leverage the wealth of expertise across our autonomous investment 
teams, in March 2021 we established a firm-wide Stewardship and 
Sustainability Council comprising key investment leaders from each of our 
specialist investment managers (SIMs).
The council represents the diversity and depth of investment approaches 
across our SIMs and is responsible for developing the overall philosophy 
guiding how we work together on common sustainability challenges 
and priorities.
In addition to the dedicated experts within our SIMs, our Global 
Sustainability Strategy Team (GSST) plays an integral role on the council. 
This centralized team of sustainability specialists provides independent 
analysis, insights, training and education, and acts as internal consultants on 
material sustainable investment issues, themes and industry best practices.
GSST specialists have extensive experience across the sustainable 
investment policy and regulation landscape and in areas such as 
sustainability data science and net-zero portfolio target setting. They 
engage with our investment teams and risk management professionals to 
help them recognize and understand the impact and scope of material 
ESG issues. And they consult on sustainable investment topics in their 
analysis and use research and tools to ensure that ESG issues are addressed 
throughout our investment processes.

Active Ownership and Engagement
As responsible stewards of our clients’ capital, we have a duty to protect 
and enhance the economic interest of their assets. To be most effective, 
stewardship must include engagement with the companies and other issuers 
of the securities we invest in and the responsible exercise of our fiduciary 
duties and voting rights as investors. As part of this commitment, we continue 
to engage directly with hundreds of investee and issuer companies and vote 
on tens of thousands of resolutions annually.
Industry Partnerships
As advocates for our clients, we work with a wide range of organizations 
that are establishing and promoting best practices for incorporating 
sustainability into investment processes. We are signatories to the Principles 
for Responsible Investment (PRI), the leading global investor network 
that champions responsible investing. As part of this commitment, we are 
represented on the Select Advisory Committee to the Assessing Sovereign 
Climate-related Opportunities and Risk (ASCOR) Initiative.
We are a member of the Ceres Investor Network on Climate Risk and 
Sustainability, which includes more than 200 institutional investors managing 
more than $47 trillion (all figures U.S.) in assets. We are a proud signatory 
to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and an 
investor signatory to CDP, a well-known global, environmental disclosure 
organization formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project.

1. Revised the scope 1 base year figure in 2020 to include mobile emissions associated with two facilities inadvertently excluded in the past as all 
emissions for these two facilities were previously estimated. Revised the scope 2 base year figure in 2020 to include natural gas, refrigerant and 
electricity emission estimates for leased facilities less than 10,000 square feet, as well as natural gas and refrigerant emission estimates for other 
leased facilities for which we were unable to obtain actual data.
2. As defined by the GHG Protocol. Scope 1: Direct GHG emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the company. Scope 2: Electricity 
indirect GHG emissions from purchased electricity consumed by the company. Scope 3: Indirect GHG emissions that occur in the value chain.
3. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) is Franklin Templeton’s consultant for this work.In 2021 we established an enterprise-level Environmental Committee to 
help advance our global strategy and drive innovation for our green initiatives. 
The committee has executive sponsorship and includes colleagues from 
across the organization.
Our Environmental Policy Statement  outlines our core goal of continually 
improving our environmental impact. Energy reduction initiatives at company-
owned facilities, plus remote work policies during the pandemic, have led 
to total emissions reductions of approximately 57% since 2007, our baseline 
year, despite the significant expansion of our business due to organic growth 
and acquisitions. 1
In 2020, scope 1 and scope 2 location-based emissions totaled 6,729 and 
23,063 tCO 2e (metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent), respectively. 2
In 2021, in addition to reporting on scope 1 and 2 categories, we expanded 
our reporting of scope 3 categories in the firm’s annual CDP response. We 
initiated third-party emissions verification 3 to further transparency of our 
reporting, and we established a science-aligned emissions target. Franklin 
Templeton commits to reducing our scope 1 and 2 emissions 50% by 2030 
from a 2019 baseline. This emissions reduction goal is aligned with the 
science of climate change, and designed to limit global warming to 1.5°C. 
We plan to achieve our target through a variety of approaches, including 
expanded energy reduction programs, office consolidations and renewable 
energy initiatives.57%

We have implemented environmentally conscious business practices and 
building features across our global footprint. In addition to minimizing the 
impact of our business functions, we are striving to continually reduce the 
environmental footprint of our facilities.
For example, we recycle or reuse natural resources and encourage employees 
to extend these environmental practices to offices, cafeterias and community 
activities, and we continually look for new ways to reduce the use of 
consumable materials in our daily operations.
In two data centers in California, we used a new, more energy-efficient 
approach to design and invested in building improvements to increase 
energy efficiency. The buildings, in Rancho Cordova and Stockton, California, 
feature cool roof technology to reflect warming sunlight and hot and cold air 
management, which reduces the need for energy-intensive cooling.
Our real estate development projects have a goal of minimizing energy 
consumption. We monitor the air quality and energy usage in our offices, use 
environmental management systems where feasible and carefully monitor 
environmental regulations to ensure we meet or exceed all requirements.Our recently constructed office building in Poznan, Poland, was designed 
to LEED Standard (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) and 
certified as LEED Platinum, the highest rating available. The building where we 
lease office space in Baltimore is certified as LEED Silver and our office within 
the building is certified as LEED Gold. Newly constructed buildings in San 
Mateo, California (headquarters) utilize solar panels.
On a broader scale, we seek to minimize energy consumption in our real 
estate development and renovation projects. As part of our practices, we:
• Employ environmental management systems to monitor air quality and 
energy use.
• Use sustainable materials and supplies.
• Maximize recycling programs in our facilities.
• Continually look for new ways to reduce the use of water in our 
daily operations.

Digital Earth Day and Week 2021
For the 51st annual Earth Day, Franklin Templeton employees used a virtual 
approach to taking positive action for our environment. Throughout the 
month, the Franklin Templeton Global Green Team provided employees with 
daily ideas for everyday green actions, and during Earth Week, virtual events 
included an environmental quiz, carbon footprint calculator and a kid-friendly 
Earth Day art project. Employees could set personal challenges to use as little 
energy as possible for a day or weekend or to conserve water.
Franklin Templeton participated in community cleanup events around the  
globe. Florida employees participated in a local beach cleanup, while 
Connecticut volunteers joined a coastal cleanup. In Poland, employees and 
families staged a “clean walk” around their neighborhoods to pick up trash. 
“It is incredible how kids learn by example. During our clean walk we collected 
three bags of bottles. It was still not enough for the kids, and they wanted to 
go again. This might become our weekly habit,” said the volunteer project 
leader from our Poznan, Poland, office.

We encourage initiatives from employees who are passionate about 
environmental responsibility. Our Global Green Team encourages all 
employees to conserve resources throughout the year to further awareness 
and progress. Some examples of employees’ green initiatives include:
• Our long-running oyster gardening initiative, which helps to filter 
the Chesapeake Bay. See: Baltimore Employees Preserve Local 
Oyster  Population .
• Earth Hour in March, which invited employees to switch off lights at 
home, on the same day that Franklin Templeton facility managers were 
encouraged to turn off office signs and lights for one hour.
• The Plastic-Free July awareness campaign, which encourages employees 
to commit to ways to reduce single-use plastic waste.
In the past year, Franklin Templeton has partnered with environment-focused 
charitable organizations, including SoundWaters in Stamford, Connecticut, 
which advances environmental justice and equity by creating access to Long 
Island Sound for education and stewardship; the Lower East Side Ecology 
Center, which provides e-waste and composting services, environmental 
stewardship opportunities and educational programming to New Yorkers; and 
the Waterfront Partnership of Baltimore Inc., which aims to create a clean, 
green, safe, sustainable and thriving urban waterfront.Clarion Partners Brings Solar Energy to Flagship Bronx Property
In August 2021, our specialist investment manager Clarion Partners 
installed 917 solar panels at their flagship Quality Communities property 
in Eastchester Heights, a 1,416-unit residential apartment complex 
spanning five city blocks and 114 individual buildings. Built in 1935 and 
situated on 14.84 acres, it is among the largest residential communities 
in the Bronx and greater New York City. The installation will produce 
over 1.1 million kilowatt hours of clean electricity, equivalent to removing 
165 cars from the road for a year or the carbon sequestered by over 
12,800 tree seedlings grown over 10 years. The solar panels will decrease 
emissions in an area that has the highest asthma rates in the country, 
and help New York make progress toward its goal of 100% carbon-free 
electricity by 2040.

Animated Series on Environmental Literacy with Razer
To help educate an audience of all ages about environmental issues and what 
they can do to live more sustainably, Franklin Templeton partnered with Razer, 
the leading global lifestyle brand for gamers, to release a new animated series 
starring Razer’s fan-favorite sustainability mascot, Sneki Snek.
Franklin Templeton is sponsoring the first season of the show, which consists 
of six episodes and tackles issues such as deforestation, over-fishing, air 
pollution, upcycling, slash-and-burn farming and climate change.
With Franklin Templeton’s commitment to saving 50,000 trees through this 
campaign, the Sneki Snek goal to save one million trees together with the 
community is drawing even closer.

listening strategy includes regular employee sentiment surveys, and we strive

Experience, Exposure and Education
Continuous learning is critical to each person’s success, and our approach to 
development focuses on three avenues: experience, exposure and education. 
Our employees gain experience through everyday activities according to their 
role. Exposure means providing opportunities to network, acquire or develop 
mentoring relationships and gain valuable feedback from others. Education 
includes structured learning solutions for core and specialized competency 
development through web-based or instructor-led programs.
Through our Learning at FT portal, we offer a wide range of internal and 
external development options for employees that are relevant to their scope 
of work, development goals and professional objectives. Additionally, the New 
Employee Learning Series provides new employees a curated collection of 
learning resources about our company, culture and industry as they onboard

rewards designed to recognize their time, talents and results. These benefits 
and offerings include:
• Flexible work environment and inclusive culture.
• Fair, equitable and competitive compensation that rewards employees 
at all levels of the organization for performance and contributions to the 
company’s success.
• Health, wellness and risk benefits to protect and restore health and wellness 
for employees and their families.

Involved  global volunteer program and the volunteer paid time off benefit.
• Business resource groups  that promote inclusion, foster networking and 
collaboration and support new employees.
• Support for pursuing certifications, external education and a tuition 
assistance program available to full-time employees.
We acknowledge the value of well-being and the need to invest in ourselves. 
At Franklin Templeton, well-being is not just about being healthy. It’s seen 
as the blending of many aspects —  a combination of physical, emotional, 
financial, purpose and social well-being. It’s all interrelated.

We continue to prioritize health and wellness for all employees. At the 
height of the pandemic, over 97% of our employees worked from home. In 
addition to providing online tools for collaboration and enabling a flexible 
work environment, we focused on the importance of self-care, mental health 
awareness and wellness. In 2022 we are offering additional wellness support 
that focuses on helping employees with mindfulness, meditation, managing 
stress and anxiety, parenting and building emotional intelligence.
We bolstered our existing support programs with new resources to address 
five specific wellness pillars (physical, emotional, financial, social and purpose), 
additional Employee Assistance Program (EAP) counseling coverage, a new 
wellness program (via Virgin Pulse), virtual fitness classes and a new paid 
global parental and family caregiver leave program.
Other enhancements include:
• Self-care and life stages support —  menopause education, body image, 
heart health, stress relief.
• Expansion of virtual health care/telehealth options.
• Enhancement of mental/emotional health support through mindfulness 
tools, leader and employee education and activity challenges.

the number of women in portfolio management and executive 
leadership in the asset management industry. When Jenny won the 
competition among a distinguished pool of 52 CEOs and business 
leaders, Girls Who Invest received $260,000 and joined a virtual 
celebration that offered scholars an opportunity to connect with 
Jenny and other colleagues from our firm. Franklin Templeton hosts

Risk Management
Risk management is an essential part of our daily activities as responsible 
stewards of our clients’ assets. Our clients trust us to maintain appropriate 
protective measures globally. All the company’s enterprise risk management 
functions report to our Chief Risk and Transformation Officer.
Investment risk is a fundamental aspect of our business, and we have 
developed a large and highly experienced investment risk management 
team, with over 100 professionals in 19 locations around the world. Our local 
risk managers work alongside the chief investment officers and portfolio 
managers to ensure effective portfolio oversight. Our central investment risk 
team manages our firm-wide governance structure, supports a consistent risk 
framework and standards, challenges and reviews our local teams and gathers 
risk intelligence across the organization. Collectively, both the local and 
central teams are responsible for the ongoing development of our investment 
risk program.
The enterprise risk management function is responsible for identifying risks 
at the enterprise level, administering monitoring programs and assessing 
industry trends. Our Chief Risk and Transformation Officer meets, at a 
minimum, four times annually with the Audit Committee or Board of Directors, 
providing consistent and transparent communication and ongoing reporting 
on enterprise risk management processes, findings and trends.Global Compliance
Our Global Compliance team has grown over time, mirroring the company’s 
growth in countries around the world to ensure we meet the varying local 
regulatory requirements in countries where we operate. In some still-evolving 
markets our team has had the opportunity to work with local regulators and 
share global best practices in the development of effective regulation.
Accountability starts with our executive leadership and extends throughout 
our organization to all employees. Our Board of Directors affirms governance 
practices and policies that cultivate an environment of compliance. With 
support from senior management, our Head of Global Regulatory Compliance 
provides oversight of compliance policies and programs, and our Regulatory 
Compliance Group ensures that we have appropriate processes and 
procedures in place to comply with evolving rules and requirements globally. 
We also conduct regular internal audits and reviews.
Our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct  is the foundation of our culture 
of trust and respect. Our employees align with these values and comply with 
applicable laws in their work, and our Regulatory Compliance Monitoring team 
reviews related polices and controls on a scheduled basis.
We provide regular training to ensure that our employees are aware of and 
in compliance with up-to-date local laws and regulations. Our Compliance 
Education team is a cross-functional group of experts who ensure that 
employees meet all annual educational requirements.

We provide a corporate ombudsman and a confidential Compliance and 
Ethics Hotline, which is operated by a third party to ensure confidentiality, 
for employees to report potential legal or ethical violations or communicate 
concerns. The firm has a policy in place to protect those who report any 
misconduct, commonly known as “whistleblower protection.”
In 2021 we created a centralized Financial Crime Compliance team within 
Global Compliance to meet the increased global regulatory focus on financial 
crime. The 15-member team has overall responsibility for financial controls 
such as anti-money laundering (AML), anticorruption, antiterrorism financing 
and sanctions.
We support international AML and antiterrorist financing laws, rules and 
standards in the jurisdictions in which we do business. Our AML statement 
can be found here , and our sanctions program statement can be found here . 
The AML program’s policies and procedures were established to prevent and 
detect money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities. The five 
pillars of the program include: establishing and implementing policies and 
procedures; independent testing; designation of an AML Compliance Officer; 
ongoing training; and understanding the nature and purpose of customer 
relationships, developing a risk profile on the customer and performing 
ongoing monitoring and updates on customers. There have been no 
confirmed incidents of money laundering.Regarding promoting corporate governance in our portfolios, our analysts 
have a number of research tools at their disposal that allow them to examine 
the ethics of senior executives and alert them to potential governance and 
conflict-of-interest situations. Our culture demands the highest principles 
of accountability, honesty, integrity and ethics, plus a commitment to strong 
internal practices and policies.
Cybersecurity and Data Privacy
Maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our services and 
protecting our customers’ data is a top priority for the firm. Information 
security and data privacy has been identified as one of Franklin Templeton’s 
key enterprise risks, which receive significant dedicated resources and are 
continuously monitored. Our Chief Security Officer and our Chief Risk and 
Transformation Officer oversee our information security program and report to 
the Board of Directors on at least an annual basis.
Our cybersecurity program continuously adapts to rapidly evolving threat 
landscapes, regulatory requirements and technology innovation, guided by 
a framework of governance, program management, operations and program 
effectiveness. Our security operations teams leverage robust capabilities to 
identify, assess, detect and respond to cybersecurity risks and recover from 
potential incidents. We employ sophisticated protective, preventative and 
detective measures to protect our systems, testing the effectiveness of these 
controls through regular internal and independent external assessments,

representing financial institutions to collaborate and stay abreast of 
cybersecurity and data privacy developments.
All employees have a role in mitigating risk and preventing cyber-related 
issues. Our Corporate Information Security Policy and Program includes 
ongoing training for employees and contractors to preserve, improve and 
account for the confidentiality and integrity of the firm’s information. In 
addition to ongoing security awareness training, we leverage the opportunity 
of Cybersecurity Awareness Month to increase security education and 
communications for employees, contractors and clients.
Our approach to safeguarding our shareholders’ confidential information, 
including how our transfer agent manages “nonpublic personal” 
information and our disclosure policy and employee confidentiality and 
system security, is outlined in our privacy notice, which is provided to 
new shareholders and annually to existing shareholders. And, we have 
enhanced our vendor management oversight process to address additional 
outsourcing arrangements.Please visit the Global Citizenship page  of our website for

and its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company”) for fiscal year 2021 (October 1, 2020 through 
September 30, 2021), unless otherwise noted. 
This report does not address the performance or operations of our suppliers, contractors or partners. 
The information contained in this report has not been subject to external assurance from third parties. 
Many of the targets, goals, impacts and programs described in this report are aspirational, and as 
such, no guarantees or promises are made that these goals and projects will be met or successfully 
executed. 
In this report we may use certain terms that the Global Reporting Initiative, Sustainability Accounting 
Standards Board or others refer to as “material” to reflect the issues or priorities of Franklin Resources, 
Inc. and its stakeholders. Used in this context, however, these terms are distinct from, and should not 
be confused with, the terms “material” and “materiality” as defined by, or construed in accordance 
with, securities or other laws and regulations. Accordingly, issues or priorities considered material for 
purposes of this report may not be considered material in the context of our financial statements, 
reporting with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), or our other public statements. 
This report includes certain non-financial data and information that may be collected and measured 
using a variety of acceptable methods. The use of alternative acceptable measurement techniques  
to those used by the Company could result in materially different measurements of the non-financial 
data and information presented in this report. This report contains forward-looking statements that are provided under the “safe harbor” protection of 
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding our targets, goals, 
impacts, programs, and other business plans, initiatives and objectives. Forward-looking statements 
include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts and involve a number of 
known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause actual results 
and outcomes to differ materially from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such 
forward-looking statements. Such risks, uncertainties and other important factors include, without 
limitation, the degree of support of our stakeholders for our CSR initiatives or other challenges to 
the success of our CSR initiatives, and those described in our recent filings with the SEC, including, 
without limitation, in Risk Factors and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 
30, 2021 and our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. 
If a circumstance occurs after the date of the applicable report that causes any of our forward-
looking statements to be inaccurate, whether as a result of new information, future developments or 
otherwise, we undertake no obligation to announce publicly the change to our expectations, or to 
make any revision to our forward-looking statements, to reflect any change in assumptions, beliefs or 
expectations, or any change in events, conditions or circumstances upon which any forward-looking 
statement is based, unless required by law.

capital structure, mergers and corporate restructuring, environmental and social issues, governance matters, proxy access, and global corporate 
governance. As a global investor, Franklin Templeton recognizes that governance practices may vary by country, given local legal constraints and 
accepted market practices. With decades of investment experience and global research coverage, our analysts are skilled in understanding the 
complexities of the regions in which they specialize and are trained to analyze proxy issues germane to their regions.

Systemic Risk Management
Disclosure # Description Answer
FN-AC-550a.1 Percentage of open-end fund assets 
under management by category of 
liquidity classificationWe omit a response to this metric due to the SEC Rule 22e-4 amendment rescinding the requirement that open-end mutual funds disclose 
aggregate liquidity as it may pose a significant risk of confusing and misleading investors.
FN-AC-550a.2 Description of approach to 
incorporation of liquidity risk 
management programs into portfolio 
strategy and redemption risk 
managementThe Investment Risk Management group partners with each portfolio team on an ongoing basis to provide robust analytics and critical, 
independent insight on each portfolio’s risk profile, including liquidity risk.
The funds have implemented liquidity risk management programs (LRMP) in accordance with the regulatory requirements and/or guidance, as 
applicable. The Investment Risk Management group is responsible for the LRMPs.
The Risk group runs the Investment Liquidity Committee (ILC), a cross-functional committee to provide oversight and administration of the 
policies and procedures governing liquidity risk management programs across FT products and entities. The ILC reviews and approves 
liquidity reports and escalates issues, in accordance with its escalation procedures, and within the regulatory framework applicable to the 
relevant entity. The ILC will also meet on an ad-hoc basis when necessary to review potential significant liquidity events or stressed conditions 
and take appropriate steps to manage the risks, including implementing liquidity tools.
FN-AC-550a.3 Total exposure to securities financing 
transactionsFranklin Resources, Inc. does not engage in securities financing transactions as a principal but may be considered an agent. Our contractual 
obligations may subject us to indemnification costs and liability to third parties.
In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contracts with third parties, including, without limitation, clients, vendors, and other service 
providers, that contain a variety of representations and warranties and that provide for indemnifications by us in certain circumstances. 
Pursuant to such contractual arrangements, we may be subject to indemnification costs and liability to third parties if, for example, we breach 
any material obligations under the agreements or agreed standards of care, or in the event such third parties have certain legal claims 
asserted against them. The terms of these indemnities vary from contract to contract, and future indemnification claims against us could 
negatively impact our financial condition.
