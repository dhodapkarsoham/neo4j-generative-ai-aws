Corporate Responsibility Report 2019    | DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION  
Having a diverse workforce is vital to our mission of Building the Adaptable, Intelligent World. We foster a culture 
that embraces differences by searching for candidates, at all levels, from a wide range of backgrounds, ethnicities, 
abilities, and experiences. In addition, we also strive to create an environment where employees feel accepted, 
respected, and empowered.  
To achieve this, we offer employee programs that reinforce our values and provide opportunities for open 
participation and collaboration. We believe that all voices matter and encourage the sharing of different ideas  
and listening to perspectives as fuel for creativity, innovation, and belonging. Through regular surveys on our 
global employees’ experience, we leverage insights to build meaningful development and HR programs to foster 
an inclusive environment. Senior management hosts quarterly all-hands meetings to share business results and 
achievements where employees are encouraged to actively engage with questions and feedback. We empower our 
workforce to be curious, creative, and collaborative as part of our global LearnX program. Through this program,  
we offer numerous professional and personal development opportunities, including a self-directed learning 
platform with course offerings including career coaching, career planning, affirmative action, equal employment 
awareness, and unconscious bias training.  
In 2019, we further enhanced our commitment to workforce diversity when we launched our Women in Technology 
initiative. This initiative includes women’s development programs dedicated to increasing women’s representation 
in leadership positions, strategic partnerships with universities, and memberships in professional groups such 
as Watermark and AnitaB.org to further the advancement of women in technology. We encourage and support 
the development of our global Xilinx Women’s Groups, which are committed to the engagement, education, and 
empowerment of women in technology at Xilinx. We also pursue a diverse pool of future candidates by engaging in 
diversity outreach activities and seek to expand that pool by supporting various educational programs, including 
curriculum development in local high schools and universities.
At Xilinx, we proudly hire, develop, attract, and retain people of all backgrounds, beliefs, cultures, abilities,  
genders, sexual orientation, and veteran status. We take pride in and celebrate what makes our workforce  
different and unique.

Corporate Responsibility Report 2019    | ENVIRONMENT HEALTH AND SAFETY  
For over a decade, Xilinx has been third-party-certified to the ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 standards at our key 
operational sites which helps us continually improve our Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) Management System.
Our EHS Policy describes Xilinx’s strong culture of protecting the environment, and promoting a safe and healthy 
workplace. Our EHS culture is behind all of our environmentally-responsible corporate decisions and heightened 
awareness of climate change and water conservation concerns. Our leadership team is committed to ensuring the EHS 
Management System is embedded in the company’s One Xilinx culture and applied at all levels of the organization.
Our Employees Embrace Earth Day
More employees than ever are partnering with Xilinx in Earth Day events, making a difference in our workplace 
and communities. The annual events are celebrated globally to show support for protecting our environment 
and raising sustainability awareness. The growing amount of electronic waste produced each year has led  
to Xilinx Earth Day e-waste collections and recycling events. This year, almost 11,000 pounds (5,000 kgs)  
of e-waste was collected for recycling.

GLOBAL SUSTAINABLE BUILDING INITIATIVES
Our conservation efforts over the years have resulted in significant environmental design awards as well as industry 
and governmental certifications. These awards and certifications demonstrate our strong commitment to the 
environment and communities within which we conduct our business. Below are some highlights of our initiatives:  
Xilinx—Singapore
• In 2007 , the award-winning Xilinx Asia Pacific Headquarters became  
the first privately-owned industrial building in Singapore to be awarded  
the BCA Green Mark Platinum Award —the highest green building  
accolade by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA).
Xilinx—Colorado
• In 2002, our Colorado office was awarded the Colorado Renewable  
  Energy Society Award of Merit from the Architecture Institute of America.
• The design of the entire project inside and out, utilized concepts  
of sustainable architecture responsive to the area’s quality of life  
and employed energy conservation, use of “green” products,  
local materials, and water management. An indigenous habitat for  
wildlife was also enhanced for the existing prairie dog community.
Xilinx—San Jose (Corporate Headquarters)
• In 2007 , received the Leadership in Energy and  
   Environmental Design (LEED) Award for the  
   renovation of a 72,000 sq ft building.
• In 2016, completed the renovation of a 113,000 sq ft 
building with design focused on energy efficiency  
and sustainability which has allowed net zero  
energy levels to be achieved in 100% of the  
building’s office spaces.

 17
Corporate Responsibility Report 2019    | Climate Change Efforts
Emission data is tracked for our major sites, including our corporate headquarters 
in San Jose, Colorado, Ireland, Singapore, and Hyderabad. We have set a Carbon 
Reduction Goal of 10% by end of CY2019, beginning with our baseline of CY2014. 
Currently, we have exceeded this goal and are at 27% carbon reduction per 
headcount (normalized data).
Xilinx has been a member of the EPA ’s Green Power Partner list since 2005, 
helping to support the development of renewable energy while also helping 
protect the environment. In addition, Xilinx purchases renewable energy 
certificates (RECs) in the U.S. On average, 3,073 mWh is purchased every year. For 
every kilowatt hour of RECs purchased by Xilinx, an equal amount of electricity 
from renewable resources is being delivered to the electricity grid, helping to 
offset the generation of electricity from other more polluting sources such as oil, 
natural gas, and coal.
Energy Management
We undertake a variety of actions, including energy conservation projects, sustainable 
building initiatives, and renewable energy use to achieve green house gas emission 
reduction results. As a fabless semiconductor company, the sustainable operation of 
our office buildings accounts for the majority of our environmental impact, therefore 
Xilinx consistently reviews the latest technologies while tracking data trends from an 
energy reduction and water management perspective for improved results.
Energy reduction efforts include:
Intelligent Energy-Effi cient Cooling Systems  
• Ambient air cooling systems used to reduce and  
  offset energy use in Data Centers and Lab environments
• Dynamic controls that adjust set points based on outside  
  weather conditions optimize comfort and energy usage   
   for office environments
• Control systems monitor and notify when out-of-tolerance  
   conditions could cause run-away energy consumption
Passive Energy-Efficient Building Features
• Reflective roofing systems reflect up to 88% of the sun’s energy, allowing for less mechanical cooling  
energy to be consumed
• Rooftop solar hot water collectors offset water heating energy (Singapore Office)
• Architectural features such as awnings and trellis works to minimize solar gain into buildings
• Semi-external building areas used for informal meeting and gathering areas use natural ventilation  
in lieu of traditional cooling systems
Energy-Saving Technologies  
• High efficiency critical power protection equipment (San Jose Campus)
• Environmentally-friendly TL5 and LED lamps and controls for scheduling 
• Occupancy sensors in meeting rooms, restrooms, and copy rooms
• High efficiency electrical transformers
• Energy monitoring/management software that helps identify and quantify potential energy saving opportunities

Corporate Responsibility Report 2019    | 
Water Management 
As a fabless semiconductor company, we are not a major water consumer, but we 
still believe every little bit of conservation helps in our target of demonstrating a yearly reduction trend even with increasing headcount.
Water Conservation Projects 
• Weather-based irrigation controls
• H2O Utilization Awareness Program
• Strategic abandonment of landscape irrigation due to drought conditions
• Low-flow fixture retrofits
Waste Management 
As part of our ongoing efforts to be responsible eco-citizens, we implemented 
a waste reduction program to reduce waste from our daily operations sent to landfills and encourage global employee engagement in recycling activities. Overall, waste reduction efforts at our major sites have resulted in significant improvements for recycled and compost waste versus landfill wastes and we are 
on target for a continued trend of yearly reduction with increasing headcount. 
Employee Safety Management
To prevent workplace injuries, we provide initial and ongoing health- and safety-related training, in addition to ergonomic evaluations, that meet global regulatory requirements and internal best management practices aimed 
to protect the health and well-being of our employees.
Xilinx uses the Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR)  
calculation to measure the number of Occupational  
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) workplace  
injuries that occur each calendar yea r. Due to our  
focused initiatives on managing risk, we have a low  
injury rate as shown in the chart with our target being 
well below the Semiconductor Manufacturing injury  
rate as published by the US Department of Labor.
Hazardous Waste
As a fabless semiconductor company we generate minimal  
hazardous waste stemming from R&D efforts at Xilinx facilities. Hazardous waste disposal at our Corporate Headquarters in  San Jose is well below the EPA requirements for Conditionally  Exempt Small Quantity Generators (accumulate less than 2,200 pounds (1,000 kgs) at any one time).

XILINX UNIVERSITY PROGRAM (XUP)
 
Xilinx devices are used extensively for teaching and research in universities and colleges all over the world. In 
Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science and Physics, especially, our products are used for best-
in-class teaching, state-of-the-art research, and in diverse start-ups. The use of Xilinx integrated circuits is so 
widespread in engineering and science education that, as one expert commented, “They might have been designed 
for education rather than for industry.” 
Each year, XUP team members in North America, Europe, and Asia empower thousands of professors and hundreds 
of thousands of students worldwide. We provide access to our latest hardware and software technologies; training 
and workshops; design contests and hackathons. 
An excellent example of this industry-academia collaboration is the newly released book  
“Exploring Zynq MPSoC With PYNQ and Machine Learning Applications,” which was  
co-authored by a team led by Prof. Bob Stewart and Dr. Louise Crockett, at the University  
of Strathclyde in Glasgow, Scotland ( https://www.zynq-mpsoc-book.com ). As Xilinx  
continues to pioneer new systems-on-chips and software-defined technologies, we will  
also continue to empower professors and their students to innovate and realize ever  
more ambitious dreams. This synergy between academia and industry is essential to  
ensuring that new graduates are equipped with the most relevant, up-to-date education  
and that postgraduates can continue to pursue groundbreaking research.
In this post Moore’s Law era, XUP is at the forefront of introducing heterogenous  
computing in academia. New board level solutions, such as Alveo, are powering  
cloud-based and on-premise compute acceleration, with tools designed for  
software developers. 
XUP actively champions multiple Women in Technology initiatives in partnership with Xilinx’ Human Resources 
department. Further details on the Xilinx University Program are available at www.xilinx.com/xup , and you can
