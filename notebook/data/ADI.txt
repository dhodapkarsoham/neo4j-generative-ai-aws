PREVIOUS NEXTMESSAGE FROM OUR CEO
2020 will be remembered as one of the most profound years in our 
lifetime. The COVID-19 pandemic gripped our world, fundamentally reshaped global communities and economies, and turned our sense of normality upside down. It required us to rethink how we work and engage with each other while exposing the fragilities in our society, both in terms of social inequities as well as our climate.
At ADI, we are driven by our purpose to “engineer good.” This simple 
yet consequential idea guides everything we do. We engineer good for our customers, helping to solve their toughest problems. But we also engineer good for the world around us by tackling society’s most complex challenges.
This purpose came to life in a unique way during 2020. Faced with a 
once-in-a-lifetime global pandemic, our priority was to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees while continuing to deliver for our customers. As the pandemic revealed the vulnerability  of our global healthcare system, we mobilized quickly to help  meet the needs of the medical community. We prioritized the production of our healthcare solutions and partnered with  
hospitals and biotech startups to develop new ones. Through  the Analog Devices Foundation, we made a $4 million donation to  
the World Health Organization (WHO)’s Solidarity Response Fund,  which served to support countries to prevent, detect, and respond  
to the pandemic. We donated $500,000 to the Massachusetts General Hospital’s Vaccine & Immunotherapy Center to help advance vaccine development and novel point-of-care testing technologies for COVID-19. And we partnered with international advocacy organization Global Citizen on a televised and streamed special, “One World: Together At Home,” and raised $55 million towards the WHO’s Solidarity Response Fund.

2020 ANALOG DEVICES CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT4
PREVIOUS NEXTThe year also brought into sharp focus the grave consequences 
of climate crisis and environmental degradation. Semiconductors, as the bedrock of the modern digital economy, play a major role in improving our standard of living while protecting our planetary health. ADI’s sensing technologies support smart grids that enable the electric vehicle infrastructure and our industry-leading Battery Management Solutions drive significant emission reductions  
while supporting the drive towards longer range vehicles. Both solutions play a critical role in enabling the transition towards a  low-carbon economy. 
Our impact also includes the ambitions we set for ourselves. We  
have committed to be carbon neutral by 2030 and achieve zero 
emissions by 2050. These goals consist of setting Science-Based 
Targets, ensuring our purpose is rooted in climate science, and 
that these are verified by trusted third parties. Recognizing the need to maximize our impact, we are also committed to inclusive collaboration. For example, we are partnering with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution to launch the Ocean and Climate Innovation Accelerator. This initiative places special focus on the health and regeneration of our oceans, which play a critical role in regulating the Earth’s climate. The Accelerator will serve as a multi-stakeholder consortium focused on creating “solution engines” to restore our oceans and mitigate climate change. 
I firmly believe that varied voices and perspectives lead to better 
outcomes, and we are committed to providing all our employees with the freedom, opportunity, and support they need to make an impact. During 2020 we placed an increased focus on our empowerment strategy by expanding the diversity of our workforce, broadening growth and development opportunities, and fostering an inclusive environment for all. In 2021 we intend to increase the number of women and underrepresented populations throughout the company and specifically in management while continuing our commitment to pay parity across the globe. 
As we start off the new year, I am encouraged by our achievements 
we made in 2020 and am energized by the opportunities ahead to further extend and expand our impact and achieve a more connected, greener, healthier, and safer future. MESSAGE FROM OUR CEO
The pandemic also shined a light on deep 
disparities that still exist within our society, further underlining ADI’s commitment to building a diverse, equitable, and inclusive organization.

PREVIOUS NEXTEMPOWERING PEOPLE
For more than five decades, ADI has led our industry by building a 
culture that celebrates the creation of products and services that solve our customers’ and our society’s most pressing and complex challenges. This has never felt more relevant or more important  
than during this past year.
Guided by our purpose to engineer good, our organization and our 
people rose to meet the many challenges that 2020 presented us.
As COVID spread around the globe, our first priority was the safety 
and support of our employees. As a manufacturer of medical products that were deemed essential, we quickly put measures in place to protect the health and well-being of employees in our manufacturing operations, and like most companies, we transitioned remaining employees to remote-work environments. We enacted a global Emergency Coronavirus Paid Time Off (ECPTO) program so that employees could comply with self-quarantine requirements without concerns about undue financial burdens.
Throughout the pandemic, we have been amazed by the resiliency 
and creativity of our employees, who found ways to collaborate and innovate, even while working remote. We found that Zoom 
calls with global colleagues fostered a sense of belonging and inclusion among participants. And our engineers created a virtual platform for sharing ideas and having “drop by” conversations which sparked new ideas and solutions to difficult problems.
It has been inspiring to see how rapidly and effectively our colleagues adapted to the “new normal.” And while we will always remain an organization that believes in the importance of being together, this past year taught us valuable lessons as we discern our next steps, including more hybrid work arrangements.

pandemic exacerbated and exposed the deep inequities that continue to exist in our society. Added to that were continued cases of racial injustice, including those that resulted in the tragic and unnecessary loss of life. Yet,  as appalling and painful as last year’s events were, the year also saw a groundswell of action.
At ADI, we launched a new Employee Resource Group 
(ERG) focused on elevating and prioritizing the unique needs of people of color and creating opportunities to support colleagues from underrepresented groups.  The People of Color and Allies Network (POCAN) broadens our network of ERGs, including the Women’s Leadership Network and LGBTQ+ Network, which will all contribute to our broader DEI initiatives as well as engage ADI leaders to ensure policies and practices  are conducive to diversity and inclusion for employees  of all backgrounds.
In addition, we are broadening our recruitment efforts to 
attract more diverse talent to our organization. In 2021, we made new commitments to increase the number  of women and underrepresented populations in the company. Specifically in board and management  roles, we’ve increased our board leadership to nearly 30% female and our executive management team is 20% female leadership. 
All told, 2020 was a profoundly challenging year for 
the world collectively and for each of us individually. I have never been prouder to be part of ADI’s team of compassionate and tenacious individuals. As we deliver against our ambition to be the preferred destination for the world’s best talent, we will continue to invest in building an inclusive environment that provides our teams with the freedom and opportunity to accelerate their impact and empower them to engineer good for both people and the planet. I have great confidence in our employees and our future.

employees striving to achieve the same goals creates a common drive for excellence and celebrating achievement. 
Pay Equity 
We are committed to equitable compensation regardless of gender, race, or ethnicity. Our goal is to attain 100% pay equity. To this end, we conduct regular equal pay assessments, with rigorous statistical analyses of employees performing similar work and active plans to adjust where appropriate. In the U.S., women currently earn 98 cents for every $1 earned by their male counterparts; notably, we don’t see a systemic pattern of women being underpaid in the same jobs. Similar analysis of  racial pay differences in the U.S. found the same  98 cents/$1 ratio for people of color. Also, we monitor our worldwide adjusted compensation  
for women compared to men, working to adjust within local practices.EMPOWERING PEOPLE

GOOD GOVERNANCE
RISK OVERSIGHT 
Our risk management framework defines how we identify, 
manage and govern risk throughout our organization, promoting our financial and operational goals in a compliant manner. This assigns accountability for risk management to every business unit, based on the risk encountered as part of the day-to-day operations. Risk governance is managed by our Chief Legal Officer and Chief Financial Officer, in partnership with the senior leadership team. Members of management report to the Board of Directors or the appropriate committee in the case of risks that are under the purview of a particular committee regarding a risk identification, risk management and risk mitigation strategies. 
The Board of Directors’ role in our risk oversight process 
includes receiving regular reports to senior management on areas of material risk to the company. Specifically, our Chief Legal Officer reports to our full Board of Directors regarding management of all enterprise and operational risks and our risk management framework annually, with periodic updates on focus areas, such as cybersecurity. The Board also receives regular updates from our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee in Nominating and Corporate Governess Committee, which provide our Board with thorough insight about how ADI manages risk.

Ethical behavior has been a core tenet of our Company’s values since 
our earliest days. Our employees, across all locations and job functions, have internalized the value of ethical behavior, routinely going beyond mere compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Employees have a mandatory training on our Code of Ethics and are then re-certified the following years. It is reviewed for necessary changes or amendments on an annual basis by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors. Our long history of leadership in the area of governance and ethics has resulted in a trusted reputation among our customers, investors and employees, as well as the communities where we operate. Depending on their roles and geographic locations, certain employees are assigned more in-depth ethics and compliance training  on topics.
View our entire Analog Devices Code of Business Conduct and EthicsWe are proud of not only our history 
of excellence in our products and solutions, but also the ethical tenet of our business practices and people. This has allowed us to build a strong foundation of trust with our customers, employees, partners  and shareholders.Employees and stakeholders have several options to report potential 
violations of laws, rules, regulations and Company policies. We have an open-door policy with regard to issues that may arise under the Code or about potential violations. Employees may bring these issues to their supervisors, their supervisor’s managers, their human resources representative, any member of human resources or ADI’s Senior Vice President and General Counsel. In addition, we have a toll-free and confidential business ethics hotline operated by an independent third party.
Employees, as well as external parties such as customers, suppliers,  
or members of the communities in which we operate, may anonymously  
report any potential violations through these channels. Following a report, 
ADI’s Legal Department oversees an investigation appropriate for the situation. Anonymous reports and the results of any investigation are reported to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. This third-party reporting website and hotline information can be accessed  
at ADI Ethics Point .
ADI believes human rights are the fundamental rights, freedoms, and standards of treatment to which all people are entitled. Respect for human rights is rooted in our values and applies wherever we do business.  
ADI’s Human Rights Principles  document formalizes ADI’s commitment to 
respect human rights and summarizes our policies. ADI’s Human Rights Principles apply to all employees and contingent workers, our products and services, and our business relationships, including our supply chains. ADI has a number of additional policies that also guide action in specific areas such as safety and privacy, the supply chain, and environmental health. GOOD GOVERNANCE

Our policy regarding the trading of securities is applicable to all ADI 
personnel, as well as our Board of Directors. Appropriate employees 
are required to take a mandatory online course covering our insider 
trading rules. Appropriate employees are also reminded quarterly via 
email of their obligations to refrain from trading in Company stock 
during blackout periods.Fair Competition and Pricing 
ADI and its employees do not discuss prices or customers with our 
competitors except when necessary in connection with legitimate 
sales or purchase transactions. In addition, ADI and its personnel do 
not fix or dictate resale prices to our distributors or pressure resale 
price maintenance by reprimanding or threatening distributors who 
reduce their prices. We are fair in our dealings with our distributors and 
do not restrict our distributors’ rights to sell our products, nor do we 
seek to prevent our distributors from selling our competitors’ products. 
We do not discriminate among similar distributors when we offer 
price discounts. ADI had zero legal actions related to anticompetitive 
behavior, antitrust or monopoly practices in the reporting period.

core company value, and the RBA Code supports our commitment to 
upholding the highest ethical standards in how we conduct business.Cybersecurity 
ADI has developed an Enterprise Cybersecurity Program based on 
industry standards such as those published by ISO and NIST. We 
provide regular security awareness and training to our workforce  
to help them identify cyber concerns and take the appropriate  
actions. Cybersecurity is an important component of the ADI Risk  
Management Framework. This includes periodic reporting to both  
the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors. More information  
can be found in the Analog Devices Information Security Statement .Export Controls

PREVIOUS NEXTSUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT POLICIES & DOCUMENTS
Our goal is to develop strategic, impactful 
and agile relationships with ADI suppliers. Our products require a wide variety of components, raw materials, wafer foundry, assembly and test services—much of which is purchased from  third-party suppliers. We have multiple sources for many components and materials that are purchased and incorporated into our products. However, a large portion of our external wafer purchases and foundry services are from a limited number of suppliers, primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. ADI’s purchasing organization has a procedure for purchasing materials from suppliers. Where feasible, raw materials and critical indirect materials are either dual sourced or have an identified second source. The ADI purchasing organization, in conjunction with the Subcontractor Management Organization, oversees the work of wafer foundries and test and assembly subcontractors. ADI has developed a series of specifications to define the ADI supplier management policy for materials and services.

ADI workers do not participate in occupational activities with high incidence or high risk of specific diseases, which has resulted in no known or reported incidents in this area.
ADI’s industrial hygiene surveillance program minimizes and prevents exposures in the workplace and reduces the risk of specific diseases. We use 
two industry standard metrics to assess injury performance and trends worldwide.
All legacy ADI sites have ISO 45001 health and safety certification, while sites from our acquisition of Linear Technology are working towards 
certification to the same standard.
