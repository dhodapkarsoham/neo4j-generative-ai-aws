A MESSAGE FROM NISH VARTANIAN,  
CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT AND CEO
Fit for the Future
Social responsibility is not new to MSA—it’s been at the heart of our mission since 1914. 
We are, after all, a company solely dedicated to helping protect the world’s workers. So 
when the pandemic hit, our top priority was to ensure the safety of our associates who 
continued to report to our facilities each day. Together, we provided safety products to 
critical industries, including first responders, energy providers, utilities, transportation, food 
manufacturing, and pharmaceuticals so they, in turn, could continue to operate safely. And 
while 2020 brought with it many lessons — more than I can recount here — I’d like to focus 
on a few themes that resonated with me over the past year. 
First, the importance of worker safety has never been more apparent. We saw humanity embrace efforts to keep essential workers 
safe. Terms like “PPE, ” known widely in industry, quickly became a part of everyday conversation. And we also gained a new 
appreciation for the connectedness of our global economy. 
In essence, the pandemic illuminated what we have always known at MSA — that worker safety is inseparably linked to 
community health, and, ultimately, our global economic wellbeing. As “The Safety Company, ” we know this a tremendous 
responsibility. But it’s that responsibility that inspires us to develop new-to-world technologies that help enable our customers to 
return home safely each night. That’s who we are. That’s what we do. 
Second, it’s even more apparent today that many issues traditionally associated with “corporate social responsibility” are truly 
issues of corporate strategy. In my 2020 Annual Letter to Shareholders, I noted that our investments in worker safety, talent, 
environmental sustainability, and supply chain resiliency all help to create a better business model. This is something I believe 
deeply. The companies who do these things consistently well are going to be the ones who succeed — the ones that are  
fit for the future.
In 2021, we continue to make strategic investments in each of these areas. As an example, we’re undertaking a stakeholder 
materiality assessment to help increase transparency on how we prioritize and advance our key social and sustainability 
commitments. We’re also refreshing our diversity & inclusion strategy, and we’re developing a long-term climate risk strategy. 
Why focus on these areas? On talent development and diversity & inclusion, we’re keenly aware that attracting and retaining 
a quality workforce through sustainable talent pipelines is one of the top business challenges for any organization today, and 
particularly for manufacturing companies, who are expected to have 2.1 million unfilled jobs by 2030.1 Simply put, we can’t make 
great products without great people. More broadly speaking, safety unites us. And while we’re focused on a single mission, we 
cannot be single-minded. An openness to individuality — where diverse people and ideas are welcome — will be at the heart of 
our success in the coming years. That’s because we know that our people are as unique and innovative as the products we create. 
Those very differences can make all the difference as we design safety solutions fit for the diverse needs of workers in dozens of 
countries, industries, and applications.

2
On sustainability, we recognize that in the coming decades every company’s business model will be affected by climate risk 
and the global efforts to address it. We have a part to play in this effort as well. For that reason, we’re developing a climate 
risk strategy, informed by standards set by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. And while our operations 
include light manufacturing and assembly, we continue to build the necessary internal infrastructure to measure and 
reduce our global carbon footprint, as our sustainability teams make improvements in areas such as supply chain, logistics, 
packaging, and recycling. Lastly, we’re working to incorporate sustainability principles into our new product development 
processes and to ensure that our market-leading safety technologies meet the needs of diversified, well-balanced energy 
end markets. 
Finally, we’re continuing to enhance a variety of risk oversight and business continuity programs to address both traditional 
and non-traditional risks. In addition to the efforts above, this includes enhancements to crisis and enterprise risk 
management programs, cyber and data governance strategies, business ethics and code of conduct trainings, and more.  
We also recognize the need for robust supply chain management, so for our top suppliers, we’re deepening our review of 
risk and resiliency indicators. Without reservation, I’ll say that these programs will always be “works in progress, ” as they must 
continuously transform to meet the moment. Together, these efforts help us to build greater resiliency and adaptability into 
our overall business model, to help safeguard the value that we create for MSA’s many stakeholders. These are just some 
of the many investments we’re making this year to be fit for the future, as we go forward into a world that is increasingly 
interconnected. 
In closing, I’d like to express my gratitude to our entire MSA team, which stayed focused on our mission, our people, and 
our customers, and communities. In a world that’s forever changed, I’m enthusiastic about the investments we’re making 
this year to be an organization that is truly fit for the future. I’m also optimistic about our outlook — not only for MSA as an 
organization, but for our world in general. Certainly, there are challenges ahead, but there’s also a tremendous opportunity 
to harness these times to collectively build the future world in which we want to live. At MSA, that means creating long-
term value for all of our stakeholders, building a better business model which in turn will continue to deliver returns for 
shareholders. And at a time when the importance of worker safety has never been more apparent, we stand ready to help 
others as they too build safer, thriving organizations for safer tomorrows.

Our Socially  
Responsible Mission 
For more than a century, MSA’s mission has been to see to 
it that men and women may work in safety and that they, 
their families, and their communities may live in health 
throughout the world. This is at the center of everything 
we do.      
On the morning of March 26, 1912, the Jed Mine in West 
Virginia exploded. In a flash, methane gas ignited, and 
more than 80 miners lost their lives. From this tragedy, mine engineer and MSA cofounder John T. Ryan Sr. had 
an epiphany: “If I could spend my life doing what I can to 
lessen the likelihood of the occurrence of such terrible 
disasters, I shall feel in the end that my life had been well 
spent. ”
Ever since that fateful day, MSA has helped to keep 
workers safe and lessen disasters all over the world with 
our innovative and life-saving products.

Our Life-Saving Products
As a global leader in the development, manufacture, 
and supply of safety products that protect people and 
facility infrastructures, many MSA products integrate 
electronics, mechanical systems, and advanced materials 
to help protect users against hazardous or life-threatening 
situations. 
 Our products include self-contained breathing apparatus, 
fixed gas and flame detection systems, portable gas 
detection instruments, industrial head protection products, 
firefighter helmets and protective apparel, and fall 
protection devices. They are used by workers around the 
world in a broad range of markets and industries, including 
fire service, oil, gas, petrochemical, construction, mining, 
and the military.

CSR Program Governance  
Our Corporate Social Responsibility framework focuses 
on Our Integrity, Our People, Our Environment, and Our 
Communities. The Company’s CSR programs are holistically 
incorporated into enterprise-wide programs, driven by the 
work of each functional team, globally. These programs are 
coordinated by a CSR steering team — a cross-functional 
group of global leaders — who establish and execute the 
Company’s CSR programs. The CSR Steering Team regularly provides reports to the 
Company’s Executive Leadership Team and is sponsored by 
the Company’s Vice President & Chief Legal Officer.
The MSA Board places a continued focus on the corporate 
governance affairs of the Company, including Corporate 
Social Responsibility. The Nominating and Corporate 
Governance Committee maintains oversight of MSA’s CSR 
program. It receives updates three times each year, with the 
full Board receiving reports two times each year.2020 CORPORATE SOCIAL

OUR COVID
RESPONSE

Production workers at MSA Mexico are celebrated at an associate appreciation event.
Keeping Our Associates Safe
Throughout the pandemic, we have worked to protect 
the health and well-being of our associates — especially 
those who continued to work each day to manufacture 
safety products to help keep our customers and essential 
workers safe.
In response to the pandemic, MSA formed a COVID-19 
Response Team. The team implemented new safety 
protocols in conjunction with evolving guidelines of 
leading health organizations.
Essential Worker Appreciation
Our production teams continue to fulfill our mission 
inside our manufacturing sites, so our Production 
Workforce Appreciation Team made sure their critical 
contributions were not overlooked. Free lunches were 
provided to production associates for four months to 
thank them for their commitment to our mission, and 
numerous associates participated in appreciation events 
like “Chalk the Walk, ” sending messages of inspiration 
and gratitude on the outdoor walkways leading into 
production facilities.
 COVID-19 AND THE MISSION OF MSA

MSA 2020 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
8
Keeping Our Communities Safe
Early in the pandemic, MSA recognized the need for
personal protective equipment (PPE) in the global fight
against COVID-19. In the first few months of the 
pandemic, MSA donated approximately 140,000 N95 
disposable respirators to healthcare agencies and 
government entities in Germany, France, Ireland, Brazil, 
U.S., China, Australia, Mexico, and more.
Essential Work
In 2020, it was our job to ensure we were there to support 
our customers, especially those in critical industries and 
“frontline” occupations. Throughout the pandemic, we 
supplied safety products to first responders, energy 
providers, utilities, transportation, food manufacturing, 
and pharmaceuticals, so these critical industries could 
continue to protect their workers. We also accelerated innovation for pandemic-influenced 
safety technologies to help protect essential workers.
Unique Safety Solutions for Unique Times
In 2020, we continued to focus on strategic new product 
development priorities across our core product areas, 
while also meeting emerging safety needs created by the 
pandemic.
One example is our new V-TEC® io1 smart self-retracting 
lifeline. A smart fall protection device, it was designed 
specifically to help protect warehouse order pickers. The 
pandemic rapidly increased demand for online order 
fulfillment, which also increased the number of new 
warehouse workers working at heights. 
MSA also worked throughout the year with healthcare
professionals to understand the respiratory protection 
needs of those on the front line of the pandemic, and 
to accelerate the development of new, reusable, air- 
purifying respirators.
Seeing the “PPE insecurity” concerns of healthcare 
workers around the world led us to design an innovative 
reusable respirator, launched in 2021, specifically for 
emergency preparedness applications.
The MSA Advantage® 290 Respirator is the first NIOSH-
approved, reusable respirator designed to filter  
both inhaled and exhaled breath, an important 
feature allowing for more widespread 
adoption in infectious disease scenarios.
Our reusable respirators helped support 
frontline healthcare workers in 2020 
and will help support better emergency 
preparedness in the future. Reusable 
respirators are also an environmentally 
sustainable option, dramatically 
reducing waste associated 
with single-use masks.
When the pandemic 
first hit in Wuhan, 
China, MSA 
associates took 
immediate action 
and donated all 
available safety 
goggles to the 
Wuhan Red Cross 
Association.
MSA Mexico partnered with the Mexican Red Cross to do an initiative 
called, ‘Llamadas de Ayuda’ (Calls for Help), making it possible for COVID-19 
patients to video call with their loved ones while in the hospital. MSA also 
donated PPE to the Mexican Red Cross.

MSA 2020 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
11
ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE 
MSA maintains a robust 
ethics and compliance
program to ensure we 
remain committed 
to our foundational 
value of integrity. Our 
commitment to integrity is clear to our customers, our 
supply chain partners, our other business partners, and 
our associates.
All associates are responsible for acting with integrity
and upholding our values and mission. The Company 
maintains a longstanding Global Code of Business 
Conduct (the “Code”), which is a vital resource for all 
associates.
The Code sets forth core requirements for ethics and 
compliance and is available in multiple languages to ensure a full understanding throughout our operations. 
The Code provides associates with useful tools such as 
hypotheticals they may face in day-to-day work, and how 
associates should respond to 
complicated situations. 
We also maintain policies and 
procedures related to an array 
of compliance topics such as 
antitrust, anti-bribery and anti-
corruption, import and export 
laws, trade sanctions, and 
insider trading, among others. 
All salaried associates receive Code of Conduct training 
every year, along with a Code of Conduct certification. 
Associates also receive targeted education on other 
compliance topics.99%  
of active salaried 
associates completed 
Code of Conduct 
training in 2020.
In 2020, Ethics Guideline reports were received from 15 different 
countries, reflecting a wide global reach.

12
Ethics Guideline
The MSA Ethics Guideline is a telephone and internet
resource available for associates to ask questions or report
concerns 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in their local 
language. Those who contact the Ethics Guideline have 
the option to provide their name or remain anonymous.
All reports to the Ethics Guideline are reviewed promptly, 
with sensitivity and discretion. The Company maintains
processes and procedures to prevent retaliation and will
not, under any circumstances, tolerate retaliation against
anyone for raising a good-faith concern.
RISK MANAGEMENT 
The Company maintains a variety of risk oversight 
programs to help drive enterprise resiliency.
Enterprise Risk Management  
Our ERM program is designed to enable identification and 
management of critical enterprise risks and to incorporate 
risk considerations into decision making. We assess the major risks facing the Company and work
with the Executive Leadership Team and others 
responsible for managing each risk to identify and 
consider appropriate mitigation elements to each risk, 
while developing risk contingency plans as appropriate. 
Crisis Management
MSA also maintains a robust but adaptive Crisis 
Management Program that aligns with our mission and 
values and involves the necessary people quickly in the 
event of a crisis. The Crisis Management Program enables 
MSA to promptly respond to crises in order to protect the 
health and safety of our associates, customers, facilities, 
and other stakeholders.
Information Security
The MSA Information Security organization works to 
protect the Company’s networks, systems, data,
intellectual property, and personal information. Our
Information Security Governance framework includes a
variety of policies and standards governing computing
environments.
We deploy many techniques and technologies to 
manage and search for cyber threats to our computing 
environments and products. Our internal training and 
awareness programs include training modules and 
simulations for all associates. We regularly evaluate new 
technologies to enhance our security posture while 
maintaining a strong focus on risk reduction. We also work 
to evaluate and reduce risk for data handled within our 
supplier network.
Finally, we participate in cybersecurity information-
sharing programs — engaging with industry, suppliers, 
customers, and government agencies to help protect our 
cyber assets.

SECTION 3
OUR  
PEOPLE
Although MSA has received this recognition eight times since 2013, this past year marked the first 
time the Company was ranked as the #1 overall Top Workplace in the large company category. 
MSA’s Chairman, President and CEO, Nish Vartanian, was also honored with a Post-Gazette 
Leadership Award.
America’s Best Employers were selected based on an independent survey of 50,000 employees 
in 25 different industries, working for companies with at least 1,000 people employed in their U.S. 
locations. Participants were asked open-ended questions regarding their own employer, and the 
evaluation was based on both direct and indirect recommendations. Of this list of 500 companies, 
MSA ranked 16th overall, and Number 1 of the 31 companies grouped in the Engineering, 
Manufacturing Industry category — placing MSA near the top of all midsize employers nationwide. 
This recognition was based on a survey of more than 50,000 employees working for companies 
employing at least 1,000 people in their U.S. operations. Respondents were asked questions 
regarding the topics of age, gender equality, ethnicity, disability, LGBTQA+ and general diversity 
concerning their own employer.
MSA was awarded a “Strong Award” for its commitment to diversity and inclusion and for the 
contributions of several MSA women leaders who played key roles in MSA’s response to the 
COVID-19 crisis. The “Strong Awards” were established to recognize Pittsburgh-based businesses 
that demonstrate a commitment to diversity and inclusion, while also calling attention to 
important achievements made by women and girls in our community. 
Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum – Mining Safety Leadership Medal 
2021 In developing MSA’s first product in 1914, Thomas Edison found a way to adapt new 
battery technology to power a light that was worn on top of a miner’s hard hat. Today, that same 
passion to find new uses for technology is powering innovations like the MSA LUNAR™ system 
for firefighters and the “smart” gas detectors and fall protection devices. For this reason, it was 
gratifying for MSA to be honored as the 2021 recipient of the Mining Safety Leadership Medal. 
In going back to MSA’s roots, this award recognizes exceptional contributions by an individual 
or organization towards improving mining health and safety — within the Canadian mining 
industry — through innovative means.

14
At MSA, we promote personal responsibility for workplace 
safety and encourage associates to set a meaningful 
example as safety ambassadors.
Associate health and safety is embedded into our culture. 
It is in our processes and procedures, and management 
leads by example in setting these practices. We also have 
safety metrics maintained at all levels of the organization. 
Other proactive measures include management and 
investigation, near hits, ergonomics, housekeeping, and 
risk assessments. 
 One program that impacts all levels of the organization is 
the Company’s Near Hit process. The Near Hit process is an 
important component to workplace safety accountability, 
making it a part of our everyday discussions. Through the 
Near Hit reporting process, associates are encouraged to 
report potentially unsafe conditions they believe could 
result in an injury. This Near Hit accountability mindset 
extends to the entire organization, empowering our 5,000 
associates to report and correct potential hazards. 
On average, each associate identified two Near Hits with 
potential injury consequences and resolved the situation
before an incident could happen.

Giving through Training
Our trainers are passionate about spreading safety 
knowledge and awareness. For example, in 2020, our 
training instructors partnered with the U.K. Institution of 
Occupational Safety and Health to conduct a free safety 
webinar for more than 1,200 participants. 

18
The MSA Leader Model
The MSA Leader Model was created to clarify and enhance the expectations of our leaders at MSA. 
It outlines the traits, knowledge, competencies, and experiences that MSA requires for successful 
leadership while encouraging leaders to remain true to their personal styles. In 2020, the New 
Leader Onboarding Program was offered virtually to all new leaders across the globe.
Project Leader
MSA Project Leader: MSA Project Leader is a targeted learning experience designed to help 
beginner and mid-level project and program managers augment their skillsets over a six-to-nine-
month period. Participants learn foundational project management skills through classroom 
content, on-the-job practice and reflection, mentoring, 
and peer coaching. Participants of the program also 
engage in content centered on leadership, influencing, 
emotional intelligence, leading innovation, and business and financial strategy.
This program was expanded in 2020 with three cohorts meeting concurrently 
across the globe. The global nature of the 2020 program included 
opportunities for cross-regional mentoring to form stronger partnerships 
across the world. In total, 61 associates graduated from the program.
MOVE
The MOVE Performance Management philosophy is a core element of MSA’s continued success. 
Meaningful, Ongoing, Vital Exchanges (MOVE) between associates and supervisors provide 
a flexible feedback loop to increase the engagement of all associates. Associates share their 
challenges and successes with their supervisor in a way that allows problems to be addressed 
more quickly and fosters more collaboration and efficiency than any previous performance 
management system. By breaking free of the structure of traditional performance management, 
MSA places conversations at the heart of our associate development and growth strategies. 
These 1:1 conversations were as important as ever in 2020. While we’ve had this framework in place for several years, 
associates and managers stayed better connected through a period of rapid change and used this time to work through 
issues together while often working remotely. With an open forum to voice concerns, the MSA team stayed connected, 
engaged, and productive during the most challenging of circumstances. 
BUILDING TRUST INSPIRING PERFORMANCELEADERSHIP AND DEVELOPMENT
MSA is committed to helping our associates take on newer, higher, more challenging and rewarding roles within the 
organization. We use our Leader Model and other associate leadership and development programs to further enhance  
opportunities for growth.
MSA 2020 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT
19
Connected Leadership Network
2020 prompted us to reflect on the connections we need to make and maintain in order to 
continue to work effectively. Connected Leadership Network is a new development program in 
which leaders from across the globe sign up for a series of discussions on specific topics such 
as Thriving in Change and Leading by Empowering. In total, more than 100 global leaders from 
every MSA region were elected to participate in this program. 
Internships, Fellowships, & Co-Op Investment
MSA offers internships and fellowships in a variety of departments, such as EHS, Finance, Law, IT, Marketing, and Supply 
Chain. Our global teams provide meaningful work to ensure upcoming graduates have an educational and enjoyable 
experience.
In addition, we also offer multi-rotation co-ops in many engineering disciplines, including Chemical, Industrial, Mechanical, 
and Software. These rotations enable our co-ops to become engrained in our business, intimately learning our products 
and processes while forming strong relationships with their co-workers, and enabling a pipeline for future talent.
COMPENSATION, REWARDS AND BENEFITS
We understand that being recognized for a job well done
is important to all of us. Through use of the MSA 
Performance Lens, we strive to provide above-market
compensation opportunities for individuals who exceed
goals and expectations. We reward our associates in
various ways such as performance-based salary increases,
cash incentives and, in some cases, awards of MSA stock.
Also, we have a participation rate of more than 90 percent 
in our U.S. 401(k) retirement savings program. To support 
our associates with their retirement readiness goals, we 
made a significant enhancement to our 401(k) in 2020. 
For our U.S. associates who participate in theCompany’s 401(k) benefit plan, we increased our company
matching contribution to 100 percent on the first 5
percent that associates contribute.
Among other benefits, MSA has an expanded paid 
parental-leave policy, providing equal time-off benefits for 
both parents.
This holistic approach to Total Rewards aims to attract, 
retain, and motivate high-performing individuals who 
foster an innovative culture and generate exceptional 
results.

20
MSAFit is designed to help associates and spouses take 
an active role in managing their health. It offers associates 
a chance to learn their health risks, participate in health 
education, and earn financial incentives for participating 
in healthy activities.
Care & Development During COVID-19
MSA made several enhancements to our total rewards
benefits programs in 2020 to help our associates and their
dependents navigate COVID-19 and remain as healthy —
mentally, physically, and emotionally — as possible.
We also expanded our Employee Assistance Program
(EAP), previously available only in the U.S. and Canada,
to all associates around the globe. The EAP connects
associates and their dependents to a variety of
confidential and educational resources related to financial 
wellness, legal matters, referrals for childcare, legal 
services, and more.
 We also launched a Mental Health Awareness Campaign
to drive awareness of mental health issues and direct our 
associates to helpful resources.
Work-from-Home Tips
As many associates shifted to a remote working 
environment in 2020, we created a series of work-
from-home tips distributed to all associates via email 
throughout the year. These tips focused on best 
practices for maintaining balance while working from

Renewable Energy – In 2021, MSA will initiate the process 
of determining our global percentage of renewable 
energy mix with the expectation of setting future goals 
for increasing the percent renewable energy used across 
the organization.
EMISSIONS / CARBON FOOTPRINT
Total CO2e Emissions – Total 2020 global carbon dioxide 
equivalent emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) equaled 
18,286 metric tons across MSA’s global operations.
Scope 1 Emissions – Carbon dioxide equivalent emissions 
from fuel combustion totaled 4,345 metric tons across 
MSA’s global operations in 2020. Fuels included natural 
gas, liquid petroleum gas, and fuel oil, with comfort 
heating representing the primary use for these fuels.
Scope 2 Emissions – Global carbon dioxide equivalent 
emissions from purchased electricity totaled 13,941 metric 
tons across MSA’s global operations in 2020. Electric usage 
spans infrastructure and production operations. Scope 2 
emissions are calculated following the Greenhouse GasProtocol location-based methodology. Information is 
currently being collected to add GHG Protocol market-
based methodology to current data disclosure and analysis 
practices. In addition, to improve consistency, accuracy, 
and usability of data, MSA has employed improved Scope 
2 calculation methods by adopting standard methods for 
the selection of emission factors. Emission factor selection 
follows GHG Protocol recommendations, with 2020 
location-based emission calculations utilizing U.S. EPA 
eGrid data sets along with International Energy Agency 
data sets for non-U.S. locations. This standardization of 
emission factor data sets was applied to adjust 2019 Scope 
2 emissions data accordingly. Adjustment impacts can be 
reviewed in the chart on the next page.
Scope 3 Emissions – In 2021, MSA will begin the process 
of developing a Scope 3 emission inventory and baseline, 
beginning with transportation-related emissions. 
The inventory and baseline will be utilized to identify 
future opportunities to reduce Scope 3 impacts and set 
organizational reduction goals.

Developing Climate Risk Strategies
We’re working to create climate-resilient, sustainable 
operations, minimizing overall environmental risk 
and impact while maximizing operational excellence. 
Our climate strategy identifies and addresses possible 
disruptions to systems and assets caused by climate 
change and pinpoints opportunities for sustainable 
growth within MSA.
In 2020, MSA initiated steps to begin the development of 
a Climate Risk Management System, through which MSA 
will evaluate climate risk at an operations level through 
regional- and facility-specific assessments conducted on 
a routine basis. In addition, we have incorporated current 
and emerging regulation, technology, legal, market, 
reputation, acute, and chronic physical risk types into the 
climate risk management system assessment program 
extending to the organizational level. A future strategy 
will be developed through routine assessment, and the 
identification and evaluation of risk and opportunity will 
be identified as a part of the assessment program. 
 
 Product Stewardship 
A key element of our sustainability efforts is evaluating 
the environmental impacts our products can have on 
the world. Product stewardship starts with New Product 
Development. This process is a cross-functional effort that 
includes product design, sourcing, and manufacturing to 
help lessen the environmental impacts of our products. 
We strive to create products that keep our customers 
safe while minimizing impacts on our environment. As 
part of New Product Development, we are evaluating 
opportunities for improvement in areas such as: 
• Energy efficiency 
• Waste, in both product waste and packaging waste 
• Reuse, recycle, and remanufacture materials 
• Reduce harmful materials
Our current processes include maintaining compliance 
with REACH, RoHS, Prop 65, DOT, IATA, recycling, and 
disposal requirements for electronic equipment, among 
other things. 
For products already on the market, we use Value Analysis 
and Value Engineering (VA/VE) to find ways to reduce 
environmental impacts.
We’re working to create 
climate-resilient, 
sustainable operations, 
minimizing overall 
environmental risk and

SUPPLIER RESPONSIBILITY  
AND HUMAN RIGHTS
Supplier Responsibility
Our Supplier Code of Conduct (“Supplier Code”) sets forth 
our expectations for global supply chain partners for 
ethics and integrity, safety, human rights and labor laws, 
environmental practices, confidential information, and 
other practices.
We expect all suppliers to comply with our Supplier 
Code and to ensure these requirements are met within 
their supply chains. Additionally, MSA maintains a Global 
Supplier Handbook that outlines our expectations 
regarding quality management systems.
Supplier Assessments and Audits
We evaluate suppliers prior to selection. We complete 
due diligence to assess a supplier’s basic financial 
health, business structure, capabilities, and general level 
of quality. We also conduct supplier audits to ensure 
compliance with our requirements or improvement 
areas. We strive to help our suppliers improve their 
policies, processes, and practices through our supplier 
development team and remediation efforts. 
Supplier Diversity
Maintaining a diverse supplier base is beneficial for our 
business, supports our mission and values, and reinforces our commitment to our communities. MSA’s supplier 
diversity and inclusion mission is to proactively identify, 
build relationships with, and purchase goods and services 
from certified small businesses, as well as minority-, 
women-, veteran-, LGBT-, and disability-owned businesses.
Conflict Minerals 
MSA is committed to the responsible sourcing of tin, 
tantalum, tungsten, and gold (3TG), known as ‘conflict 
minerals. ’ Our Conflict Minerals Policy and Supplier Code 
set clear expectations for our suppliers to responsibly 
source these materials. Every year, MSA conducts a 
‘reasonable country of inquiry’ (RCOI) to determine 
whether any 3TGs used in our products originated in 
covered countries. We also conduct a supply chain survey 
with our direct suppliers using the Responsible Business 
Alliance® (RBA) and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative 
(“GeSI”) Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (“CMRT”). 
For reporting year 2020, 86% of MSA’s in-scope suppliers 
responded to the supply chain survey. For suppliers not 
meeting our established expectations, we also requested 
they submit an action plan with steps to remediate. More 
information on our conflict minerals process is publicly 
disclosed on our website and our Form SD.
Human Rights
One of our fundamental responsibilities is to respect 
and uphold human rights. Our publicly available Global 
Human Rights Policy is informed by various human 
rights principles, including the United Nations Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights. Our Human Rights Policy 
is complemented by our Modern Slavery and Human 
Trafficking Statement, Global Code of Business Conduct, 
Supplier Code of Conduct, and other policies. We expect 
our associates, suppliers, and other business partners to 
comply with our policies and conduct business in a way 
that respects and upholds human rights.
