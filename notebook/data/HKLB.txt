Focusing on the Future
2021 was a challenging year for Hongkong 
Land and for many of our stakeholders, as 
together we began to navigate a “new normal”. 
The evolving COVID-19 pandemic, along 
with global economic and social disruptions, 
brought into sharp focus the need for 
institutions, organisations and businesses 
to constantly evolve in order to meet the 
expectations of their stakeholders.
Over our more than 130 years of history, 
Hongkong Land has established a strong track 
record of delivering long-term value to our 
stakeholders and our communities. In 2021, 
we reaffirmed our commitment to adapt to an 
evolving sustainability landscape and rising 
investor expectations by introducing a number 
of important initiatives that better position the 
Group to deliver long-term results. 
Becoming a Sustainability Leader
During the past year, we have made important 
strides towards making our business and 
operations more sustainable, beginning with 
the development of our new Sustainability 
Framework 2030. Through this framework, we 
are aspiring to become a leader in sustainability 
by building on our heritage and creating 
long-term value for our stakeholders through 
spotlights and focus areas that are linked to 
measurable targets.
We conducted a comprehensive climate risk 
assessment on our commercial property 
portfolio, which considers two scenarios based ... we have made 
important strides 
towards making 
our business 
and operations 
more sustainable, 
beginning with the 
development of our 
new Sustainability 
Framework 2030. 
Chief Executive’s  
Message
on models developed by the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Both physical 
and transition risks were identified, and 
a preliminary adaptation action plan was 
disclosed in line with the recommendations 
of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD). The overall aim is to 
maintain the Group’s business resilience and 
readiness for potential climate-related risks. 
Hongkong Land has a long history of 
reinvesting in existing assets and has a robust 
green building certification programme. These

have allowed us to build our sustainability 
credentials while increasing operating 
efficiency. At the end of 2021, 93% of our 
commercial properties in operation by floor 
area, including those held in joint ventures, had 
achieved green building certification, with all 
of our buildings in Hong Kong and Singapore 
achieving the highest possible ratings: BEAM 
Plus Platinum and Green Mark Platinum 
certifications respectively.
Committing to Science-based T argets
As part of Hongkong Land’s commitment to 
accelerate our contributions to climate action, 
in February 2022, we announced a pledge 
to set science-based targets (SBTs) that are 
aligned with the 1.5°C pathway set out in the 
Paris Agreement. 
This bold commitment underlines the 
growing importance of climate resilience 
to our stakeholders and to the Group, and 
puts Hongkong Land at the forefront of the global transition to net-zero carbon by setting 
ambitious emissions reduction targets. Our 
commitment to SBTs provides the Group with 
a clearly defined roadmap for decarbonisation 
and represents an important milestone on 
the Group’s journey towards sustainable 
leadership.
Prioritising Sustainable Financing 
We also continued to integrate sustainability 
considerations into our treasury operations. In 
July 2021, we issued our inaugural, Hongkong 
Land issued our inaugural 10-year green 
bond, raising US$500 million to fund green 
buildings and related initiatives. By the end of 
2021, we also held a number of sustainability-
linked loans with an aggregate facility amount 
of US$1.9 billion. These facilities have tiered 
discounts on interest rates which are set 
against environmental and social targets – this 
incentivises us to demonstrate continuous 
improvements in energy efficiency, food waste 
reduction and renewable energy generation, 
whilst maintaining green building certifications 
for the Group’s Central Portfolio. 
Growing our HOME FUND
Established in 2020, our HOME FUND 
focuses on creating initiatives which benefit 
the younger generations and foster a more 
inclusive society. With an initial investment 
of HK$100 million in 2020, HOME FUND has 
already committed more than HK$50 million to 
various projects. The fund achieved a number 
of milestones during the year, including 
increasing the number of NGO partnerships 
from three to more than 60 across the region; establishing the HERE2HELP volunteering 
team which contributed over 850 volunteer 
hours in just six months; and the launch of 
a matching gift programme for tenants and 
employees in Hong Kong to support causes 
aligned with the fund’s vision. HOME FUND 
celebrated its first anniversary in November 
2021. 
The Group recognises that the global calls 
for climate action andprioritisation of 
environmental, social and governance (ESG)
performance are becoming increasingly 
urgent. As a real estate company with a 
regional presence, the Group is determined to 
continue engaging and collaborating with our 
stakeholders to push the sustainability agenda 
forward in the communities it serves.

Sustainability is the foundation upon which our 
purpose, vision and mission are built. In 2021, 
Hongkong Land adopted a new sustainability 
strategy, called “Sustainability Framework 2030” .  
The framework was developed by our 
Sustainability Committee, which will also 
oversee the implementation of the strategy and 
monitor our progress against the targets. The 
development process involved a combination 
of peer benchmarking and a thorough analysis 
of the 17 material aspects identified through 
engagement exercises conducted in 2019 
with stakeholders within Hongkong Land, 
and external stakeholders including tenants, 
suppliers, vendors, community representatives, 
NGOs, investors and business partners. 
Putting this framework into practice will require 
continuous evolution and improvements. 
While we expect to make some adjustments 
over time, in particular to the targets, our aim 
is to be guided by climate science and sector 
best practices as we further the integration of 
sustainability considerations into all levels of 
our business, providing long-term stability and 
value for our Group, our employees and the 
communities in which we operate.

About  
this ReportThis is Hongkong Land’s 12th annual 
sustainability report, covering the period from 
the 1st  January 2021 to the 31st December 2021. 
The theme of this report is “inspire : aspire
Towards Sustainable Leadership”. Hongkong 
Land is a future-focused company. We aim to 
amass the infrastructure, talent, technology, and 
connections necessary to create a sustainable 
tomorrow for the Group and the communities 
we work within. By doing so, we aspire to 
become a sustainability leader in Asia.  
 
In this report, we focus on Hongkong Land’s 
new Sustainability Framework 2030, our 
sustainability policies and plans, key initiatives, 
performance highlights and case studies 
throughout the year. This report also presents 
performance data covering leasing portfolios 
and development projects the Group holds 
through subsidiaries and joint ventures, where 
the Group has management control. 
An overview of Hongkong Land’s organisational 
structure and financial performance are 
included in the consolidated financial 
statements provided in our Annual Report.  
No significant changes to Hongkong Land’s 
organisational structure or supply chain took 
place during the reporting year. 
This report was prepared in accordance with the 
Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) Standards: 
Core option and the recommendations of 
the TCFD. We also applied the GRI reporting 
principles of stakeholder inclusiveness, 
sustainability context, materiality, and completeness to define the report content; 
and the principles of accuracy, balance, clarity, 
comparability, reliability, and timeliness to 
ensure the quality of this report. 
The topics covered in this report were selected 
according to the results of a materiality 
assessment conducted in 2019, which identified 
and prioritised the material topics of Hongkong 
Land in consultation with different stakeholder 
groups. More information about these groups 
and the consultation process can be found in 
the Stakeholder Engagement section of this 
report.
While the material topics are the same as 
our recent sustainability reports, they are 
addressed in a new way this year through 
our new sustainability strategy, Sustainability 
Framework 2030, which emphasises climate 
adaptation and sustainable growth through 
science-based emissions reduction targets, 
and deepens our commitment to creating 
sustainable, long-term value. 
The report was independently verified by a third 
party, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), which 
provides limited assurance. The assurance 
statement can be found on page 149-150. 
As part of our ongoing efforts to improve our 
sustainability performance and reporting, 
we invite you to forward any comments or 
questions to our Sustainability Committee at

Materiality Matrix
The following materiality matrix was developed from a materiality assessment conducted in 2019 by the Hongkong Land Sustainability Committee in conjunction with 
different stakeholder groups. After identifying potential material topics based on a review of industry peers, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 
other research, stakeholders were engaged through a broadly-distributed online survey, sent to 1,300 stakeholders and receiving a response rate of 35%. The workshops were 
conducted with department heads and Sustainability Committee members, and face-to-face interviews with senior management.  
The material topics were determined according to GRI Standards as those that reflect the most significant economic, environmental and social impacts of our business, or those 
that substantively influence the assessments and decisions of stakeholders.

The health of the environment is indispensable 
to our business operations. The Climate 
and Economic Resilience strategic spotlight is 
an umbrella covering a number of important 
topics chiefly related to the environment and the 
economic performance of Hongkong Land. 
Our Environmental Working Group (EWG), 
consisting of members from different 
departments, is responsible for overseeing 
all environmental issues, leading the climate 
risk assessment process and implementing 
mitigation measures. The status and 
effectiveness of our climate resilience measures 
are reviewed during the quarterly EWG meetings.19
Hongkong Land has always taken a long-term view 
of community building and value generation. As 
we focus on the future, it is clear to us that climate 
change will become an urgent topic at all levels 
of society and across all industries. Consumers, 
businesses and governments are beginning to 
pivot towards climate-oriented decision making; 
a development that will only accelerate in the 
coming years. 
Our approach to addressing climate 
change involves integrating climate 
risk mitigation measures into our 
strategic planning and activities 
across our operations. Climate 
risk assessment has now been 
incorporated into our corporate risk 
management structure. We believe 
this is an essential component of 
future proofing our business, as well as an essential part of doing 
business in general. In each of the 
jurisdictions where we operate, we 
strive to not only comply with all 
environmental laws and regulations 
but to exceed these requirements 
and adopt best practices in order to 
both mitigate our impacts and build 
climate resilience.Climate

Successfully Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Hongkong Land seeks to establish ourselves as an industry leader in mitigating climate change. We will accomplish this 
by working to aggressively reduce GHG emissions across our properties. To achieve our emissions-related 2030 targets, 
in 2021, we focused on retrofitting existing assets, sourcing more renewable energy, consuming energy efficiently and 
reducing the emissions footprint of our buildings and the materials we source and utilise. 
In 2019, we achieved our target of reducing the carbon footprint of our Central Portfolio by 30% against a baseline of 2008. 
In 2021, this figure rose to 40%, meaning we are on track to our 2030 target of a 55% reduction.New Science-based T argets Submitted to 
Align Decarbonisation Objectives
In February 2022, we committed to reducing 
our emissions by setting net-zero targets in line 
with climate science and that are consistent with 
the Paris Agreement which aims to limit global 
warming to 1.5°C. 
While these targets remain subject to validation 
by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi); 
Hongkong Land has committed to a 46% 
reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions and a 
22% reduction in carbon intensity for Scope 
3 emissions by 2030 from 2019 levels for our 
operations across Asia.

Reducing Energy Consumption Across 
Our Leasing Portfolio
To achieve these targets, we are committed to 
continuously reducing electricity consumption 
across our portfolio. 
Driving these actions are our Sustainability, 
Environmental and Climate Change Action 
policies. We manage our energy performance 
centrally via our Centralised Monitoring 
Centre which provides regular monitoring and 
performance reporting. In addition, we have also 
adopted ISO 14001 environmental management 
standards which cover energy management 
through setting targets, implementing energy-
saving initiatives, monitoring results and 
identifying improvement opportunities.
These measures have achieved cumulative 
success: Between 2008 and 2021, Hongkong 
Land’s Central Portfolio reduced total electricity consumption by 300 million kWh, equivalent  
to an annual reduction in operating costs of 
US$4 million.
In 2021 we upgraded our Central Portfolio 
operating system which included:
 High efficiency EC plug fan replacement for 
all air handling units (AHUs) and pre-cooled 
air conditioning units (PAUs).
 A lift modernisation including high-efficiency 
motors and regenerative brake system.
 An AI-based chiller optimisation programme 
for several buildings in the portfolio. 
 Automatic fault/energy inefficiency 
diagnostics for all buildings in the portfolio.
 Replacement of chiller plants in 
Jardine House and LANDMARK with 
new high-efficiency chillers with more environmentally-friendly R514A refrigerant.
 The piloting of “ComfyApp” to one-third 
of office tenants in the portfolio – this is a 
personalised indoor comfort application for 
tenants. Results show a 2.5% savings in air 
conditioning electricity consumption and a 
60% reduction in service calls.
 Free replacement of T8 fluorescent tubes 
with high-efficiency LED tubes for all tenants.
 Installation of an IoT sensor network with an 
analytics platform.
 Installation of more PV panels throughout 
the portfolio.

In Singapore, at One Raffles Link, we replaced chiller units, upgraded 
AHUs with EC fans, and installed UVC lights and new IAQ sensors, 
significantly improving airside efficiency. We also commenced the 
conversion of the primary and secondary loop chilled water system to a 
single loop system. At One Raffles Quay, we continued with the EC fan 
replacement work for all AHUs. Work is scheduled to be completed in 2022.In Indonesia, the WTC team in Jakarta continued their energy saving 
initiatives, managing to save 100 million rupiah per month from July 2021 
onward by installing new chilled water pipes that share one night load 
chiller and shortening AHU operation hours on Saturdays. Meanwhile, 
Arumaya Residences upgraded to 100% LED lighting for apartment 
units, typical common corridors and common areas including basement 
carparks. This will reduce annual energy consumption by 51%. We also 
used inverters for air conditioners, resulting in a 58% reduction in energy 
consumption.  Singapore  IndonesiaClimate

Generating Electricity from Renewable Sources
We are actively installing more PV panels 
on other rooftops in our Central Portfolio, 
including a pilot of new-generation panels on 
the roof of Gloucester Tower, which use bi-
facial technology. As compared to conventional 
monocrystalline single-face panels, this new 
technology has an additional thin-film layer on 
its rear side which absorbs solar reflection off 
the roof’s surface below the panel to provide 
additional power generation. The second face 
can produce approximately 15W/m2, in addition 
to the top-facing surface which has an efficient 
wattage of 201W/m2. This bi-facial technology 
may produce a solar energy conversion factor 
30,097 kWh
T otal electricity generated by panels  
in our Central Portfolio in 2021as high as 20.21%. The pilot scheme is expected 
to be completed in Q3 of 2022.
Hongkong Land is also committed to increasing 
our renewable energy capabilities properties 
across the region. In 2021, we installed 792m2 
of PV panels at The Ring, Chongqing. Between 
August 2021 and the end of the year, these 
panels generated 38,000kWh of electricity. 
Meanwhile, at Dream Land in Wuhan, we 
installed 640m2 of PV panels on the roofs of 
residential buildings in late 2020. Between 
December 2020 and 31st December 2021, these 
panels generated 65,000kWh of electricity.

both to meet our electricity needs and support the 
Feed-In Tariff scheme initiated by the Hong Kong 
government and Hongkong Electric. Since 2011, 
we have installed 547 solar PV panels throughout 
our Hong Kong portfolio with a cumulative 
power capacity of over 95,000W on the rooftops 
of Chater House, The Forum, Prince’s Building, 
Alexandra House, Edinburgh Tower, and One, Two 
and Three Exchange Square. The total electricity 
generated by panels in our Central Portfolio in 
2021 was 30,097kWh. We anticipate much higher 
power generation in 2022, as the majority of these

Central Portfolio Property Management 
T eam Won CIBSE Award
Hongkong Land won this prestigious award 
primarily due to the implementation of 
innovative technologies across the buildings 
of our Central Portfolio that produced energy 
efficiencies and reduced overall energy 
consumption. 
Through the portfolio’s Smart Green Facility 
Operations programme, we have reduced 
reliance on manual labour, instead using 
artificial intelligence, machine learning, digital 
twins, intelligent security systems, video 
analytics, cloud-based controls, and big data 
analytics to perform analyses and obtain useful 
insights from operational and user data.
Savings were generated by data analytics 
that identified inefficient operations, by AI-
optimised chiller operations that helped us 
strategically enhance air-side and water-side 
equipment, and an energy management 
system for air conditioning that was jointly 
developed with an air conditioning system 
maintenance contractor. This collaboration has enhanced the usefulness and accuracy of our 
energy management system: an AI algorithm 
allows the contractor to rapidly identify faults 
and energy inefficiencies, effecting quick 
repairs and providing useful insights for 
continuous improvements of the system.

Climate-related Financial Disclosures
Referencing recommendations from the 
TCFD, Hongkong Land is taking steps to better 
position ourselves to manage climate-related 
risks and capture opportunities for sustainable 
development. Our new sustainability strategy, 
Sustainability Framework 2030, integrates 
climate risk mitigation measures into our 
strategic planning and activities across our 
operations in order to future proof our business 
and properties. A summary of the key insights 
including key points from our Adaptation 
Action Plan may be found below. 
                    
The Board oversees Hongkong Land’s risk 
management framework, including all 
climate-related risks. Environmental, social 
and governance updates are reported on 
and discussed at quarterly board meetings. 
We conduct regular risk identification and 
analysis and review management processes 
through the Audit Committee. Climate change 
has been included as an emerging risk in our 
risk management system which is reviewed 
and analysed on a bi-annual basis by our Risk 
Management Committee, chaired by our Chief 
Executive.
The Group’s executive management team 
has overall operational accountability for 
sustainability performance. Furthermore, all 
matters relating to sustainability, including 
climate-related issues, are overseen by our Sustainability Committee, which meets every 
six months, with our Chief Executive as 
Chairman, Chief Financial Officer and executive 
directors representing our Group activities. The 
EWG reports to the Sustainability Committee. 
Through the EWG, we plan and implement 
mitigation measures and to facilitate the 
integration of climate-related issues into 
business operations.
Sustainability Framework 2030 integrates 
sustainability in all aspects of our decision 
making and operations, and will include key 
performance indicators. Our performance 
against these targets will be reviewed and 
disclosed in our annual sustainability reports, 
which in turn are reviewed and commented 
upon by Sustainability Committee members. 
Both the Board and the Sustainability 
Committee have sufficient knowledge of 
climate-related issues and the impacts of such 
issues on the Group’s business and operations.
Our Sustainability Framework 2030 is in line 
with key pillars of our business and our material 
topics. Actionable items and targets concentrate 
our efforts on providing long-term value to 
stakeholders through strengthened climate 
adaptation and resilience measures across our 
operations. Climate risk assessments are now 
included in our corporate risk management 
system, with 2090 being the long-term time horizon and 2030 being the short-term horizon. 
The time horizons are commonly used in the 
real estate sector and it covers the range of 
anticipated design life of various building 
components. Corresponding climate mitigation 
measures are being implemented for properties 
in operation and new developments. 
While our strategic guidelines are set at the 
Group level, these guidelines incorporate 
region-specific climate information so as to 
tailor our approach to different operations. 
The regions covered in our portfolio-wide 
climate risk assessment include: Hong Kong, 
Beijing, Shanghai, Macau, Thailand, Singapore, 
Cambodia and Indonesia.

To better understand our climate-related 
risks, we conducted a climate risk analysis 
to assess how climate change might impact 
our properties. The assessment identifies 
physical and transition risks and enables us 
to formulate strategies and mitigation plans 
to address these risks. In line with the TCFD 
recommendations, two different scenarios 
were selected for Hongkong Land to identify 
physical risks as distinct from transition 
risks and opportunities. A high emissions 
warning scenario called “RCP8.5” was 
selected as the most appropriate scenario 
for identifying physical risks, whilst a lower 
emissions warning scenario aiming to limit 
the increase in global mean temperature 
to 2°C called “RCP2.6” was selected as the 
most appropriate scenario for identifying 
transition risks and opportunities. Our 
climate risk consultant proposed these RCPs 
because these scenarios represent the best 
and worst cases in relation to curbing and 
minimising GHG emissions, taking account 
of the present situation. 
Hongkong Land is now in the process of 
implementing mitigation measures to 
address these risks across our investment 
portfolio. The climate risk assessment has

highest or above ratings for other leasing assets. Our approach is to design, 
build and renovate properties according to standards set out in green 
building certification schemes.
Whilst the certification of new developments across the region have 
become more prevalent due to government incentives, similar measures to 
support the retrofitting of existing buildings remain less common. Reducing 
the environmental impact of existing buildings is critical to meaningful 
global decarbonisation , as a vast majority of these buildings will remain 
operational well into the 2030s and 2040s. The Group has a long history 
of reinvesting in existing assets and undertaking a robust green building 
certification programme , which emphasises both fixed asset investments
and deployment of technological solutions to drive energy and resource 
efficiency.
Environmental impact assessments are carried out for designated new 
projects to preserve the environment during the planning, design and 
construction period. Common elements adopted for the Group’s projects 
include PV panels, smart dynamic LED lighting, green walls, reused stone, 
and wooden decking with a high recycled wood content.
At the end of 2021, 93% of our commercial properties in operation 
by floor area, including those held in joint ventures, achieved green 
building certification.
Supporting Green Building Initiatives
Hongkong Land was a proud supporter of Hong Kong Green 
Building Week 2021, held in late September and organised by the 
Construction Industry Council (CIC) and the Hong Kong Green Building 
Council (HKGBC). This year’s campaign, “Embrace Green Building – 
Decarbonise in One Step”, aimed to promote the importance of building 
decarbonisation and adopting a low-carbon lifestyle. The week allowed us 
to promote the importance of green buildings and Biz-Green Dress to our 
staff and other stakeholders.New Green Building Certifications in 2021

A refresh of Alexandra House in 2020-2021 saw us transform 
the third floor from a typical office floor to a restaurant floor, 
extending the original shopping arcade and creating two 
new F&B spaces. 
We used a new generation sustainable timber deck, made 
of 95% recycled materials and specially treated to be 
stain resistant. The deck has minimal drainage gaps and 
a proprietary method for fixing the deck planks where no 
screws are required, facilitating quick installation, easy 
maintenance and future replacement. We also enhanced 
the alfresco dining experience by adding natural green 
walls composed of real plants with a built-in self-irrigation 
and drainage system which requires minimal manual 
maintenance.

Managing resources efficiently and effectively is 
an important part of Sustainability Framework 
2030. Proper resource management reduces 
expenditures and impacts on the climate. We 
have thus retrofitted existing buildings across 
our portfolio with a variety of technologies and 
features to improve resource efficiency, while also 
investigating and seizing on new opportunities 
that minimise our use of natural resources.
For example, water-saving systems 
with leak detection and automatic 
cut-off features have been installed 
to better manage our water 
consumption. To reduce material 
consumption and improve waste 
management, we employ such 
practices as reusing materials 
during renovations, encouraging new tenants to retain the fit out of 
previous tenants and introducing 
recycling programmes for various 
recyclables. We also reduce waste 
within our own operations through 
paper-less office initiatives, opting 
for e-procurement, e-tendering and 
e-document platforms. Resource

Examples of our commitment to 
recycling in the Central Portfolio include:
 Recycling paper, aluminium cans, plastic 
bottles, rechargeable batteries, fluorescent 
tubes, glass bottles, waste from electrical 
and electronic equipment (WEEE), and 
Chinese New Year (CNY) trees.
 Growing our commitment to food waste 
recycling with food waste composters in all 
buildings in the Central Portfolio, each with 
a daily handling capacity of 2,250kg.
 Offering only compostable food packaging 
at our F&B outlets and installing 
complimentary still and sparkling water 
fountains to avoid single-use water bottles.Redistributing  
Leftover Food
Hongkong Land worked with the government’s 
Social Innovation and Entrepreneurship 
Development Fund and St. James’ Settlement 
who jointly developed a digital platform called 
“Food-Co” which enables the distribution 
of leftover food to at-risk communities. All 
F&B operators at BaseHall in Jardine House 
agreed to take part in this initiative, which 
has created a significant ecosystem to donate 
leftover food that would otherwise be wasted. 
Between March and August 2021, the campaign 
collected 87kg of food which benefitted 88 
people.Improving the Way We Manage Waste
In our Environmental Policy, we state that Hongkong 
Land is committed to making the most efficient use of 
the resources and materials we consume, reducing waste 
generation and safely and responsibly disposing of any 
residual waste. Our approach to waste management 
includes adopting circularity principles and preventing 
and minimising waste generation by seeking ways to 
recycle materials during construction, operation and 
demolition, then making use of these resources again 
after they are treated or processed – for example by 
adopting materials with recycled content during the 
design and construction and even site formation process 
of a building project. We have also enhanced recycling 
and the use of sustainable materials to ensure that we 
use natural resources as efficiently as possible.

Construction Waste Management
Hongkong Land is committed reducing our 
construction waste footprint throughout our 
development portfolio, particularly through the 
use of BIM technology in our projects in Hong 
Kong and Thailand. In 2021, we undertook 
several measures: 
 100% of car stoppers in parking spaces 
were made using recycled concrete, thus 
reducing concrete waste.
 100% of rebar for beams and columns was 
pre-cut in an offsite factory, meaning there 
was no waste generated on site.
 100% of the structural steel I-beams were 
prefabricated in an offsite factory, meaning 
there was no waste generated on site.
 Used pre-fabricated wall panels instead of 
brickwork to reduce dust and waste. This 
also shortened the construction timeline.
 Used the BIM model to plan and map out 
the construction process to reduce mistakes 
and redo various elements. This helped 
reduce material waste, for example in the 
piping and conduit installation routes. Arumaya, Indonesia 
 Wireless Road Project, ThailandGreen Property Management System 
The new Property Management System went live in 2021. This digital 
system enables internal HKL teams to collaborate with tenants and
vendors using a single system, saving time and reducing paper waste.
The vendor management side of the system provides a fully digitised 
tender management module and workspaces that support project 
management. In the 12 months since the system launched, over 
535 tenders were awarded, saving many hours of input over the old 
manual system. Meanwhile the tenant management side digitises 
tenancy records – creating a single record that exists independent of 
expansions, contractions or inter-building moves – and allows self-
service and management of tenant emergency contacts and initiation 
of fit-out projects. The new system has already enabled much more 
efficient communication between HKL and its tenants and vendors.
In 2021, offices in our Chinese mainland portfolio used this system to 
shift online, providing electronic documentation and an e-signature 
system. This resulted in a significant decrease in paper use, with 
annual paper consumption decreasing by more than 2,000kg.
In our Central Portfolio, the system provided e-procurement, 
e-tendering and e-tenant services, creating a near-paperless operation.

Conserving Water Across  
our Properties
Hongkong Land’s approach to 
reducing our water footprint mainly 
involves installing and utilising water-
saving features in our investment 
portfolio such as low-flow taps and 
toilets. 
In 2021 we installed water
efficient fixtures in our Central
Portfolio to reduce water 
consumption, began reusing 
seawater for air-conditioning systems 
and toilet flushing, and installed 
leak detection and automatic cut-off 
systems to minimise water wastage.
We are also designing and building 
water-gathering features into our 
development properties, particularly 
in southeast Asia, which see high 
levels of rainfall. Examples of these 
initiatives include:
Asya,  
Indonesia
All waste water is 
processed in the 
communal sewerage 
treatment plant and 
the processed water 
is used for watering 
plants.
Each house and 
shared facilities 
are equipped with 
absorption wells to 
help reduce water 
run-off.

Sustainable Construction and 
Environmental Practices
At our construction projects, all efforts are 
made to ensure that no adverse impacts 
occur which affect the environment, workers 
or the surrounding community during the 
project. We conduct responsible site selection: 
In compliance with legal requirements, we 
conduct environmental impact assessments 
before we proceed with development in the 
approved and designated area.
Sustainable construction practices across our 
portfolio include:
 Separating metal waste from other on-site 
waste, which is then sold by the contractor 
to recycling companies (Asya, Nava Park 
and Arumaya in Indonesia).
 Reinforcement bars and cement sourced 
from suppliers near the site, reducing 
delivery fuel consumption (The Velaris, 
Philippines). 
 Scrap reinforcement bars and waste 
concrete used for temporary construction 
parking, driveways, car stoppers, curbs and 
islands (The Velaris, Philippines).  Products such as architectural finishes, 
appliances and lighting fixtures in The 
Velaris are certified by BERDE, the Building 
for Ecologically Responsive Design 
Excellence – a national green building rating 
scheme in the Philippines.
 Adopting other green materials like nano 
waterproofing and TiO2 ceramic tiles.
 Separating plastic wastes then donated to 
a recycling company to produce alternative 
construction materials such as Eco planks 
and boards; and other furniture products 
such as table and bench.

Sustainable  
Finance
Hongkong Land believes that sustainable 
financing methods – green loans, green bonds 
and sustainability-linked loans – will form an 
increasingly larger part of our financing picture in 
the years to come. Solidifying this belief, in July 
2021, we established the Hongkong Land Green 
Financing Framework (the GFF).
The GFF demonstrates how, using 
green financing transactions (GFTs), 
the Group can fund projects that 
deliver positive environmental 
impacts and foster sustainable 
practices in support of our 
Sustainability Framework 2030. 
These GFTs include bonds,

In 2020, Hongkong Land reached agreements 
with several banks in Hong Kong to secure 
sustainability-linked revolving credit facilities 
totalling HK$4.4 billion.
These loan agreements are linked to our ESG 
performance. Targets include reductions in 
GHG emissions, electricity consumption and 
food waste, as well as increases in solar energy 
generation, whilst maintaining green building 
certifications for the Group’s Central Portfolio.In 2021, our green finance efforts gathered 
pace, with the issuance of our first US$500 
million 10-year green bonds in July 2021 
followed by a HK$375 million 10 year green 
bond in August 2021. The Group also has 
sustainability-linked credit facilities signed 
with lenders in Hong Kong, Singapore and 
Thailand. At the end of 2021, the Group had 
aggregate sustainability-linked credit facilities 
of US$1.9 billion.The Group’s subsidiary MCL Land and City 
Developments Limited (CDL) jointly secured 
green loans of S$847 million to finance 
the development of two residential sites in

2021 Sustainability Forums 
Two forums were held during the year for 
tenants of our Central Portfolio, in January 
and December 2021. We invited senior tenant 
representatives, and our own Chief Executive,  
Chief Financial Officer, Executive Directors and 
other high-level managers.
The aims were to:
 Share Hongkong Land’s sustainability

tenants
 Invite tenants to share their sustainability 
measures, targets and performance results
 Encourage tenants to communicate and learn 
from each other’s experience
 Identify landlord-tenant collaboration 
opportunities
 Solicit feedback and suggestions from tenants 
to help identify new sustainability initiatives
The first forum, titled “Collaboration for a 
More Sustainable Future” , was hosted online 
with guest speakers from financial institutions, 
accounting firms and environmental consulting 
firms to showcase examples of effective green 
design and finance.
The second forum, titled “Building a Better 
and Greener Community” , was hosted in hybrid mode with guest speakers that included 
Professor Christine Loh from the Hong Kong 
University of Science and Technology, who 
spoke about “Post COP26 – Accelerating 
Towards Net Zero”; and Mr Jonathan Drew 
from HSBC who discussed “Financing the

 At our Hong Kong, Beijing, 
and Singapore operations, we 
have implemented a screening 
and assessment programme. 
Vendors must provide evidence 
of environmental certifications 
and policies during the 
tendering process for review 
and consideration. During the 
vendor application process, one 
of the entry requirements is 
that new vendors hold both ISO 
14001 and ISO 45001 certification 
to demonstrate that they have 
environmental management 
systems in place, as well as OHSAS 
18001 Occupational Health and Safety certification. At the end of 
2021, we spent 52% of our annual 
spending on both ISO certified 
contractors or vendors. We target 
having this figure at 100% by the 
end of 2030.Supply Chain  
Management
Hongkong Land’s supply chain comprises a variety 
of suppliers and contractors providing goods and 
services to support our offices and our property design, 
construction and management services. T o ensure our
vendors share the same commitment to sustainability, 
our management approach is to assess their 
environmental and social qualifications during the 
appointment process. As set out in our Supplier Code 
of Conduct, Hongkong Land is committed to doing 
everything we can to minimise, control and reduce our 
impact on the environment and be a positive influence 
in the communities in which we operate.

Aside from ISO certification, we have our 
own internal green specifications, which are 
reviewed and adjusted both on a continuous 
basis and when we upgrade equipment or 
facilities. There are also vendor health and 
safety requirements, discussed further in the 
Occupational Health and Safety section. These 
specifications ensure our chosen vendors
align with our ESG requirements. We also 
believe that spending is the best metric to measure how our green procurement is 
progressing, rather than the proportion of total 
vendors. We are in the process of reviewing 
our core vendors’ environmental and social 
credentials and have set out a phased roadmap 
for upscaling these.
Existing vendors are periodically evaluated on 
a wide range of criteria, including sustainability, 
as set out in our vendor management policy. 
During the vendor evaluation process, any cases 
of non-compliance are reported and handled 
in accordance with our incident management 
procedures. All incidents are recorded and 
tracked for follow up and correction. Regular 
vendor performance evaluations are carried 
out, with a portion of the score based on

In July and August 2021, we conducted four

our sustainable procurement and vendor

reinforced that partnering with our suppliers 
is critical to our sustainability success. We also 
emphasised that the deadline for our Tier-1 
vendors to acquire or possess valid environment 
(ISO 14001) and occupation health and safety 
(ISO 45001) certifications is the end of 2022.
We also initiated a Supplier Code of Conduct 
survey with our core suppliers to enhance our 
understanding of socially-related aspects of 
sustainable procurement. The survey aimed 
to shed light on such elements as workforce 
composition, hiring and termination practices, 
wages, working hours, health and safety, and 
others. Oversight of these will allow us to see potential improvement areas and raise the ESG 
standard of our vendor pool in general. 
The survey was sent to 70 Tier-1 and Tier-2 
vendors and obtained a 90% response rate. 
We found that over 70% of our core vendors 
have dedicated staff for environmental, safety, 
human resources practices, and compliance. 
We followed up with non-compliant core 
vendors with requests to improve their 
standards.
The next steps will include reinforcing good 
practices with our core vendors and sharing

Improving Indoor Air Quality in Central
Indoor air quality is an important component of 
tenant health and wellness. This was particularly 
significant during the COVID-19 pandemic, as 
maintaining good air quality is key to preventing 
the spread of airborne diseases as well as a tangible 
measure of our overall sustainability practices. 
Improving indoor air quality is also an important 
target for Hongkong Land, and as such we are 
committed to ensuring clean air within all our 
properties to create healthier and more appealing 
environments for our tenants, customers, staff and 
visitors.
In 2021, all buildings in our Central Portfolio attained 
either a “Good Class” or “Excellent Class” rating 
under the Hong Kong SAR Indoor Air Quality 
Certification Scheme. We achieved this by:
 Maintaining a sufficient fresh air supply in all 
areas of all buildings;
 Using high-performance filters to reduce 
airborne particulates;
 Carrying out systematic inspections and 
maintenance on all air-conditioning and 
ventilation systems, including regular cleaning of 
air filters and ducts;
 Placing rigorous controls on all levels of indoor

The Operational Excellence strategic

Hongkong Land has developed inclusive 
human resources practices for talent attraction, 
retention and development; diversity and 
inclusion; employee engagement and wellness 
programmes. We also conduct regular 
meetings with the wider Group and across 
regions to perform periodic reviews and ensure 
compliance with implemented internal controls 
and approval policies and procedures. 74

Corporate Governance 
Hongkong Land understands the 
importance of good corporate governance 
to long-term success. The Group’s current 
governance system has developed and 
evolved over many years, and is tailored 
to the Group’s size, ownership structure, 
complexity, and breadth of business. 
The Group thus benefits from Jardine 
Matheson’s strategic guidance and 
professional expertise, while also having 
a respected, independent Board and clear 
operational accountability that rests with 
the executive management team. The 
Group undertakes periodic reviews of its 
corporate governance practices to ensure 
this balance is maintained. 
Hongkong Land executive management 
team has clear operational accountability 
for sustainability performance, which is 
reflected in annual appraisals and impacts 
variable remuneration payments. 
Our Sustainability Committee reports 
to the Hongkong Land Board and is 
chaired by our Chief Executive. The 
Committee oversees all matters relating 
to sustainability and is responsible for 
managing the Group’s sustainability 
policies and strategies including targets, 
key initiatives, sustainability reporting, 
associated risks and opportunities, and 
other matters of significance. 
PwC undertook an assurance engagement 
with respect to selected sustainability 
information provided by Hongkong Land. 
They verified sustainability performance data relating to environmental, social and 
community measures and presented 
an Independent Practitioner’s Limited 
Assurance Report to the Board of Directors 
of Hongkong Land Holdings Limited. 
As part of our ongoing efforts to improve 
our sustainability performance and 
reporting, the Board of Directors oversees 
the long-term strategic direction of 
the Group and approves key business 
priorities for the Sustainability Committee. 
We also periodically test and audit the 
Group’s Business Continuity Plans. 
We take our responsibilities as a good 
corporate citizen seriously. As property 
developers and managers, we recognise 
that we play an important role in the local 
community. With our strong internal 
corporate governance practices and 
ethical standards, we integrate economic, 
social and environmental considerations 
into all levels of our business decision-
making processes. In turn, this helps us 
consider and provide for the needs of the 
community. 
Our comprehensive codes and policies 
guide our business practices to ensure 
that our operations and corporate culture 
align with our sustainability commitments. 
We constantly review and update the 
policies and practices to ensure that all 
our commitments are consistently and 
continuously adhered to across our 
operations and in our interactions with 
business partners, suppliers and other 
stakeholders.Climate And

Risk Management
Hongkong Land adopts a robust approach 
to managing risks. This is supported by our 
corporate governance structure, our internal 
policies and procedures, and our various 
management systems – all of which enable us 
to identify and mitigate risks to our operations 
and reputation. Our approach to addressing 
environmental, health and safety, business 
continuity, and climate risks is outlined in our 
corporate risk management framework, which is 
overseen by our Risk Management Committee 
and the Audit Committee. Our approach to 
addressing key risks is highlighted below.
Ensuring Business Continuity 
Our Business Continuity Management (BCM) 
framework enables us to mitigate and minimise 
the impact of any disruption to our operations 
through a coordinated response, ensuring 
a quick recovery and continuation of critical 
business functions. This includes fire, natural 
disaster and pandemics. Updated in 2019, the 
BCM was put into practice throughout the 
COVID-19 outbreak, when staff were required 
to work from home or in split teams as the 
situation warranted. The BCM framework is 
overseen by our Risk Management Committee 
which is chaired by the Chief Executive and 
is comprised of executive directors of each 
business function. The Committee meets at least 
twice a year to discuss and update corporate 
management subjects, including BCM.
Climate Risks
The global environmental, social and financial 
implications of climate change are becoming increasingly evident and can no longer be 
ignored. As the world strives to limit global 
warming to below 1.5°C compared to pre-
industrial levels, in accordance with the Paris 
Agreement, Hongkong Land is doing our part. 
Our property development and management 
operations are working to reduce GHG 
emissions and invest in innovations, including 
resource efficient and climate-resilient buildings 
in support of carbon neutrality commitments 
being made by governments globally. For more 
details on our approach to managing climate 
risks, including the findings of our Climate 
Risk Assessment and our response to the 
recommendations from the TCFD, please see the 
Climate Change section of this report. 
Environmental, Occupational  
Health and Safety Risks
To help us better identify and focus our resources 
to mitigate environmental and occupational 
health and safety risks, we have implemented 
integrated management systems, ISO 14001 
and 45001, in our operations in Hong Kong, 
Singapore and the Chinese mainland. Currently, 
56% of our properties are certified to the relevant 
standards. These systems give us an enhanced 
understanding of potential issues and place a 
stronger emphasis on top management to actively 
engage and take accountability for potential 
risks and opportunities. Extended requirements 
for consultation with workers and worker 
participation are also included in these standards.  
Cybersecurity Risks
The Group’s businesses are ever more 
reliant on technology in their operations and face increasing numbers of cyberattacks 
from groups targeting both individuals and 
businesses. As a result, the privacy and security 
of customer, tenant and corporate information 
are at risk of being compromised through a 
breach of our own or our suppliers’ IT systems 
or the unauthorised or accidental release 
of information, resulting in brand damage, 
impaired competitiveness or regulatory action. 
Cyberattacks may also adversely affect our 
ability to manage our business operations or 
operate information technology and business 
systems, resulting in business interruption, lost 
revenues, repair or other costs.
Hongkong Land mitigates cybersecurity risks in 
several ways: By engaging external consultants 
to perform assessments on business units 
using industry benchmarks; by defining a 
cybersecurity programme with a centralised 
team that provides oversight, manages 
cybersecurity matters, and continuously works 
to strengthen cyber defences and security 
measures; by performing regular vulnerability 
assessments and penetration testing to identify 
weaknesses; by maintaining disaster recovery 
plans and backups for data restoration; and by 
arranging regular security awareness training 
at least annually and phishing testing to raise 
cybersecurity awareness.
These are set out in detail in our Information 
Security Policy, which provides guiding 
principles for the best practice of information 
security management that protects the Group 
against potential threats and vulnerabilities.Further

T alent Recruitment 
Hongkong Land’s policies and guidelines, 
including our Code of Conduct, Diversity and 
Equal Opportunity Policy and Human Rights 
Policy, outline our expectations for fair and 
transparent recruitment processes, our appraisal 
system, appropriate recognition, and competitive 
remuneration and benefits packages.
They also reflect our commitment to 
providing equal opportunities in all aspects 
of employment as well as respectful 
collaboration, teamwork with diverse 
representation, work-life balance, flexible 
working conditions, and freedom of 
association. As set out in our Diversity and 
Inclusion and Equal Opportunity policies, 
we strictly prohibit discrimination and non-
meritocratic preferences of any kind in our 
recruitment practices and adhere strictly to 
competency requirements for the job. We are 
also committed to limiting temporary and non-
regular employment.
In addition to standard marriage, maternity 
and paternity leave, Hongkong Land also offers 
special adoption leave, for parents who have 
recently adopted a child; and volunteer leave, 
given to volunteers who have participated 
in Hongkong Land-sponsored community 
programmes.Chinese mainland Graduate  
Recruitment Programme 
We focus on the future to ensure we have the 
competence and capacity to deliver on customer 
expectations, something which is especially 
important in markets where we are facing an 
aging population and a shortage of skilled 
personnel. In 2021, Hongkong Land’s Chinese 
mainland Graduate Recruitment Programme 
continued to be a major focus of our talent 
management efforts. During the year, 19 new 
trainees on the Chinese mainland joined our 
workforce and subsequently entered our 
18-month trainee programme. The programme 
includes on-the-job training allowing recruits 
to learn the skills necessary to support our 
business. We use various channels for this, 
including a coaching programme led by 
executives, a further education sponsorship 
programme, our Professional Examination 
Sponsorship Scheme, internal training, 
simulations and short video broadcasts.
T alent Development 
Our talent development strategy provides a 
tailor-made development path for employees at 
all levels. We conduct an annual talent review 
that identifies a strategic talent pool and assists 
with succession planning. 
Additionally, during performance appraisals, 
we collect staff feedback on training needs, 
which is then taken into consideration in future 
training programmes. To nurture young talent 
for leadership roles within the Group, we also 
devote resources to employee development 
programmes, ensuring we train the best 
and the brightest to lead our organisation 
in the future. The Hongkong Land Academy 
provides a range of training and development 
opportunities for full-time and part-time 
employees and employees on contract, and 
remains a priority across all our properties. 
Our 24/7 e-learning platform, Connect, offers 
personalised training solutions that support 
our regional talent development strategy and 
continuing business expansion. Given the 
on-going and fluctuating COVID-19 pandemic 
restrictions, we primarily provided courses 
online throughout 2021. During the year, 
employees engaged in a total of 16,956 hours 
of in-person training and 41,933 hours of online 
courses. We are committed to further increasing 
our training hours per employee per year.T alent Attraction,

Diversity  
and Inclusion
Diversity and inclusion are important parts of our daily 
operations at Hongkong Land. We recognise and cater 
to employee needs wherever possible, and we promote 
diversity at all levels of the Group, including through 
education and training. These values are set out in our 
Diversity and Equal Opportunity Policy.
As stated in the Policy, our objective 
is that no one will be treated less 
favourably, or be discriminated 
against, on the grounds of age, 
sex, disability (or association with 
a person with a disability), marital 
status, pregnancy, family status, 
race, colour, ethnic origin, or 
religion. 
We aim to leverage the power of 
a diverse workforce and ensure 
that we offer an inclusive and 
supportive working environment. This begins during the recruitment 
process: Our talent acquisition team 
works closely with various business 
units and non-profit organisation, 
such as MINDSET – a mental health 
charity – to create pathways for 
diverse talent to join us. These 
collaborations have allowed us to 
attract a diverse slate of candidates 
for positions across the Group. 
In addition, Hongkong Land 
actively participates in the Women 
Foundation events and activities.Climate And

Ethical Practices
The Hongkong Land Board has oversight of all 
ethics-related issues. The Board also has overall 
responsibility for the Group’s risk management 
and internal controls, with responsibility for 
oversight delegated to the Group’s Audit 
Committee. Please refer to pages 94-97 of the 
Annual Report 2021.
Hongkong Land’s Code of Conduct clearly 
delineates our policies and expectations with 
regard to the ethical conduct of our staff. 
We have a confidential grievance reporting 
mechanism and escalation procedures 
in place to resolve complaints. The Code 
explicitly prohibits corruption in the form of 
illicit payments and provides guidelines on 
the receipt of gifts and entertainment. If a 
conflict of interest is identified, employees 
are expected to report to their supervisors or 
department heads so appropriate action can 
be taken. There was no breach of our Code of 
Conduct reported in 2021.
Hongkong Land complies with all local legal 
requirements regarding anti-competitive 
practices such as the Competition Ordinance (Cap. 619) in Hong Kong. These include price 
fixing, bid rigging and abuse of dominant 
market power. The Code of Conduct also 
highlights our commitment to providing a fair 
and respectful work environment, free from 
discrimination and harassment, on the grounds 
of race, gender, nationality, religion, disability, 
age, sexual orientation, background or any 
other attribute, in alignment with local laws and 
regulations that apply in each of the jurisdictions 
where we operate. The Code also explains the 
responsibility of every employee to safeguard 
data privacy and information security. 
Business units are required to self-declare their 
compliance with the Code of Conduct every 
six months. Training on the Code of Conduct 
focuses on ethics and anti-corruption and 
is included as part of the induction process 
for new employees. In 2021, 441 new joiners 
completed the Code of Conduct e-learning 
module. Periodic refresher training is also 
planned for existing staff via e-learning. 
In Hong Kong, we invited the Independent 
Commission Against Corruption to deliver 
training sessions. Around 726 staff completed 
the course in 2021. Whistleblowing
Supporting our Code of Conduct is our 
Whistleblowing Policy, which provides a 
clear process and multiple channels through 
which employees can report any suspected 
misconduct or violation of Hongkong Land’s 
expectations for ethical behaviour. This formal, 
anonymous system consists of a confidential 
channel administered through an independent 
third party. Employees may also voice their 
concerns, either verbally or in writing, to their 
supervisor or line manager, head of their 
department or business unit, the Head of 
Human Resources, the Chief Financial Officer 
of Hongkong Land, an Executive Director, 
or the Group’s Counsel, as stipulated in our 
Whistleblowing Policy. Diversity

Staff Communication Channels
The Staff Communication Council is a platform where our employees share 
their ideas, opinions and concerns which are then discussed during Staff 
Council meetings. This process helps to foster company culture, promote 
good employee relations and improve staff morale.
The Management Meeting, chaired by the CE, provides excellent 
communication opportunities to management and team members. It is an 
opportunity for employees to ask direct questions to the CE and receive an 
instant response.
Additionally, the HKL staff mobile application has several new functions 
which facilitate communications with staff:Employee Engagement Survey 
Hongkong Land values open and transparent 
communication with our employees. We carry 
out bi-annual employee engagement surveys, 
conducted by a third party, around our portfolio 
to inquire about overall job satisfaction 
and work-life balance and identify areas for 
improvement in our policies and working 
environment. We followed up on employee 
feedback by the first quarter of 2022.
An employee engagement survey was 
conducted in the Chinese mainland in 2021. The 
average employee satisfaction score was 4.32, 
which was a slight increase of 0.08% compared 
to the 2020 survey results. Employee Recognition Scheme
Our employees regularly go above and 
beyond to exemplify Hongkong Land’s values 
and commitment to excellence. In 2021, 
82 appreciation awards were given out to 
acknowledge and reward staff with outstanding 
achievements or who demonstrated dedication 
to customer service and innovation.

environmental awareness by 
getting colleagues to dress 
“green” – wearing light 
and breathable attire and 
reducing air conditioning 
consumption so as to 
conserve energy and lower 
our carbon footprint.
Our HEROES 
In 2021, we launched a new company-wide employee instant 
recognition programme called Our HEROES, allowing staff 
to recognise each other for actions taken in line with our core 
HEROES values. Recognised staff can earn points and redeem 
prizes including cash vouchers. The programme has led to 
increased employee engagement in Hongkong Land, with 36 
nominations posted between July and December 2021 across 
the regions. Accessed via HKL mobile, the platform also offers 
an interactive function whereby other colleagues can “like” 
and comment on the nominations.
H Points 
Accessed via HKL mobile, the H Points 
scheme provides incentives to staff 
who participate in company initiatives 
including e-learning programmes, 
interactions on the Connect platform, 
nominations to Our HEROES, CSR 
activities, and other designated events.  
Staff can redeem gift vouchers upon 
gaining a certain number of H Points.

The continuing COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted 
the importance of supporting the physical and 
mental wellbeing of all employees and promoting 
work-life balance and an active lifestyle. 
Throughout 2021, Hongkong 
Land proactively supported our 
people, working to ensure that our

During the pandemic, we 
augmented our workplace 
flexibility policies, including 
a flexible working and lunch 
arrangement, as well as  
prioritise virtual meetings  
over physical ones. With the growing importance of 
workplace wellbeing in corporate 
culture, Hongkong Land plans to 
closely monitor the progress of our 
various wellness programmes and 
collect feedback from employees 
on their effectiveness. Team 
members are invited to share 
their ideas and preferences for

The Healthy Land Happy Land programme, conducted online, continued through 2021 in Hong Kong. More than 220 staff members took part in 
online health talks on mental and physical wellness, nutrition, and facts about Chinese medicine. Also, 58 employees took part in a fitness plan and 
exercise classes held between September 2020 and August 2021.
In Beijing, we held a series of wellness initiatives, including providing an annual gym card and an annual medical check to all staff.  There were also 
several corporate activities, Engage with Spring, Family Day, Fruit Challenge, and the WFC Outing.
Engage with Spring
Hongkong Land promoted physical fitness 
and invited team members to plan a route and 
conduct walking exercises during their lunch 
time. They set up a WeChat group and uploaded 
photos and itineraries. In total, 35 colleagues 
took part and uploaded their records – the three 
team members with the shortest time and who 
burned the most calories were selected as the 
winners. Family Day
On the eve of Children’s Day, Hongkong Land 
organised a special family day at the Summer 
Mountain Roller Coaster. A total of 20 family 
groups joined the event, enjoying precious 
time with their family members.Fruit Challenge
In the summer of 2021, Hongkong Land 
organised a sports event, during which several

We value the contributions made by our construction 
workers. Every year, we organise several activities to help 
improve their welfare, including free medical checks, free 
haircuts and more. In 2021, we initiated a book donation 
activity in four cities – Shanghai, Chongqing, Wuhan and 
Chengdu. Around 1,200 books were purchased or donated 
by our staff and then donated to 300 children of construction 
workers.
In other parts of the Chinese mainland, annual medical 
check-ups were organised for 1,383 staff. A large number of 
staff were offered free gym memberships and encouraged to 
join the Group’s sports clubs, particularly the staff Running 
Club which was set up in September 2021 with 70 members 
initially joining. In October, the club held its launch ceremony 
with a Public Welfare Run, which promoted exercise as a

Our Occupational Health and Safety 
Management System 
Hongkong Land’s Occupational Health and 
Safety Policy is our guide to addressing key 
topics identified by our materiality assessment, 
including emergency preparedness and health 
and safety. 
The Sustainability Committee regularly updates 
this policy to reflect changes in policies and 
regulations, and review targets as necessary 
to ensure we are effectively managing our 
material topics. We have robust mechanisms 
in place, including our ISO 45001 management 
system and annual Fire, Life, Health, Safety 
and Security (FLHSS) audits that measure, 
monitor and evaluate performance. After audits 
take place, we then implement any necessary 
remedial or improvement actions. 
Our Projects Department distributes a 
Departmental Health and Site Safety 
Manual. We also place health and site safety 
specifications in works contracts which we 
require contractors to follow, including safety 
plans, safety training, safety inspections. 
Additionally, we conduct quarterly safety audits 
on construction sites.
Our proactive approach to employee health 
is designed to reduce potential safety risks and incidents. We aim to ensure that the work 
environments we provide are healthy, safe and 
comfortable. All Hongkong Land building staff 
receive compulsory health and safety training 
as soon as they join the Group – this allows our 
employees to be up to speed in terms of quality 
and safety immediately after starting work.
Training is also an integral part of Hongkong 
Land’s daily operations. We ensure that anyone 
performing a task that has the potential 
to cause any health and safety impacts is 
competent, in that they have the appropriate 
education, training or experience. We retain 
associated records. Connect, our real-time 
e-learning platform offers on-the-job OHS 
training on such topics as working at height, 
fire safety, electrical work safety, safety 
on manual handling, and others. Connect 
enables employees to acquire this knowledge 
anywhere and at any time. Hongkong Land 
establishes, implements and maintains 
procedures to identify training needs and 
develop programmes to ensure awareness and 
competence at each relevant function and level.
Our Vendor Management Policy also provides 
guidance for the management of contractors 
related to occupational health and safety 
issues. Additionally, our Registered Safety 
Officers (RSOs) conduct regular briefings for 
vendors. Assigned staff also evaluate the safety 
performance of contractors by conducting spot 
checks and rating contractors’ performance 
before, during and after work.
If any serious unsafe acts are discovered, they 
are stopped immediately. Poor performers 
are warned, and have marks deducted in their 
vendor performance evaluations, which in turn 
may affect contractors’ future work bids. We 
also invite our major contractors to contribute 
to discussions during our regular health and 
safety meetings at our Central Portfolio.Occupational

Health and Safety in Hong Kong
At our Central Portfolio, the Health and 
Safety Committee is chaired by our Health 
and Safety Manager and individual building 
groups, including members from the building 
operation and technical teams. The Committee 
meets at least bi-monthly to monitor and 
evaluate safety performance and follow up 
on any inspections. Hongkong Land has 
operated to ISO 45001 standards for years and 
in 2021 we had no fatalities, major incidents 
or confirmed incidents of non-compliance 
with relevant laws or regulations across our 
operations. We maintained zero work-related 
fatalities and high-consequence injuries. Total 
Recordable Incident Rate per 200,000 man-
hours was maintained below 2.0, our target, 
both for our employees and contractors. Our 
Central Portfolio also achieved the FLHSS audit 
requirement of 90 or above.
In 2021, we had one certified first-aider for 
every six frontline staff, over 92% of building 
staff had completed CPR and AED training and 
were qualified, and over 93% of building staff 
in our Central Portfolio had completed the 
Basic Safety Training Course (commonly known 
as the Green Card course).
Additionally, our Property Management 
team signed the Hong Kong government’s 
“Charter on Preferential Appointment of OSH Star Enterprise”. We have pledged to 
prioritise engaging OSH Star Enterprises 
when implementing repair, maintenance and 
alteration and addition work. “Star Enterprises” 
are those which have implemented a safety 
management system, passed a stringent safety 
audit and have fall arresting equipment that 
complies with safety standards.
We delivered over 1,464 OHS class training 
hours, with over 430 on-site workers 
completing OHS e-learning. At the 20th Hong 
Kong Occupational Safety & Health Awards 
2021, we were awarded the OSH Annual Report 
Award – Bronze.

Health, Safety and Security Briefings for 
Contractors
Hongkong Land organises regular health, 
safety and security briefings, conducted 
by our RSOs on a quarterly basis across 
all our properties, or as needed for project 
commencement. RSOs are staff in our Property 
Management Safety and Security Team. These 
briefings cover such topics as safety policies, 
the work permit system and health and safety 
requirements. To date, 75 contractors and 773 
contractor staff have attended these briefings 
at our Central Portfolio since March 2017 .
Due to COVID-19, face-to-face briefings were 
suspended in 2020 and 2021. Instead, we 
prepared e-learning materials to be used by 
all our contractors, covering such topics as 
Hongkong Land’s OHS policy, the work permit 
system, health and safety requirements and 
security issues.

Safety Inspections
Safety inspections enable us to identify potential 
hazards and decide which preventative measures 
to take to avoid accidents and incidents. 
Inspections are carried out in all our managed 
properties across all markets. Safety inspections 
include, but are not limited to, fitting out areas, 
building facilities, F&B outlets, work-at-height 
situations and building maintenance units. 
Inspections are conducted during off hours.
Throughout 2021, our RSOs and building staff 
continued to conduct regular safety inspections, 
which included looking for unsafe conditions 
such as slip and trip hazards caused by trailing 
cables, uneven or damaged floor surfaces, 
defective ladders, and other hazards in fit-

FLHSS Audits
A healthy, safe and secure environment 
starts with understanding potential risks and 
implementing systems to address them. 
Since 2013, our Property Management team 
has conducted FLHSS audits to review risk 
management performance. These audits 
are performed by a third party to ensure 
independence. For the past eight years, we 
have conducted annual audits in all operating 
commercial properties in Hong Kong, Macau, 
Singapore, Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, 
Jakarta, Phnom Penh, and Bangkok. 
The annual audit scope includes general fire 
safety, fire services maintenance, hazard 
control, on-site testing, health and safety in the 
workplace, as well as OHS, business continuity 
plans, security, and safety governance. 
The audit involves document reviews, site 
inspections, tenant visits, fire and life equipment 
testing, on-site emergency drill evaluations, 
and interviews with property managers, 
technical managers, building supervisors, and 
engineers. Once this four-to-six-day process is 
complete, the consultant provides a report with 
recommendations, as well as a list of follow-up 
and remedial actions to be taken. 
One recent example of a recommendation was 
to seal all openings in our mechanical rooms. In 
response, we immediately sealed the openings 
in the walls of our mechanical rooms to limit the 
spread of fire, smoke and other contaminants in 
the event of a fire. We aim to maintain an FLHSS 
score of 90 or above across our operations.Security
Hongkong Land takes security matters such as 
crime and loss prevention extremely seriously. 
We have made substantial investments in 
upgrading our security systems and improving 
physical security across our properties to 
protect our staff, tenants and customers. In 
Hong Kong, a Security Command Centre was 
set up in March 2021, which has enhanced 
CCTV monitoring and security-related incident 
handling. 
In addition to the annual FLHSS audit, a security 
risk assessment (SRA) is conducted on each 
building every three years by an external 
security consultant. The SRA covers all aspects 
of security risk, from global threats to the local 
law and order situation, as well as security 
protection details and other arrangements 
for each building. All observations and 
recommendations made by the FLHSS audits 
and SRAs have been duly addressed.Health and Safety on the Chinese 
mainland
The health and safety of our workers is 
prioritised in numerous ways. The health and 
safety performance of a project is included 
in the performance appraisal of the relevant 
person in charge. In 2021, we continued our 
good health and safety performance, reaching 
520 days without any accidents resulting in 
serious injuries – a leading metric for the 
Chinese mainland. Hongkong Land also 
developed the “i-worker” management system, 
which comprehensively tracks real-time data of 
worker OHS data, along with attendance and 
training records, allowing us to gain a timely 
grasp on any abnormal worker health data.
We also piloted cutting-edge safety technology 
at our Shanghai and Chongqing development 
projects, providing construction site workers 
with waist-assisted and upper-limb-assisted 
exoskeleton robots to reduce occupational 
risks. This is the first time such equipment 
has been used in the construction industry. In 
2022, we will begin rolling out this technology 
at other sites in the hopes of using it at all our 
construction sites.Occupational

contributions, community investment and volunteer 
services. Among the initiatives we support are 
programmes that inspire young people, assist 
economically disadvantaged families, and contribute 
to the betterment of local communities in the 
region. In line with Hongkong Land’s purpose, our 
community programmes strive to inspire, support 
and empower the communities of today, so that 
together we can aspire to a better tomorrow. 
The core of our CSR work takes 
place through HOME FUND: 
Hongkong Land’s signature 
community building initiative, 
established in 2020 to support 
the long-term development of 
our future generations and our 
aspiration to contribute to fostering 
an inclusive society. Through

community in many ways. To provide relief 
from COVID-19, the Philippines office delivered 
medical supplies to frontline workers and 
COVID-19 patients at the Amang Rodriguez 
Memorial Medical Center, with essential anti-
pandemic supplies also donated to schools and 
a government hospital in Marikina. To support 
students to continue their studies while schools 
were shut down, 300 reams of paper were 
delivered to 10 public schools to allow them to 
print distance learning modules. 
Hongkong Land volunteers also participated 
in a Christmas outreach programme at the 
Orphanage for Special Children in Tarlac, home 
for 38 boys and girls. The volunteers played 
games, danced, sang and created art with the 
orphans and donated clothes, art materials, 
smart TVs and prepaid wi-fi cards to support 
the children’s education. The Philippines office 
also conducted a staff tree planting activity at 
Masungi Forest Reserve. 
Hongkong Land provided disaster relief 
response after Typhoon Rai in December 
2021, making a cash donation of US$24,000 
to Mandaue City. The Philippines office also

Shaping and T ransforming Communities
Since our foundation in 1889, Hongkong Land’s 
aim has been to deliver long-term value to 
our stakeholders. Creating long-term value 
depends on the sustainable development 
of our business, our supply chain and the 
communities in which we invest and operate 
within. We understand fully that the portfolios 
we build and operate have significant impacts 
on both the environment and on communities 
at large, and as such we consider how to 
balance needs and interests of different 
stakeholders during the design, construction, 
occupation, and demolition phases of our 
investment and development properties.  
We continuously modernise and revitalise our 
assets while striving to minimise the ecological 
impact of our portfolios to serve the diverse, 
cosmopolitan and ever-changing communities 
in which we operate. 
In Hong Kong’s core Central district, our 
vision has shaped the iconic commercial and financial heart of the city. We have continuously 
reinvested in our portfolio, introducing 
innovative design and architectural elements 
which are essential to the community’s 
experience of working, living, shopping and 
entertainment in the core Central district. 
Hongkong Land built one of the city’s first 
mixed-use buildings in 1931, and its first 
publicly-accessible elevated footbridge in 
1965 – connecting Prince’s Building and the 
Mandarin Oriental Hotel. These features are 
now integral to the liveability and walkability 
of the city providing convenient, accessible 
and temperature-controlled paths widely used 
by the general public regardless of weather 
conditions. Hongkong Land has embarked on 
several significant redevelopments over the 
years, including Chater House in 2002, York 
House in 2006, and the Forum in 2013. 
In Singapore, Hongkong Land overcame the 
challenges of building on a unique site at Marina Square by minimising the impact of 
One Raffles Link on the nearby War Memorial 
Park. The result was our award-winning 
“groundscraper” , which opened in 2000. The 
development’s underground CityLink retail 
mall was designed to enhance the area’s 
connectivity by connecting the City Hall 
MRT station with the nearby Marina Square 
complex, the Convention Centre, and to the 
eventual Esplande Theatres and Esplande MRT 
station.
The Group subsequently built on the expertise 
gained from the One Raffles Link project, and 
in conjunction with JV partners, completed 
One Raffles Quay and the Marina Bay 
Financial Centre complex in 2006 and 2013 
respectively. In just over a decade, Hongkong 
Land’s role and presence in the city evolved 
from operating a single landmark property to 
shaping the present and future of the city’s new 
financial district.

One Raffles Link, Singapore
In support of Singapore’s Land Transport 
Authority’s efforts to enhance urban liveability 
through walking and cycling, Hongkong Land 
recently introduced a new “end-of-trip” facility 
at our One Raffles Link property. This facility, 
which encourages people to use alternate 
transport by providing bicycle parking, lockers 
and a bicycle maintenance station, is one of 
the first in Singapore. We hope that this facility 
inspires our tenants to explore alternative 
modes of travel and reduce their carbon 
footprint by going “car-lite” .The Ring, Chongqing
Opened in mid-2021, The Ring, Chongqing 
collaborated with the Chongqing Bureau

offerings, this development is breaking 
traditional space limitations and bringing 
people together with nature.

Singapore, the Chinese mainland, and other regions in Southeast Asia. Unless otherwise stated, all 
performance data from joint ventures are presented on a 100% basis. The disclosures exclude construction 
sites and leasing properties which have not been in operation for at least one complete financial year. 
 
Notes:
1. Performance data of electricity consumption and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (scope 2) expanded in 
2021 to include all material assets within the reporting boundary and the Group’s corporate offices.

on a 100% basis, including for properties held by joint ventures, the revenue used for this estimate is 
adjusted to include both consolidated revenue of the Annual Report 2021 and revenue at properties held 
by joint ventures on a 100% basis.
8.  Refrigerants refilled refers to R134a, R123 and R22a.

Reporting Boundary:
Social and Community performance data disclosures encompass the Group’s leasing portfolio and developments across 
Hong Kong, Singapore, the Chinese mainland and other regions in Southeast Asia. The reporting boundary was expanded 
from the prior year which covered performance data across the Group’s material operating commercial properties.
 
Notes:
1.  No female top management employee worked in the Singapore Portfolio in 2021 and no top management employee 
worked in Other Regions in 2021.
2. Only in-person training hours are included in Hong Kong Portfolio in the data for 2018 and 2019.
3. Only performance data for EXCHANGE SQUARE in Cambodia is available in Other Regions in the data for 2019.
4. The Employee Satisfaction Survey was conducted on the Chinese mainland Portfolio only in 2021.
5. The absentee rate is calculated as the number of absentee days divided by the total scheduled workdays in the 
reporting year.
6. The fatality rate represents the number of fatalities per 100 employees per year. It is calculated as “total number of 
fatalities as a result of work-related injury multiplied by 200,000 and then divided by total hours worked”.  The factor 
200,000 represents the annual hours worked by 100 employees, based on 40 hours per week for 50 weeks a year.
7 . A high-consequence work-related injury refers to a work-related injury from which the worker could not, did not, or 
was not expected to recover fully to pre-injury health status within six months.
8. The rate of high-consequence work-related injuries represents the number of high-consequence injuries per 100 
employees per year. It is calculated as “total number of high-consequence work-related injuries multiplied by 200,000 
and then divided by total hours worked”.  The factor 200,000 represents the annual hours worked by 100 employees, 
based on 40 hours per week for 50 weeks a year.
9. The rate of recordable work-related injuries represents the number of recordable work-related injuries per 100 
employees per year. It is calculated as “total number of recordable work-related injuries multiplied by 200,000 and 
then divided by total hours worked”.  The factor 200,000 represents the annual hours worked by 100 employees, based 
on 40 hours per week for 50 weeks a year.
10. The lost workday rate (LWR) represents the number of lost scheduled working days per 100 employees per year. It is 
calculated as “total workdays lost due to work-related injuries and ill-health multiplied by 200,000 and then divided by 
total hours worked” . The factor 200,000 represents the annual hours worked by 100 employees, based on 40 hours per 
week for 50 weeks a year.

Independent Practitioner’s Limited Assurance ReportOur assurance was with respect to the year ended  
31 December 2021 information only and we have not 
performed any procedures with respect to earlier periods 
or any other elements included in the Sustainability Report 
2021 and, therefore, do not express any conclusion thereon.
Criteria
The criteria used by the Company to prepare the Identified 
Sustainability Information is set out in the “Introduction” in 
the Sustainability Report 2021 (the “Criteria”) for the year 
ended 31 December 2021. 
The Company’s Responsibility for the Identified 
Sustainability Information
The Company is responsible for the preparation of the 
Identified Sustainability Information in accordance with 
the Criteria. This responsibility includes the design, 
implementation and maintenance of internal control 
relevant to the preparation of Identified Sustainability 
Information that is free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
Inherent limitations
The absence of a significant body of established practice 
on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial 
information allows for different, but acceptable, measures 
and measurement techniques and can affect comparability 
between entities. In addition, greenhouse gas (“GHG”) 
quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty because 
of incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine 
emissions factors and the values needed to combine 
emissions of different gases.
Our Independence and Quality Control
We have complied with the independence and other 
ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics 
for Professional Accountants (including International 
Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics 
Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on 
fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional 
competence and due care, confidentiality and professional 
behaviour. Our firm applies International Standard on Quality 
Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive 
system of quality control including documented policies 
and procedures regarding compliance with ethical 
requirements, professional standards and applicable legal 
and regulatory requirements.
Our Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance 
conclusion on the Identified Sustainability Information 
based on the procedures we have performed and the 
evidence we have obtained. We conducted our limited 
assurance engagement in accordance with International 
Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised), 
Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews 
of Historical Financial Information, and, in respect of 
greenhouse gas emissions, International Standard on 
Assurance Engagements 3410, Assurance Engagements 
on Greenhouse Gas Statements, issued by the 
International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. 
These standards require that we plan and perform this 
engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the 
Identified Sustainability Information is free from material 
misstatement.
A limited assurance engagement involves assessing the 
suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s use of 
the Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the Identified 
Sustainability Information, assessing the risks of material 
misstatement of the Identified Sustainability Information 
whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed 
risks as necessary in the circumstances, and evaluating 
the overall presentation of the Identified Sustainability 
Information. A limited assurance engagement is substantially 
less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in 
relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including 
an understanding of internal control, and the procedures 
performed in response to the assessed risks.
The procedures we performed were based on our 
professional judgment and included inquiries, observation 
of processes performed, inspection of documents, 
analytical procedures, evaluating the appropriateness 
of quantification methods and reporting policies, and 
agreeing or reconciling with underlying records.
 Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing 
the procedures listed above we:
• made inquiries of the persons responsible for the 
Identified Sustainability Information;
• understood the process for collecting and reporting the 
Identified Sustainability Information;
• performed limited substantive testing on a selective 
basis of the Identified Sustainability Information at 
corporate head office to check that data had been 
appropriately measured, recorded, collated and 
reported; and
• considered the disclosure and presentation of the 
Identified Sustainability Information.
The procedures performed in a limited assurance 
engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less 
in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. 
Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a 
limited assurance engagement is substantially lower 
than the assurance that would have been obtained had 
we performed a reasonable assurance engagement. 
Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance 
opinion about whether the Company’s Identified 
Sustainability Information has been prepared, in all 
material respects, in accordance with the Criteria.
Limited Assurance Conclusion
Based on the procedures we have performed and the 
evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our 
attention that causes us to believe that the Company’s 
Identified Sustainability Information for the year ended  
31 December 2021 is not prepared, in all material respects, 
in accordance with the Criteria.
Our report has been prepared for and only for the board of 
directors of the Company and for no other purpose. We do 
not assume responsibility towards or accept liability to any 
other person for the content of this report.
