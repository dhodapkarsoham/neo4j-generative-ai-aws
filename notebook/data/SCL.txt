A MESSAGE  
FROM OUR CEO2020 was a year unlike any other for Shawcor, with 
many related challenges extending well into 2021. 
Compounding the physical threat posed by the  
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, indirect effects of the 
virus on the mental health and well-being of  
Shawcor’s global team have proven to be significant. 
Our priority has been, and always will be, the health 
and safety of our people. We have embraced  
flexible working solutions, reducing employee risk, 
lowering our emissions, and offering greater  
personal choice while continuing to deliver market 
leading customer service. We have also engaged in 
honest discussions around mental health –  
including educational programs and incremental 
support resources for our employees and their 
families – and will continue to invest in solutions 
which enhance the physical and mental well-being 
of everyone who calls Shawcor home.
As with many organizations across virtually  
every industry, our business has endured significant 
supply-chain stress and mobility limitations for the 
last 18 months. While these issues are likely to echo 
through our global community for some time, we will 
continue to utilize the creativity and collaboration  
embedded in our teams to convert these  
challenges into lasting business advantages.  
Rising above these issues, the impacts of climate 
change, including increasingly severe weather  
patterns, are accelerating society’s desire for urgent 
action to lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 
With these conditions as a backdrop, we have asked 
ourselves some critical questions: What are we  
doing? Why are we doing it? How can we do it  
more sustainably? 
Moving forward, Shawcor will embrace an even  
greater focus on the environmental, social, and“The resilience of this  
organization has proven far 
more powerful than the 
pandemic. Our employees, 
our culture, and our  
commitments to technology, 
integrity, and execution  
ensured we didn’t just  
navigate the crisis, we  
furthered our ESG ambitions 
and rebounded to deliver 
new performance records.” governance aspects of our operations and solutions. 
We firmly believe that keeping our employees healthy 
and safe while aggressively reducing our GHG output 
and embracing diversity, equity, and inclusion across 
the organization are the responsible and ethical things 
to do. 
Consequently, on behalf of the thousands of Shawcor
employees around the world, I am proud to share our
climate, diversity, and HSE ambitions. We will continue
to focus on creating an incident and injury-free  
workplace and by 2030 we will:
- Reduce our Total Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions   
   by 50% versus our 2019 baseline
- Improve diverse representation on our  
   senior management team by a minimum of 20% 
Even greater environmental benefits will be achieved 
as we accelerate support for our customers via  
solutions that decrease their carbon output, increase 
their water security, support their electrification of 
transportation, and facilitate their connectivity.  
Shawcor has a proud history of innovation – as we 
continue to innovate in support of our customers, we 
will collectively deliver a more sustainable future. 
I am honored to lead an organization that exhibits 
such a strong social conscience in what we do and 
how we do it. Thank you to our employees, suppliers, 
partners, and customers for your active participation 
on this journey. I am confident that our ESG  
ambitions, along with our commitments to deliver 
greater consistency in performance and even greater  
stakeholder returns will make us a fundamentally 
better organization.

SUPPORTING THE 
ENERGY TRANSITION
THE ALBERTA CARBON TRUNK LINE 
(ACTL) SYSTEM  
A carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS)  
system was implemented in Alberta, Canada to  
capture CO2 from facilities such as refineries and  
fertilizer plants for use in enhanced oil recovery. 
Shawcor provided the coating for the 240 km  
pipeline that transported the CO2 to secure storage  
in a depleted oil reservoir.ENABLING ELECTRIC VEHICLES
The transition to electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles, 
with lower emissions and operating costs, requires 
higher voltage protection to meet safety standards. 
Our customized heat shrink tubing provides  
exceptional protection to electric vehicle’s power  
distribution channels and protects electronic  
components.
      
SUBSEA PIPELINES IN THE NORTH SEA
Offshore subsea field developments in the North Sea 
will now have the opportunity to reduce emissions  
associated with subsea pipeline insulation services. 
Shawcor has launched a novel wet thermal insulation  
system, UL TRA™ LD (Low Density) that provides the 
industry with an alternative to steel Pipe-in-Pipe (PiP) 
systems. The use of UL TRA LD is expected to reduce 
CO2e emissions by approximately 40% when  
compared to the competing PiP alternative. 
      
The sustainable solutions we  
create embody our commitment 
to INNOVATE, INVENT, and  
INVEST in solving our customers’ 
business challenges while  
making business operations – 
theirs and ours – more efficient 
and sustainable. COMPANY INTRODUCTION

POWERING AN AIRPORT WITH SOLAR
The Pittsburgh International Airport implemented  
a power system to increase their energy  
independence by using the natural gas reserve 
directly beneath the site along with a 9,000-panel 
solar array. The solar-gas microgrid avoids repeats of 
past blackouts and delivers excess power to the  
regional electric grid. Shawcor provided engineering 
and inspection services prior to bringing it online as 
the first airport to be completely powered by solar 
and natural gas.WIND TURBINE INSULATION SOLUTION
Harnessing the power of wind turbines safely   
requires insulating a component in the  
generator at high voltages and extreme  
temperatures. A customer utilized Shawcor’s  
innovative heat shrink tube to provide continuous 
protection for operating temperatures up to 220°C 
and provide them with a globally available,  
repeatable, and adaptable solution for offshore  
and onshore wind turbine applications. REFURBISHING NUCLEAR REACTORS
Bruce Power’s refurbishment of four reactor units 
between 2003 and 2012 brought 3,000 megawatts 
(MW) of reliable, inexpensive, and carbon-free  
electricity back to the grid in Ontario. This provided 
70% of the electricity needed to phase out coal in  
Ontario, allowing the province to shut down all coal 
plants. The refurbishment of Ontario’s nuclear fleet 
is running from 2016 to 2033 and spans 12 units. 
Shawcor provided custom engineered wire and cable 
solutions to meet the challenging environment  
within the nuclear reactor.COMPANY INTRODUCTION

WATER  
MANAGEMENT
Shawcor is committed to responsible 
consumption of water and reuse of  
wastewater. Measuring our operational 
dependency on water is a critical step 
in managing our water related risks. 
Our products and services used in  
construction, energy, manufacturing, 
and agriculture are dedicated to the 
protection, management, and  
conservation of water.
An 8,000-gallon double-wall fiberglass tank 
was installed as part of the treatment system 
for Alaska’s Red Dog mine, operated by Teck 
Resources Limited. The treated wastewater 
must adhere to strict discharge guidelines to 
protect the quality of the waterbody flowing 
downstream from the mine where a native 
Iñupiat village is located.ARCTIC CIRCLE WASTEWATER  
TANK INSTALLATION
A 25,000-gallon tank was installed at a solar-powered Panelview RV Park in Northeastern Oregon, when the 
owners upgraded their septic system in 2020. The RV park is in a sensitive groundwater area, located within 1,000 
feet of the Umatilla River. To have sufficient water for landscaping, the new system had to incorporate wastewater 
treatment for reuse. PANELVIEW RV PARK WASTEWATER TANK INSTALLATION

WASTE  
MANAGEMENT
We strive to manage our waste  
efficiently by reducing, reusing,  
repurposing, and recycling wherever 
possible throughout our business  
operations. Each facility makes 
individual efforts to initiate innovative 
waste management techniques.  
One of those initiatives involves the 
formation of on-site Green Teams. 
The teams identify opportunities to:
IMPROVE RECYCLING 
RECOVER SCRAP MATERIALS
REDUCE PACKAGING WASTE
REUSE INDUSTRIAL SUPPLIESEXPANDING A RECYCLING PROGRAM
Recycling and waste reduction programs divert waste 
from landfills. Our team in Calgary historically baled 
cardboard before shipping it to a vendor for recycling. 
They implemented a cardboard compactor which 
made shipments to the vendor much more efficient. 
More importantly, it allowed them to use the old baling 
equipment to expand their program to soft plastics. 
Now both cardboard and soft plastics are easily  
transported to a vendor for recycling.
      
30,400 lbs
Recycled corrugated 
cardboard at a single site
FLOW ASSURANCE SOLUTION
Shawcor has completed the first application of 
LotusFlo™ technology in the Norwegian North 
Sea for the Duva Project. LotusFlo was designed 
to reduce the deposition of inorganic and 
organic solids on the interior of tubulars and 
pipelines. This minimizes the need for 
petrochemical inhibitors and offshore well 
interventions, reducing waste and oil leak risks 
associated with such remedial processes.

COVID-19  
RESPONSE
COVID RESPONSE TEAM
A company-wide emergency response team was  
established for COVID-19 prevention and containment  
following the World Health Organization (WHO) and  
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  
guidelines. The team monitored the impact on our  
staff, operations, and customers 24/7. Local teams  
provided frontline support for our employees, focusing  
on compliance with local and regional government health 
guidelines. Throughout the unprecedented and 
rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic, 
we continued our essential operations 
while prioritizing what matters  
most  - the HEAL TH, SAFETY, AND 
WELL-BEING of our employees,  
customers, and the communities in 
which we work. 
REMOTE WORK
Remote work was promoted wherever possible as were new ways 
to foster engagement and connection. 
ON-SITE WORK  
Risk of COVID exposure was reduced with site screening, mask  
requirements, social distancing, staggered shifts, and travel  
limitations. 
A new working paradigm lets pets, like Alma, be part of our work life.COMPANY INTRODUCTION

Every management meeting begins with a discussion 
on our HSE performance. Our business leaders provide 
updates on observations, near misses, incidents, and 
lessons learned for their respective groups. We continue 
to closely evaluate our HSE performance while looking for 
opportunities to manage our HSE related risks and reduce 
incidents.HEAL TH, SAFETY 
& ENVIRONMENT
Our vision is an Incident and Injury Free 
(IIF) workplace with no harm to people 
or damage to the environment.
Protecting the health and safety of 
our employees, contractors, and other 
stakeholders while minimizing our  
impact on the environment is essential. 
ORIENTATION AND TRAINING
HSE onboarding for employees and contractors covers 
our HSE policy, HSEMS, site standard operating 
procedures, and potential consequences, including health 
and safety hazards and environmental impacts. Workers 
can only operate without continuous supervision once 
they have completed the necessary training and their 
managers have confirmed that they can work safely. 94,116
Training hours were logged by Shawcor  
in 2020. Examples of training include:IIF

HAZARD  
IDENTIFICATION 
AND RISK  
MANAGEMENT
WE ALL HAVE A PART TO PLAY in 
identifying hazards, risks, and  
reduction measures at every  
level — corporate, division, and 
site. Employees contribute in  
individual and group forums,  
including:
LEADERSHIP RESPONSIBILITIES
Division and site managers partner with an 
HSE professional to maintain a hazards and 
aspect registry. The registry identifies  
activities, products, and services and their 
associated risks, likelihood of occurrence, 
impact, and the mitigation strategy. Site 
managers oversee compliance with legal and 
other requirements including government 
regulations, permitting, and industry  
standards.AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS
Formal HSE worksite audits are conducted every one to three years, based on risk assessments, HSE performance,  
compliance performance, and previous findings. HSE-focused activities and internal audits are included in our  
employee’s annual performance objectives, starting with Shawcor’s CEO and cascading through the organization.  
Site Managers conduct monthly audits, based on employee reported incidents, near misses, and hazard identification.  
If an incident occurs, investigations are conducted after any immediate health and safety concerns have been  
addressed. Injuries and illnesses, environmental incidents, and property damage are assessed to determine root  
causes, lessons learned, and whether it is classified as recordable under U.S. Occupational Health and Safety  
Administration (OSHA) standards.JOINT HEAL TH AND SAFETY COMMITTEES

Employees can challenge and communicate any

them to use their stop work authority. 2020 10 6,071 22,990

Many of our employees worked from home during COVID, reducing the auditable population. We maintained our 
focus on safety by continuing formal HSE audits virtually, and continued to see high volumes of informal audits 
and employee observations.

TRACKING & COMMUNICATING 
HSE PERFORMANCE
Shawcor uses software accessible to all employees to centralize,  
standardize, and analyze HSE data and processes. This across-the-board 
accessibility means Shawcor can provide training content; report and track 
incidents, near misses, and hazards from anyone anywhere; log audit,  
inspection, and observation activity; and create a dashboard view of overall 
HSE performance in real-time. DRIVING SAFEL Y
A coaching-based driving program was implemented 
in 2019 for company vehicles using in-vehicle  
monitoring systems (IVMS) to reduce potential 
driving risk. The IVMS provides details on speed,  
braking, and acceleration for every company vehicle.

HEAL TH &  
WELLNESS
MENTAL HEAL TH
Mental well-being was a strong focus before the pandemic started. COVID-19 heightened the need to provide 
programs for employees. Programs developed to raise awareness targeted: 
• Fostering a supportive culture and open channels of  communication 
• Offering regular virtual events centered on mental health and well-being 
• Providing education to expand knowledge of diverse mental health issues 
• Encouraging mindfulnessHealth and wellness extend  
beyond the walls and hours of  
our operations. 
BENEFITS
Our competitive benefits packages provide  
comprehensive health and wellness  
resources. Company and employee led  
initiatives are held throughout the year to 
promote mental and physical health. For  
example, one of our businesses hosted a 
health week, which included daily tips and 
activities such as virtual meditation, fitness 
sessions, and a step challenge that ran an 
entire month.  
Shawcor also provides maternity,  
paternity, and parental leaves (including 
adoption leaves) in accordance with  
jurisdictional legislation. COMPANY INTRODUCTION
